lufthansa;2018-09-11;" |  Miami to Frankfurt. Lufthansa claims to have gate arrival/transfer assistance for First Class passengers. On LH463, First Class (paid) on June 26, 2018, I arrived in Frankfurt with a relatively short connection. I had asked the purser onboard if gate assistance would be provided, as I was unfamiliar with the Frankfurt airport and had heard horror stories about maneuvering through this older maze of an airport. I was assured there would be gate assistance. After leaving the A380 - huge masses of people were herding in every direction imaginable and no one from Lufthansa greeted the flight or was there to assist First Class passengers. Over an hour later, I managed to find my way to the First Class lounge where the agents were clueless and acted like I was expecting too much to expect assistance, even after I had asked about it and tried to confirm it would be available. Lufthansa in fact does not provide gate assistance in all cases for First Class passengers and their rating should reflect this case. In addition, Wifi was not working on the flight even though the aircraft was Wifi equipped. Cabin crew could have cared less and suggested I enjoy time away from my computer!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-09-07;" |  My wife and I recently flew from Houston to Florence with a connection in Frankfurt. We arrived at 09:00am, went through customs which took over an hour, walked to terminal B, went through the slowest, most inefficient security line I have ever seen, then walked to our gate. We arrived at the gate at 11:08am and were told they had already closed the gates and could no longer board us even though the plane was still sitting there. I assumed this wouldn’t be a major problem considering it’s not that uncommon to miss a connecting flight and assumed we would be put on the next flight out to Florence. To my dismay, we were told that it was our fault we missed the connection, that the airline was not informed of any delays or long wait times in customs or security and that we would not only have to buy a new flight, but the return home flights were also canceled because we missed the connection. I’ve never felt more abused as a customer of any product or service in my life. I would never recommend Lufthansa. We were even talked down to like we were children by the customer service representatives.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-09-07;" |  Geneva to Olbia via Frankfurt. We chose Lufthansa over cheaper options for their better time schedule for our flight to Olbia where we'd spend our vacations. The outbound flight was delayed 15 mins. This was sufficient for us to miss our Lufthansa connection in Frankfurt where after running to the connecting gate the Lufthansa personnel told us the gate had closed 5 min before and the bus connection to our plane was not available anymore. They stated nobody informed them about the connection and that there was no possibility for us to board the plane. We were re-routed to another flight (double the duration) and the plane we missed ended up taking off 20 min after we reached the gate. Customer treatment has been sub-par, inflexible and impolite in providing us explanations. This our 3rd flight in a row from Geneva to Frankfurt where we have issues. Last 2 were cancelled due to  adverse weather conditions. Service on board was ok while the planes were not the newest at an above average cost.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-09-06; |  Chennai to Frankfurt. Arrived at the airport two hours prior to take off. The Checkin was prompt and without any wait. Was sent to the Lounge none of which have much room. The boarding was effortless. The seat was on the harder side - like most German cars and usually the provide very good support. Mine was set at hardness level 3 and did the trick. The service in the plane was very efficient. The cabin staff did a commendable job in serving the us promptly. The food was good but I didn't want to eat yet another Dhal and Paneer with Rice dish! The inflight entertainment was mediocre. The selection was good but not as good as some 5-Star airlines. The flight took off on time and landed early in FRA.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-09-05;" | Flight LH414 (MUC-IAD) was delayed over 4 hours. It happens. Had to re-book the connecting flight for the next day and had to book a hotel in Washington DC overnight on my own. It happens. What I never saw happening until this flight was the complete lack of help from the airline. No help in re-booking (United helped here) and no help with accommodation overnight (flight landed close to midnight and no more connections were possible). On top of that Lufthansa is completely unresponsive to calls or emails after the ordeal. Customer Support asks for receipts for the costs incurred. Once those are submitted: Silence, just nothing.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-29;" | Flew Newark to Kiev via Frankfurt, and returned from Vienna to Newark via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The inflight entertainment system on the trans-Atlantic flights had a decent selection of movies and music, but my screen kept freezing and crashing, and had to be reset, on both long-haul flights. The food on the EWR-FRA segment was okay, but the chicken meal on the FRA-EWR flight was absolutely horrible. Decent bar service on both long-hauls though. The European flights offered a sandwich with beer/wine/soft drinks, few airlines offer any complimentary service on short-haul flights, so that was nice. My biggest complaint would be that en-route to Kiev, my suitcase was destroyed at Frankfurt airport so I had to buy a new one upon arrival in Kiev. Also, my VIE-FRA connection was too short to be comfortable, 45 minutes to connect at a huge airport like Frankfurt is really stressful. I just barely made it to the gate a few minutes before they closed the doors. My already short connection was made even shorter due to the fact that the flight from Vienna landed what seemed like several miles from the actual terminal, and we were then treated to a 15-minute bus tour of Frankfurt airport, so I ended up literally having to run all the way to my next gate. Overall, I'd still fly LH again, they're still better than any USA-based airline, as well as better than many European ones, but as a supposed 5-star carrier, they really need to improve the food on long-haul flights, work out the glitches in the entertainment system, and take better care of passengers' luggage.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-28; |  Newark to Tel Aviv via Munich. The bad service started at check in time. There was a technical issue and I was not able to get my boarding passes. So i called the call center to make sure the seats are confirmed and all i will have to do is get the boarding passes at the airport. I was assured it was ok and we had the 4 seats together. Then at the airport I found out it was not true. The seats are very hard and unconfortable. The special food we ordered was not delivered on the long flight. On the flight back we were kept on the plane for over 4 hours of delays without understanding how long it was going to take to take off. All in all a terrible experience.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-28;" |  Orlando to Frankfurt. My flight out of Orlando on August 12th was delayed because of weather therefore I missed my connecting flight from Frankfurt to Split. When departing aircraft there was no help whatsoever on support of getting another connecting flight. Finally found a counter that was open with only 4 individuals working and approx. 80 people in line. After standing in line for 2.5 hours I looked up other flights going into Split and the only one left was at 1600 hours. I knew then that we would not make it if we continued to stand in the line that we were currently in. After going through customs into Germany we approached a counter that was loaded with individuals - on the other side there was only 2 lady's working so I spoke with an agent and told her my situation and she took care of us and was very helpful in explaining were we needed to go. We did make the flight thanks to her. I think Lufthansa needs to hire more people like her, excellent customer service!";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-26;" |  San Jose to Munich via Frankfurt.  Zero options offered for breakfast, a foil-covered scrambled egg, tomato and sausage combination. Entertainment options were pretty meh. Coming from someone who is accustomed to United levels of service, I was pleasantly surprised that Lufthansa took the time to rebook me on the next available flight when the flight delay for my first leg caused me to miss a connection. As a result, I arrived earlier than I had planned.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-23; |  Flying from Belgrade to Brussel via Munich with Lufthansa was very nice. Departure on time on both leg and the crew was friendly. Drinks and snack was for free. The seat was comfortable and the plane was clean. I would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-23;" |  The website and mobile app work really bad for me: slow, not user-friendly, old layout, etc.  Not possible to select seats for the first flight (operated by Air Dolomiti - which is Lufthansa Group), and for the return flight from LAX to Munich with a Lufthansa flight. Check in available 48 hrs before departure. Boarding a mess. Lufthansa staff doing nothing for 1h then not able to handle a proper boarding. I found the food in the airplane disgusting. Lost a luggage.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-22;" | Very good airline. Flying from Belgrade to Brussel via Munich, I must say that Lufthansa is very professional. Clean airplane, free drink and snack. The crew were very friendly and during the flight gave us all data about our flight. I recommend using this airline.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-21;" |  Chicago to Munich. They asked us to check our carry on because it was overweight. People were bringing in larger pieces. At the airport in Munich it took over an hour to find the luggage. Worst Economy seats on a newer plane, sure! More efficient perhaps, but avoid Lufthansa’s A350.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-20;" |  We were flying from Lyon to Philadelphia through Frankfurt. We had a very short layover in Frankfurt and our flight from Lyon to Frankfurt was delayed. The pilot announced several times that the flights from Frankfurt were also delayed and not to worry. Nevertheless, we ran as quickly as possible to make our connection to Philadelphia. The gate agents practically laughed at us and said that flight was long gone. The truth was we arrived at our gate at 1:45pm, the flight was delayed until 2:10pm (according to an email I received from Lufthansa) and did not actually take off until 2:30pm (according to FlightAware). Yet, Lufthansa did nothing to get us on that plane (I assume it was out on the tarmac - the busing around the Frankfurt airport to and from the planes is ridiculous). Instead, we had to go to customer service and were re-booked on a flight the following day. Customer service actually seemed annoyed that they had to deal with us. Then to make matters worse, the customer service rep said they would book us at a nice hotel in center city so we could see Frankfurt. The hotel was no where near center city - we were in some warehouse district that was not walking distance to anything. To get to center city was a walk and two bus rides away or a 40 euro round trip taxi ride. Ridiculous! The extra 24 hours in Frankfurt was awful and I couldn't wait to get out of there. It was seriously the most money I have ever spent on an airline ticket ($1900+ per person) and the worst experience I ever had. I have flown many times and have seen airlines go out of their way to make sure the passengers make their connections. Not Lufthansa. I would not fly with them again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-19;" |  Seoul to Oslo via Munich. The new A350 felt some claustrophobic. For me I think almost all airlines need to work on the food. The portion is little if you are hungry for 10/11 hours. Lufthansa delivers efficiency. Munich-Oslo went smooth, nice pusher on the evening flight. I will again fly Lufthansa in the future, as I have previously done.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-19;" |  Berlin to Bangkok via Munich. I was booked onto Lufthansa as as I wanted a relaxed and relatively comfortable flight. First flight was ok. Got a beer a snack and was on time. Switched into the Bangkok flight in Munich and realised this was a Eurowings codeshare. If you want inflight entertainment you pay 9.90 EUR, a blanket 6 EUR, headphones 3 EUR. Apparently I had been booked in the SMART tariffs, so I got 1 alcohol drink and a spartan meal. Had to pay for my beer. When I asked how I get such service with Lufthansa, I was told I could see it was an Eurowings flight by looking at the flight Number. I understand Eurowings is a budget airline, however Lufthansa is not. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-18;" |  . I booked to fly with Lufthansa from London to Zagreb via Frankfurt on a Wednesday evening. The check-in staff told me that the first flight was delayed so I would miss the connection. The impression was this was very much my problem and I should speak to the reservations line. Reservations changed me to a flight via Vienna to stay the night in a hotel courtesy of the airline and fly to Zagreb early the next day. I was satisfied with this. I asked the check-in staff whether I should get the hotel voucher from them or from Vienna airport - they were clear that I should collect this from the Austrian Airlines representative at Vienna airport. On arrival at Vienna I was told by the Austrian Airlines representative that Lufthansa had put no information on their system relating to my needing accommodation for the night. They spent 20 minutes trying to contact Lufthansa reservations and were not able to - on speaking to a representative at the Frankfurt Lufthansa headquarters the Austrian Airlines rep was told ""that's not my responsibility"". There was a pop concert on in Vienna - there were no rooms or only rooms with inflated prices available and I could not afford the cost of a taxi to/from the city and a hotel myself. I approached two hotels in walking distance who told me they had rooms only accessible with a voucher. Austrian Airlines would not provide me with a voucher without Lufthansa indicating on their system that this was agreed. The rep apologised for the experience I was having due to Lufthansa but was  unable to act without their ticking a box on the system.  I spent the night on the floor of the airport.  I emailed Lufthansa that night expressing my frustration and requesting compensation. I have heard nothing back over a week later and just spent 25 minutes waiting on their customer services line without getting through to a representative. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-17;" |  Florence to Bangkok via Frankfurt. I sent this note to customer service because of the sweetheart that helped me get home. After a delayed flight from Sofia to Frankfurt, I missed my connection back to Florence which in and of itself would not be a problem if I did not have another flight the very next day from Rome to Bangkok, ironically connecting in Frankfurt again. The flight was not on the same booking as I had taken a last minute trip to Bulgaria and felt comfortable giving myself one day in Florence before my flight back to Bangkok. What would have been a few busy days of traveling quickly turned into a nightmare. After a long walk to terminal B to the transfer counter, which I could not find and was not clearly marked, me and hundreds of other frustrated and tired customers got in line. Standing there I realized that I could potentially miss my return flight to Bangkok the next day because of a one hour delay. my best laid plans were ruined. As I inched forward slowly to the front of the line, I could see the agitated groups of people huffing and puffing about their misfortune. I started to feel a tinge of panic too. Standing in the very front I looked at the flashing number and approached the counter. I was greeted with a welcoming smile and cheerful voice. Already an amazing feat as far as I was concerned seeing the amount of verbal abuse that was going on at the counters while I was waiting. This immediately put me more at ease. I explained my predicament: If the earliest flight from Frankfurt to Florence landed at 9:30, I would not get home to get my other bag and drop off the keys to my friend's apartment until at least 10:30, it's a 30 minute walk to the train station and a taxi is not much quicker then I would have to hope there was a train right away. If my some twist of fate I got an 11:15 train, I'd be at Rome central station at 12:45 and then have to hope again there was a coinciding train to the airport just at that moment which would get me there around 1:30pm for a 2:55pm flight and that is if absolutely everything went my way carrying two pieces of luggage in the hot August sun. Maybe some daredevils think that is plenty of time but I'm a traveler that arrives 3 hours early for every flight. Just thinking about that time frame was causing me stress. The friendly woman behind the counter listened and empathized with a smile. She could have just told me that even though both flights were with Lufthansa because they were on different bookings that there was nothing she could do. She could have politely told me that the 8:30am flight was the best she could do or brushed off my concerns and turned her attention to the hundreds of people behind me. But instead she really took my case as a whole, as a human being with a problem that she could help solve. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-17;" |  Frankfurt to Keflavik. Cabin service is very slow, food and beverage of low quality. The flight was late and they lost our luggage. The seat is uncomfortable unless for a flight of more than 4 hours.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-16;" |  Berlin-Tegel to Munich. I tried to check-in via the App/website but that did not work as I was travelling with special needs. At the airport, I checked-in and wanted to change to an earlier flight in order to have more time for my connecting flight in Munich. Unfortunately, there is no Lufthansa employee in the entire Lufthansa check-in is area as it is handled by a third party and they could not help me. The Lufthansa ticket counter - which is at the other end of the terminal - also could not help me because it actually just is a ticket counter for all airlines instead of a specific Lufthansa ticket counter. I find it disappointing that there is no Lufthansa agent in the check-in area or at the ticket counter at Berlin-Tegel, an airport at which Lufthansa is the biggest airline. So I gave up and went to the Senator Lounge and found Tegels one and only Lufthansa agent on duty there at the entrance: She actually was very helpful but by the time I got there it was too late to change to an earlier flight. The flight itself was on-time because the crew was outstanding: They helped during boarding so that we got off the ground on time. They informed us about our connecting flights and did a great service. Very good onboard service. Very poor ground service at Berlin-Tegel.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-16;" |  I had a flight from Munich to Frankfurt via Lufthansa then a connecting flight to Toronto via Air Canada. I missed my connecting flight due to delay in loading luggage. I was stranded at Frankfurt airport and had to find out what next to do. It was my first time missing a connecting flight. The staff at Lufthansa was knowledgeable and help direct me to the service desk (although it took a while, understandable due to the size of the airport). At the service desk, the employee was helpful and kind. I was giving a voucher for the hotel, dinner, breakfast, and transportation. They put me on the next flight to Toronto for the next day. This helped alleviate my distress and it showed that Lufthansa strived to do right by their customers when a mistake is made. On the flight, the staff and Lufthansa work hard to make the economy not feel like an economy cabin. We were given hot towels twice, headphones, blankets, snacks, drinks, and food. I've been to other airlines and they don't usually give out that much. It makes the flight bearable and quick. The in-flight entertainment was great, I've binge-watched the latest movie and was quite the happy flyer. Lufthansa has exceptional staff and I would definitely try to get future flights on their airline if possible.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-15;" |  New York to Stockholm via Munich. Ground service at JFK is horrible. I don’t know if it’s company policy, but they grilled me harder than any immigration agent. First, I couldn’t even check in online because they asked me for a visa/permit to enter Germany, which wasn’t even my final destination? I have a Hong Kong passport, not China and I don’t need visa for schengen. They saw my ticket was for 5 months, so asked to see proof of my “residency permit” in Sweden. I showed them the letter from the Swedish migration agency, which obviously is mostly in Swedish, but they did not consider it enough or readable.  Eventually, I managed to get past the counter via showing the Swedish school’s acceptance letter. The only reason I gave 3/10 and not 1/10 is because of their air crew and service, which is good, and one of the ground personnel who knew German and helped me out a bit with the translation and arguing to let me pass.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-14;" |  Dublin to Frankfurt in business class. My experience was mixed, and certainly not what I would have expected from a five-star airline. Check-in in Dublin and the lounge in terminal 1 were fine. Boarding is where problems occurred. The plane arrived late from Frankfurt. This can happen and is not a big deal. We left and arrived about 30 minutes late. I would have expected the ground crew to offer some information and explanation to the lined-up passengers. This did not happen. We were just left to stand in line for 30 minutes. Part of that time was spent uncomfortably in the jet bridge. When I politely asked a member of the ground crew to explain what was happening, I was rebuked for my impertinence. Even stranger, during the flight there was no mention of the delay, as though this were perfectly normal. Service on board was acceptable. The food was quite nice, but it was served hastily, with little attention to detail. For example, I was almost finished with my food when drinks arrived.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-14;" | Beijing to Munich on Lufthansa. Checked in with the help of an agent who spoke minimal English and was eager to see me through. Used the Air China Business Lounge which was hot, stuffy and had no cold beverages. Boarding was delayed as with my most experience at Beijing airport and announcements were inaudible. Once aboard I had a choice of several empty seats so I picked a seat without a neighbour. The hard product is OK but not all seats have direct aisle access. All seats were supplied with a thin mattress and we were given sleeping shirts once airborne. The service was excellent with FA’s checking on passengers frequently. The food was well presented but was uninspiring. The beverage selection was very good with a wide array of wines and champagne. The IFE had a large selection but could have used more recent releases. The location of the headphone jack is a total pain if one chooses to use his own headphones instead of those supplied. The flight departed late but arrived on time. It is not hard to see how Lufthansa has been climbing up in the rankings. They are deserving of the 5-star ranking.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-13;" |  Malta to London via Frankfurt. No frills flights. As usual Lufthansa was efficient and courteous. Only trouble: from FRA to Heathrow aircraft's a A321 instead of A320. Lufthansa has just changed everyone seats numbers at the last minute, and of course we were much further back in the plane, with a lot of empty seats in front of us. A detail.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-12;" |  Luxembourg to Frankfurt. Two flights the same day, both flights late (no strike reason). Prices are 3 times higher than low cost airlines but worse service.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-12;" |  Münster/Osnabrück to Kraków via Frankfurt. Half an hour before departure there was an announcement that the flight to Frankfurt of 6:35AM was cancelled. So, we went back to the check-in desk. There we were put on the 2:40PM flight, 8 hours later. They did give us 10 euro per person for food and drinks, which was sufficient. After 8 hours of waiting it was finally time for boarding. However, this didn't go as planned either, because we had an aborted takeoff due to an overheated engine. We had a bit of hope that it would be fixed in 10 minutes, but after we were told that the luggage is on the carousel, we went back to the check-in desk again. This time we were put on the flight of 6:20PM, and also got an additional 22 euro for food and drinks per person. That quickly became 7:10PM after a delay. Then, 13 hours late, we finally took off to FRA on the 30 minute flight. Apart from this all, the flight was smooth and uneventful. FRA is a huge airport with lots going on, yet it is quite easy to find your way. The flight to KRK was on time and really smooth, and the drinks and sandwich were better than expected, and legroom was amazing, me being over 2m tall, so i can't fault the flight itself and how they handled the cancellation. I wouldn't recommend them though, since our flight was far from the only one being late/canceled.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-12;" |  Lyon to Munich. Flight had 2 hours delay. Because of the delay there was no more public transportation when I arrived in Munich andI had to go to Augsburg. The cabin crew advised us to go to the service center when arriving at the airport. Problem is at that time there was nobody. So I decided to take a taxi to Augsburg for 160€. I wrote the customer service who replied pretty fast to inform me that this was not covered, so that they would not pay anything. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-12;" |  Frankfurt to Bogota. Flight was overbooked. Worse was the behavior of the lady at the counter who welcomed us by saying that it was a difficult situation because we were arriving ""pretty late"".

lufthansa;2018-08-12;" |  Frankfurt to Munich. I'm very disappointed about the service level of Lufthansa. The first flight was overbooked and we were informed by the staff in the airport that we have to wait as we didn't check in earlier. On the flight back we arrived and they lost one of our baggage. Mistakes can happen, however, the lack of empathy and politeness level of the customer service in the airport was very poor.";NEGATIVE

The day before departure at 11.00 pm, I receive an SMS with a link that did not work, to signal that there was a problem with the flight the next morning. I could not contact anyone. All services were closed. I went to the airport in the morning at 6:00 am, and all the passengers were already gone or relocated. There was only me left. I headed for a general counter where staff took care of me and found me a replacement flight with Turkish Airlines. I cannot advise Lufthansa. It's a lot of problems. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-10;" | Lufthansa's Economy Class is highly recommended, so good in fact that you should not bother to upgrade to its Premium Economy. This is the first time I flew economy with LH in some years, and I was very pleasantly surprised at the high level of service. Although the seats were a bit worn and long in the tooth, they were comfortable. Legroom and overall room was ample. Service was very good. The staff was very pleasant and efficient, Inflight Entertainment was generally good. There are a few glitches with their IFE system, and the selection is again good but not great. Food was generous but of mediocre quality. Snack and beverages were generous. Nice pillows, quality blankets, and decent headphones are provided. I highly recommend LH's economy class option. It is well worth the money.";POSITIVE

The representative told me that the bulkhead seats in premium economy were spacious and comfortable with loads of legroom and superior service and amenities.  Legroom was poor. Service was decent but somewhat cold and mechanical. Meals were the same as economy. The In-Flight entertainment system was just OK. I cannot fathom that Lufthansa is a 5 star airline and they get away with such a sub-standard product.  Save your money and fly LH economy. You'll do yourself a favor.";NEGATIVE

Because we found it strange that a mother cannot sit with her children we changed our seats. My advise to Lufthansa is. arrange this kind of things before the flight or disable row 43 online if you know there are small children on board that need the bassinet. We also had a delay of more than two hours.;NEGATIVE

I book a five hour layover for a reason and they said two hours was fine to my connecting flight to San Francisco. Let’s hope so. I hope my mother doesn’t have to fly home alone and have no one at the other end.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-08-02;" |  London to Frankfurt in Business Class. I got the advertised product along the whole trip in an efficient way. Priority security line, lounge access (four Star Alliance lounges available in LHR T2, its worth it to try them all), priority boarding, seating, meal service - it worked as you can expect it as a premium customer. The whole crew was doing a fabulous job. From my point of view, Lufthansa maintained the level of the product during the last two years. The only point is connectivity. They had a Wifi in this aircraft, but it is quite expensive, there is no difference between economy and business. As the flight is short, this is not a big point. Some plugs to charge the mobile devices would be nice. As I got a good fare, this flight was perfect value for money.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-31;" |  Hong Kong to Munich. The flight was very pleasant. I had an exit row seat in the upper deck that has only 5 rows of economy. The flight attendant serving the meals was extremely friendly and the service was quick and attentive. As there are only a few rows of Y in the upper deck, the atmosphere was good and the lavatory almost always unoccupied. There is a small galley where you can get drinks inflight. Moreover, from time to time, the attendants walked through the aisles with a tray full of drinks (mostly water and juice). As I was hungry, I asked for some more crackers they served at the start and could take as much as I wanted to. The food wasn't excellent but sufficient for a 12 hrs flight. Its taste was okay. I had a very pleasant experience with Lufthansa on this flight and would take this airline again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-31;" |  I intended to take a flight from Basel to Munich and transfer to another one to Split. The original transfer time was one hour and forty minutes, which is more than enough. However, the boarding time was delayed twice as I was waiting in Basel airport and the final estimated transfer time is only 25 minutes. So I asked the front desk what should I do in order to catch my second plane, and she  couldn't give a useful answer, saying you should be able to catch it. As I got on board, I asked the crew several times about whether there is a fast track for transfer and whether they have further information about my second device. All the feedback I got was ""I couldn't give any information"" and ""sorry we don't have the device to check"". By the time I get off the plane, I still have five minutes to catch up. However, I have to take the shuttle bus and across the gate control. This is simply no way for me to speed up. I ran  but was still ten minutes late for my second flight. So I have to go to the service center for the rebook. But the queue is super long. They only open up to 5 desks to serve hundreds of people.  And the officials didn't even provide a place to live or a decent dinner as a compromise. This isn't my first experience of a tight transfer so I do have some example to compare. I remember when I took a Swiss airline from Beijing to Zurich, the plane was late due to frost for two hours. However, during the flight we kept get updated information from the crew. And as soon as I arrived at the Zurich airport, there are officials guiding us how to go and the transfer was really fast. Eventually everyone was happy about it. If the connection could just be a little more well organized, they could help me catch up my second flight and help many others.";NEGATIVE

Good selection of films but the music choice was awful. Headphones in PE were rubbish, had to use my own noise cancelling ones. The flight back on the A350 via MUC was OK but my headphone connector was broken so no movies or music available. No real attempt to sort the problem out either by cabin staff. ";POSITIVE

I'm sorry to report that not only have the standards in flight service dropped, there no variety of snack foods in the galley between meals. Last time there were apples, chocolate bars, crisps and biscuits. And the food during mealtime (I have low fat meals) was less. SQ seats (due to the lower leg support and the foam in the seat itself) is in my opinion more comfy. And the noise cancelling headphones in SQ make a difference. The crew was friendly, personable and efficient. They were just let down by what LH was supplying. The DUS-FRA flight was cancelled via email/sms 5hours prior. Upon arriving at DUS to see what alternatives were available as nothing had yet been listed in the LH App and LH disconnected my attempted phone call 5 times whilst in waiting queue, they were most apologetic and had our complimentary replacement ICE High Speed train tickets to Frankfurt printed out and ready to go, along with a time table, within 10mins, which was much appreciated. The LH only check-in located directly upstairs from the FRA airport train station was also handy. Apart from less luggage allowance (46kgs vs 35pp) and the better, quieter front of place positioning of seats on LH with PE exclusive toilets on A380, you will appreciate the food, seat, entertainment and priority check-in and priority baggage tags compared to LH.";POSITIVE

On my flight home, they took away my window seats after I had checked in online. Instead, they gave me middle seats and told me that I need to pay extra fee to secure seats.  When I wrote to their customer relations to ask for compensation (for my delay baggage) all they offer is their ""sincere apology"" and no information regarding how they should compensate me for the costs incurred during the delayed baggage delivery.

The Business seating on European flights is always the same ... it's actually economy seating with the center seat unused, which I find poor for the money paid.

It's a credit to both crew and Lufthansa how these short flights are handled.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-18;" |  Frankfurt to Toronto. Boarding reasonably efficient but priority boarding hindered by crowding at the gate. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. These B747 aircraft are showing their age, and one problem is that the overhead bins in the first few rows are smaller than standard and don't fit the cabin baggage size limitations of LH. Food and presentation were ok. Seat was reasonably comfortable but entertainment system was lacking in choice and quality. A big problem this flight were 2 small children whose parents were not controlling well. They squealed, shouted and cried throughout the 8 hour flight and other passengers were quite upset. One guest intended to seek compensation as a result. Cabin crew were equally unimpressed but didn't seem to take action of any kind.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-16;" |  This was my first time flying Lufthansa, from Gothenburg to Prague, via the hub in Frankfurt. I was going to Prague on a Floorball cup with my team. The plane was over an hour late from Gothenburg, so we were worried not to catch the transfer in Frankfurt. The in-flight service was good, and for such a short flight, it was just the ordinary expected. a snack (consisting of a sandwich with mayonnaise and turkey meatloaf) and a drink. The crew was kind and helpful, they weren't irritated because of the delay and answered our questions. At the Frankfurt hub, the transfer waited for us at the gate, giving it somewhat of a delay, maybe 20 min's or so. The organisation of the hub was average, but the FRA airport is really large, so we had to run several kilometres from the arrival gate to the departure one. There didn't seem to be much organisation either, with gates lying far apart although the nearer gates were vacant. Overall I had a good experience though, even counting the delay. There were Wi-fi, but one had to pay for it, in three different levels of WiFi speed and amount, ranging from approximately 3€ up to 7€. Because I didn't buy the WiFi services, I can't rate them, but there were more than sufficient information on the subject.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-16;" | Munich to Incheon. Being German and a frequent flyer of Lufthansa I am very critical towards this airline. Lufthansa kept improving and catching up the last couple of years though. I think now they did it and my last experience was just outstanding as I flew Munich to Seoul with business class. The plane was a brand new A350-900. A mattress has been provided and a Pyjama that made the flight very comfortable. The entertainment was massively improved: at least twice as much movies and programs have been added to system, that contains interactive maps. Last but not least, and which is most important was the crew. The crew was not only very professional (which is state of the art @ Lufthansa) but attentive. Even though the level of Singapore Airlines or Emirates is not reached yet but the Lufthansa crew kept taking care of the passengers the whole flight. Lufthansa merits the 5 star rating if all flights would have the same level as I experienced during this one. To be improved is the seat though. It is too tight, too inclined and lacks of storage capacities and electronics connections. I heard that Lufthansa is working on that. Looking forward for it.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-16;" | Victoria-Vancouver-Frankfurt-Geneva on 24 April 2018, returning 10 May. Economy class booked through Lufthansa website, with advance seat selection. YVR-FRA 10-hour intercontinental segments were mainline LH flights using Boeing 747-400s. YYJ-YVR 20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. FRA-GVA 1¼-hour connecting flights were an A-319 and a CRJ-700. I customarily book in Lufthansa's Premium Economy, but their 747s have only four rows of seats and the only PE seats left were in the front bulkhead row, which aren't worth the cost. (In that front row, although you have extra knee room, you can't stretch out your legs fully because there are no seats in front of you.) As well, in the armrest you have not only the tray table but also the IFE screen, which is half the size of screens in other PE seats. So I booked regular economy class. My seats were 49A outbound and 48K on the return. Booking those window seats cost Can$49 each way and were worth it, as they let you stretch out your legs fully under the seat in front of you. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 90 minutes before landing. The meals were LH's two standard economy stodge options – vegetarian pasta or chicken. The second meal was an omelette before midday arrival at FRA, and beef stew or pasta before afternoon arrival at YVR. Connections as offered on LH website were tight, about two hours each way through FRA. Nevertheless, my luggage arrived with me both times. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone LH to ask for the Air Canada booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.";POSITIVE

The purser especially on the MUC-BUD route (LH 1682) was very caring, I asked him to give me something for my stomach to relieve my stomach ache, he brought me a very nice cognac, plus after a little while he brought me a herb-tea. I was like whao! The diabetic food for my wife was very good too, I can recommend to anyone to order for special meals on Business Class. There was some delay on the MUC-BUD route, but we could easily get over this, because of the service we got throughout the journey! And though we had little time, we visited the Lufthansa Business Lounge at MUC, and it was fabulous too, we visited half an hour before the closing-time of the lounge, and still there was enough warm food, and staff still refilled the sweets, and enough drink, bread, yoghurts, biscuits etc. The dark side: Wi-fi! I think it's quite ridiculous that such a big company like this, does not offer free wifi at least on Business Class!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-12;" |  Los Angeles to Malta via Munich last month, then back via Munich. Although Lufthansa's boarding procedures are wonky and our flight was late as a result, once on board Lufthansa, I never really have any complaints. The food is decent, drinks plentiful, and seats are about as comfortable (uncomfortable) as you would expect. Lots of in-flight entertainment options, which is good. The way back through Munich was a mess. For whatever reason we couldn't check in online. We called and were told we could check in at the airport the next morning at the airport to get our boarding passes, then do the same again once we were in Munich. This went OK for the first short flight, but horrible for the connection. The Lufthansa service desk in Munich wouldn't print our passes and sent us to the gate without alerting anyone. Lufthansa has an extra security check-in before the gate, and those employees didn't want to let us through without a boarding pass. This resulted in about twenty minutes of additional delay with three other confused Lufthansa employees. We finally made it to the gate where we were then reprimanded by another Lufthansa employee for being late for boarding. She refused to sit my husband and I together (?), so we were placed in separate aisles. Once on board the flight, the seat I had been given was in between a woman and her two children. She asked me to move, which I did. The row behind my husband's assigned seat was almost empty, so we ended up sitting there together. Essentially if you enjoy taking care of a bunch of customer service fails yourself, this is a great airline. Personally, I probably wouldn't fly Lufthansa again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-10;" |  Lufthansa CityLine uses this aircraft type frequently on the MUC-BRU route and others and it is to be avoided. The cabin is the most uncomfortable I´ve experienced, the seats are so narrow you have to squeeze yourself into them. Also, no business-class fast-lane security in MUC despite the fact that this is being advertised and included in the price for a business clas ticket. The quality of the food on this flight was rather sub-standard, announcements in German and English only, no French or Flemish. Cabin crew super friendly as usual with Lufthansa but they can´t make up for the substandard seating and other flaws. All in all, avoid Lufhansa CityLine and the Bombardier Regonal Jet if you can.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-09; |  Copenhagen to Munich. Lufthansa does not offer a fast lane at Copenhagen Airport for Business Class or star alliance Gold. That was quite inconvenient and the regular security took more than 20 minutes. SAS Lounge is not that good. Gate area old and dark and far a away. Flight on Lufthansa Cityline was uneventful. Crew was okay. No WiFi or entertainment. Considering that the flight was operated by a regional jet the seats were spacious and reclined. Verdict: good airline. CPH is not good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-08;" | I was travelling from QKL (Cologne Central Station) to CPH (Copenhagen) with Lufthansa via FRA (Frankfurt). The first leg of this trip was operated by Lufthansa Air Rail, which is a train service. While Miles&More Senators/HON and Lufthansa Business Class customers are allowed to use the DB Lounge at Cologne Central Station, this service is not provided to Star Alliance Gold customers. Still, I find the 50-minutes train ride from downtown Cologne to Frankfurt a very convenient alternative compared to flying. What I do not like is that there are no check-in agents at Cologne Station anymore – they have been replaced by a check-in machine. So it is not possible to make changes to the ticket: No change of flights, seats, frequent traveller card or APIS when flying to the US. Security at Frankfurt was very quick and I went directly to the lounge closest to my departure gate in the A terminal (A30). It was a business class lounge and had a really good selection of food and I nice tarmac view. It even had showers (which I did not use). I found it better that the Senator Lounges. The flight from FRA to CPH was fully booked in Economy, so no free middle seat. Nice crew, a bite to eat and two drink services (1h15m flight!). All in all a good experience. No obverhead screens or personal device entertainment available on this Lufthansa flight. WiFi was available for a charge. Verdict: Good flight, good airline. Would choose them again. Lufthansa should introduce personal device entertainment and check-in agents in Cologne.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-08;" |  Basel to Algiers via Frankfurt. I hardly see any value in buying a business cabin ticket with Lufthansa. There was a long bus transfers in Frankfurt airport and you need to travel in the same packed bus waiting until the last passenger is out of the plane. No free internet in the cabin, you need to pay same as a economy passenger. Seats the same and service not so different than the economy cabin. No priority boarding in practice, as they give priority to passengers with kids, which practically means almost half of the cabin so you need to wait in the tunnel to aircraft 10 minutes without A/C. It’s normally OK, but if you are paying 4 times the price for a business ticket you definitely expect a better service. No inflight entertainment also in the business cabin, no screens no videos.";NEGATIVE

The last two times I was quoted prices for my dogs and when I arrived at the airport the price was different. I have filed a claim and have had absolutely no satisfaction. When I calculate my travel I include the cost of the dog and my ticket purchase to determine which airline is most economical, this last trip the over charge was in excess of $500. I have friends that also travel to Europe with dogs and they were charge the amount I was quoted on the phone, so I don't understand why I was charged more. I have submitted to the claims department their payment document and mine to show the error, but still no response. LH has a problem with their Service center that needs to be address. I just spoke with someone a few minutes ago after a long hold period and was hung up on. I don't know what it takes for this airline to address my issues.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-07-04;" |  Athens to Hamburg via Munich, returning from Frankfurt in 0April. The food was mediocre to bad, the service was, overall (although there were a couple of notable exceptions), mechanical or indifferent (at best), sometimes bordering on downright rude. Once the food was served, on all 4 flights (with the partial exception of FRA-ATH), service was non-existent. We were not proactively offered anything (drink, etc) on flight ATH-MUC, the curtain between Business and Economy was left open for most of the flight, with the result that the Business class lavatory was used by people from Economy. None of the cabin crew tried to stop them. Surely one of the benefits of flying a Business class cabin is to have a dedicated bathroom? The boarding process was chaotic - any notion of priority boarding was a joke. On 1 flight by the time we boarded, other passengers had filled the storage space. Since we were seated at seats 2D and 2F, where we had no option but to store everything in the overhead lockers, I believe that someone should have made sure that people on the other rows stored things under the middle (empty) seats. To his credit, the steward very kindly helped us find a solution - no pre-flight drinks were offered, on one flight no menus were offered. We were offered a choice of ""meat"" or ""paella"".  Why should people pay the (significant) difference in price and travel Lufthansa Business, at least on flights within or close to Europe? ";NEGATIVE

After coming to the airport we are told that the flight leaves at 14.10!. No warning or message sent to me before. At the airport the staff was very unhelpful and was told to search for the Lufthansa counter and try and change the ticket. I did and queued for 2,5 hours. After that I managed to get on a Finnair flight with poor seating and poor service. No food voucher was given or no apologies and worst of all no Lufthansa staff helping or advising. Just queuing and poor service. And flight back was also delayed by 1,5 hours and extremely slow service on the counter with 1 person only working. What can I say...disappointed.";NEGATIVE

Beside the noise coming from A/C, no complaints about the flight conditions and service, the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile I could feel that customer satisfaction was the utmost priority and that the team was ready to fulfill all requests even if out of the ""standard protocol"". Transit in Frankfurt again a disaster due the security check. Early morning again 45 minutes as priority traveler in the fast lane. Frankfurt should take some consultancy of Brussels BRU airport, the security check goes much smother there. At 0530 all or most of shops still closed and I went to the LH lounge. Great lounge, super breakfast choices and staff. LH 1298 from FRA to IST was ready on time for departure and. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. No Gold Track for LH passenger at passport control, is for TK customers only. Priority Baggage delivery could be improved.";POSITIVE

Airbus A320 aircraft with standard LH economy seats, nothing special and not really comfortable for an 150 minutes flight. Service was OK, food tasty. No inflight entertainment! I had 75 minutes until my flight to Shanghai, which should have been plenty of time. I had to transfer from bus gate B to another gate Z within terminal 1 which was fine, it only took a few minutes. But then I got to security where there was a long queue ta “Fast Lane”. I spent 50 minutes as priority customer in the queue waiting to go through security. Only half the security lanes were open causing the long queues. Staff were slow, lazy and rude. I am a frequent Star Alliance Gold traveler and I have never experienced such delays, or incompetence at airport security. LH728 from FRA to PVG Shanghai Pudong. The gate side is much more comfortable and better organized than the check-in in IST. The flight was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The cabin cleanliness of the A380 aircraft was satisfactory. seats are comfortable and have generous recline for premium economy. On each seat was a plastic-wrapped blanket. a pair of plastic-wrapped, over-the-ear headphones. and a small pillow. The legroom is comfortable enough for sitting, but not enough for easily climbing over a sleeping seatmate — particularly when the seat in front is reclined. No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system as it appears to me that mainly old films are shown.";POSITIVE

The Premium Economy seats are comfortable: They offer more personal space, legroom and recline than standard economy seats, and I managed to get some rest on this red eyeflight. Unfortunately, Lufthansa only offered a choice between two meat dishes for dinner (same on the return). However, the service was very friendly and accommodating. The flight attendants went out of their way to organise a Vegetarian dish for me. The food that I got was very tasty and definitely above average for Economy (Lufthansa serves Economy meals in PE, even though they come on china plates). Happy to fly Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE

In Mar to April 2018 I decided to travel as a RT from YVR-FRA-IKA-FRA-YVR as I went to visit my family, by Lufthansa and in return/the way back. when I get to Frankfurt they announced after 4 hours delay that the flight from Frankfurt to Vancouver has been canceled, so all passengers had to get the next flight which was not until the next 14 hours, as I do not have a Schengen Visa to get a hotel in the city/Frankfurt, I had to stay in the airport the whole evening and all night long to get the next flight for 8:30 AM. They gave me a tiny thin blanket and I had to sleep on the cold metal chair which was the only object to sleep at the whole time and had to try to be awake for half of the time to keep my eyes on my baggage, so no one can steal any of my stuff. Its obviously not true that the airport doesn't have any room for passengers who their flight get canceled. I was so frustrated and I had to be at work the next day but what Ive got instead was a very poor customer service reps and no one was around who could be responsible or at least give some solutions! No one helped me regarding to that issue, anywhere I went to ask for help were so very unreasonable and couldn't give me any convenient answer!  I do not recommend anyone to fly with this airline!";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-28;" |  Houston to Moscow via Frankfurt. Worst A380 layout I have flown. LH management should compare layouts of Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, Korean, Thai, or even the 777's of EVA, ANA, Asiana etc. All are superior. Have not flown LH since my last Business class A380 experience a few years ago. Seats did not lay flat, so you constantly had to push yourself up from the foot rest. Fell victim to advertising that the new seats lay 180 degree flat, but I won't return. LH uses a 2x2x2 layout, rather than a far superior 1x2x1 of other5 Star Airlines. EVA & others offer 1x2x1 on their 777's. Seats on the LH A380 are the most narrow of any A380 I've flown. Tiny foot space. No privacy dividers between seats, unlike most 5 Star airlines, so it is a crowded feeling. Seats are low back, so you can view the TV screens of every other passenger if you are in the rear of business class. Very distracting. Do not understand why LH consistently fails to select high quality seating? Seat controls are on top of the arm rests, so if you lower your seat to sleep, you must crawl ""up out of the hole"" to make adjustments. Who thought this was a good design feature? Inflight personnel offer professional service, but are let-down by poor catering & cleaning. On the IAH/FRA segment I was seated in 2nd row of Business & 3rd row on the FRA/IAH return, yet on both flights there was NO entrée selection when the flight attendant came to take the meal orders. Catering had apparently failed to properly cater the flight in both directions, so there was zero meal selection. You just had to take whatever they had boarded. The printed menu is another joke. There is NO consistency to LH's printed menu, & the food you may receive. On the FRA/IAH segment the menu listed ""traditional Italian ice creams"". What was served was yogurt with granola. Is this another mistake by catering? The cleaning crew in Frankfurt could use updated training. Side business class storage compartments were filled with assorted trash. LH has also totally given up on any pretense of offering a quality amenity bag. Worst of any business class flight I have flown. Also agree with several other reviews that LH should be sued for ""false advertising"" regarding their non-existent business class service on many shorter routes. On many routes their business class is nothing more than the same seating in coach - 3 across with the middle seat being unoccupied. No added leg-room or amenities. The LH Business class lounge at FRA is mediocre at best. For breakfast there were no pastries offered. Just some powdered eggs, selection of cold cuts & cheese, & some cold hard bread. This is LH's top offering to Business class passengers? Wewill stay with Asian & Middle Eastern Airlines for our long haul International travel whenever possible. I will say LH is better than UA, AA & DL, but that is nothing to brag about. At least the flight crew kept the bathroom clean & tidy. Waited 40 minutes for our bags upon IAH arrival. Apparently ""priority"" bag tags have no meaning at LH. 2 flights were 3+ weeks apart, but entertainment was identical in both directions.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-28;" |  Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. One of the worst customer service you will experience. Myself and my 15 month old daughter are traveling from Detroit to Chennai via Frankfurt. When we reached the airport, they checked in the bag and when they checked the passport, they found that my wife cannot travel as there is a new rule that if you have a layover in Frankfurt, we need a valid schengen visa or a US stamped visa. We told Lufthansa that you never told us anything while booking the tickets or even when i called them to pay for the seat allotment as Lufthansa charges person for getting the bassinet seat (Most other airlines provide it free if you book the flight with infant). Lufthansa just want to get the money from you and never provide any information. The person at the check in counter said it is in our website and i asked him to show it, he went and wandered for 15 minutes and said he lost the sheet which had that information. I checked their website and nothing says about the rule. They mention that if you have two layover within Europe you need schengen visa, but not for a single layover within Frankfurt. And the person in the counter said, if you have booked the ticket through Lufthansa, the customer service should provide me alternate route. So, i called the customer service as i booked the flight through Lufthansa.com. When i called Lufthansa customer service, they told me that they cannot do anything apart from cancelling (which i dont get any refund) or postpone the flight to some other day so that i can go and get schengen visa. I am speaking to them saying getting schengen visa takes days and my wife and daughter has to travel within couple of days. The customer service person said they cannot do anything. So, i went back to the check in counter and the person over there called the supervisor who made a call to customer service of Lufthansa and explained the situation. Lufthansa finally said they can put us in another flight with a huge layover everywhere and also it cost us $1500 more as it is considered as one way flight and we need to pay from our pocket. I have been going through all this mess in the airport and took almost 4 hours with the 15 month old baby sitting in the airport. I decided not to fly with Lufthansa as they treated really really bad and went to Qatar Airways and flew with them, who provided excellent care for the baby and myself. But Lufthansa didnt stop there, they charged me extra for missing the flight and also charged me more as my return flight is with Lufthansa. So, i ended by paying more than $3500 for the entire flight from Detroit to Chennai and my return flight. The person in the check in counter said, they see same scenario everyday (at least 2 people every day). Lufthansa is  making free money from 2 people at just one airport and i am imagining how much money they make from all the airport around the world. They charge people when they knew that they cannot fly and also charge them more whey they miss the flight due to Lufthansa mistake. While booking the ticket, why cannot Lufthansa mention this. Lufthansa mention that you need to have a valid schengen visa is there is multiple layover within Europe. If you can say that, why cannot Lufthansa say that if you don't have a valid US visa or a Schengen visa you cannot have a layover in Frankfurt. Lufthansa just want to get the money out of you and don't care about their customer. Their customer service is the worst i have ever dealt with.";NEGATIVE

When I purchased the ticket, there were flights with either about 45 minute connection time or about 3.5 hour connection time at Munich / Frankfurt airport. 3.5 hour seemed quite long so I chose connecting flights with 45 minute layover. If Lufthansa sells the tickets, the transfer should be possible. In fact, I had less than 30 minutes to transfer as the boarding for the 2nd flight closed 15 minutes prior to the departure. When my first flight arrived in Munich, I had to run. But there were so many people in the queue to go through the security and then passport control. It would take more than an hour or two to get to the gate! But then I realised from the live departure board that my flight to London has departed. As that was Lufthansa's last flight to London on that day, I had to wait until the next day to fly back. There was a long queue at Lufthansa's service centre as well. They arranged a hotel for me to stay near the airport with taxi vouchers. The airport hotel didn't turn out to be so near the airport and the taxi driver was horrible to me. There was a hotel at the airport, Lufthansa should have arranged a room for me there. They should not sell connecting flights with such unrealistic layover time. I tried to complain to Lufthansa, however, their website didn't allow me to do so. So I emailed their customer service. They acknowledged the receipt but I haven't heard from them since then.

lufthansa;2018-06-25;" |  Dublin to Munich is a short flight but Lufthansa still serve food and drink for free unlike many European airlines. Transfer in Munich was straightforward as it was well-signposted to the train to transfer between different terminals. Munich to Hong Kong was my first time on an A380. I was excited to experience a new airplane so I booked a seat on the upper deck. Unfortunately the seat I booked was in a row of three behind a row of four so that when sitting I faced the gap between the two seats in front of me and had to sit at an angle in the seat to view my entertainment screen. Otherwise though the flight was very good. We were served dinner shortly after take-off, breakfast in the morning and a snack before landing. The food was all decent airline food. There was a good selection of films in a variety of languages and plenty of other entertainment features to keep me occupied. Crew were polite and efficient without being particularly friendly. Flight departed and arrived on time.";POSITIVE

A two-hour delay for which there was just a lukewarm excuse. The meal consisted of a tiny package with hard chips - after the unexpected waiting time at Tegel airport in the evening hours not really satisfactory. The crew seemed hurried and mostly interested in their free time after work. Altogether much room for improvement.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2018-06-21;" |  Frankfurt to Florence. Everything was ruined by Lufthansa. We have arrived to Frankfurt airport, check in, passed security control, and we waiting for boarding. 15 minutes before flight they said that flight is canceled and we have to go to a counter. We went to counter. There was long queue. It was approximately 20 flights canceled, due to bad weather. So after 1.5 hour in the queue we have reached counter. Staff was quite rude, they told us to go to another counter in departure area. We went there. There was several times longer queue. Here we spent approximately 5 hours prior to reaching counter. Here staff was more friendly. They put us on waiting list for 8 a.m. flight and give vouchers to hotel. Next morning we have repeated exercise. In boarding area they told us that it is 40 people on waiting list and only two seats, so we have to go back to counter. I ask, is it possible to talk with manager. Answer was quite rude: go to counter and there will be your manager. We run to counter. This time we reach it in 40 minutes. They rebook us on waiting list of 11:50 flight and told us that at noon air dispatchers strike in Italy will start. There I realized that we may reach Florence by some miracle this evening, otherwise we may not get there even till our train to Verona. We decided to change plans and cancel our flights to Florence and from Verona. They told us that we have to go to different counter on second floor. Another hour waiting and we are again in front of window. They told us that here we can only cancel flight, but to start procedure of returning money I have to go to site and feel up some request. They told us that we may get our luggage in half an hour to one hour. Of cause, it took us 2.5 hours to get it. Mean while I feel up that form. It was not from the first attempt that I was able to submit it. To summarize our experience: of cause there could be different circumstances, like weather conditions, strike etc., but it would be good attitude to send manager to each canceled flight area and talk with passengers, figure out their needs, try to find some solutions. Nothing of this was done. In addition to that normal companies did not canceling flights due to temporary weather conditions, just postponing it. And for sure making client wait hours in queue and kicking them from one counter to another just because managers don’t want to look for a solution is extremely bad attitude. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-20;" |  Lufthansa does not have flights between Cologne and Frankfurt but offers a service that is operated by Deutsche Bahn (train service). While there used to be a staffed check-in counter at the train station, it was replaced a couple years ago by a self check-in. That means there is no agent anymore and flights cannot be changed. I find that disappointing. The service itself is good because the train station is in downtown cologne (and the airport isn´t) and the trains are punctual. Lufthansa is using a dedicated train car, but no food or drinks are offered in economy class on this 1-hour train ride. Wifi and personal device streaming are free of charge. After all I am quite happy with this service and using it frequently.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-18;" |  Lufthansa pushed the times of my original flight back by 6 hours, just a couple of months prior which is out of line considering their no refund policy and high rebooking fee. With no alternative flights available in the company to fit in with my already booked itinerary, the call centre staff cancelled the booking with promise of a full refund of 412 euros within 14 business days. They emailed confirmation of cancellation without any acknowledgement of the refund in writing. 6 weeks, 6 phone calls and an email inquiry later, I am still waiting. It took over a week for someone to respond to my urgent inquiry, with a generic, unhelpful response. The call centre staff have been completely unwilling to take my situation seriously and don't seem to understand the aspect of holding onto funds for which they are not providing a service. I have been continuously advised that they are unable to provide written confirmation of the refund, that I am unable to speak to the refunds department directly and tell me it has been processed, and to keep checking my bank account.

lufthansa;2018-06-13;" |  Los Angeles to Amsterdam via Frankfurt. The 747-8 is an interesting plane to fly, it's new and a classic at the same time. Unfortunately flying it in economy is just awful. I was seated in row 16, the first row of a mini cabin between club and premium economy, where seats are sold at premium prices. The seats are cramped and ergonomically wrong, not a chance to get comfortable. IFE could be good but malfunctioned in about every way it could, so gave up on that. The insult after injury was the main meal: a tinfoil container half filled with a mix of overcooked macaroni with mayo! The German kitchen is not known for its delicacies but this was simply terrible. Tasted like a mix of metal and nothing. A passenger was apparently smoking-where and when it is of course not allowed - but to wake up 400+ passengers with an incomprehensible long and loud rant by the lead FA in the middle of the night was not appreciated or professional. Also bags did not make the flight and although Lufthansa keeps emailing you on every element of the trip (like gate changes), they didn't bother to inform us our bags were never loaded in LAX, why? Needless to say we were not too impressed by Lufthansa and consider this flight and airline as bad as it can get these days";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-13;" |  Paid $10,000+ for first class Washington to Istanbul via Frankfurt. Flights there via Frankfurt were fine. Decided to return a couple days early so called to change flights. At this point the service went from good to horrible. First you call 800-645-3880 and prepare for half hour minimum call (once I was cut off after hold). I explained just wanted to move up the Istanbul to Frankfurt segment couple days. Again a long hold the agent says no problem same fare. But I will need to pay $1,500 in taxes.  I ask for explanation and none given. I then for cost to cancel the entire return trip and it is $900. This made no sense so I decided to go to the airport to talk to a human being face to face. Lufthansa has their Istanbul airport office and I get some service counter agent who basically has to call and hold just like I did from hotel. Another 20 minutes to be told to change the Istanbul segment would be $2,400! If I were to purchase a business class ticket today from Istanbul to Frankfurt it is $350? So why $2,400? No explanation from anyone. I am calling again now and holding. 20 minutes get an agent who will check and again 30 minutes and still holding. I will never fly Lufthansa again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-12;" | This is my 3rd bad experience with Lufthansa in the last 3 months and I think I need to share it. I was travelling Business Class from Zagreb to Frankfurt and then to London with a layover in FRA of 1hr 45min. Boarding at ZAG was done without priority boarding. When landing at FRA the pilot lost his way around the airport and took about 20 minutes to park at a remote stand. Not only no separate bus was used for C class passengers, but instead all passengers were squeezed like sardines into one single bus. When I reached Terminal A I had to walk for over a mile and take a train to make it to gates B where my flight for LHR was departing from. I have never before had to go through security again during a transfer when travelling within Europe, yet Lufthansa decided to send me through a route that required security screening again. The queue for the security was one of the longest I have ever seen in my life. As a business class passenger and Star Alliance Gold member I attempted to enter the Fast Track. A lady standing at the entrance refused entrance to me saying just ""No"", despite me showing her my C class boarding pass and my gold star alliance card. I asked her three times whether Lufthansa does not allow passengers to use fast track any more and she kept telling me one single word, ""No"". I waited in the normal security queue for 40 minutes and that left me no single minute for lounge access. When I reached the gate, boarding just started and no priority boarding was used again. The Lufthansa agent just opened the gate and said ""please go"" and all passengers just run towards the plane. There are not a lot of benefits for business class European flights. People pay a significant additional amount of money to get a couple of extra benefits which it appears that Lufthansa refuses for no specific reason. What should have been a comfortable layover turned out to be a nightmare for me and a gap of nearly 2hrs between the flights disappeared. I have experienced inconsistent and bad service from Lufthansa both on the ground and in the air in another two occasions recently and this is enough for me to say that I would not recommend this airline to anyone and certainly don't waste your money to pay for business class because it is questionable whether you will receive any of the benefits at all.";NEGATIVE

When we were told that we could get a meal voucher because we were re-booked to the next days flight, we were redirected by Lufthansa staff to different counters 4 times.

lufthansa;2018-06-10;" |  London to Munich. I prefer Lufthansa because they have a good onboard service and a friendly crew: On this short flight I was served a cup of water, a cup of white wine and was given a sandwich. The sandwich was not a full meal but a good light snack in the evening. The departure terminal was T2A which is brand new and very convenient. Arrival terminal in Munich was T2, which also is  convenient and more comfortable than the old T1. I had a seat in the emergency exit row which can be reserved in advance by paying a fee or for free during web check-in. I had one trolley suitcase and a notebook bag. The flight was delayed due to bad weather in Germany but we were well informed. In Munich, I saw that some connecting passengers were picked up by gate agents. I recommend Lufthansa.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-08;" |  One of the best airlines I have flown. I started my journey in Seattle and travelled to Zurich via Frankfurt, Germany. I had flown with them a couple of times before, all positive experiences, and I was looking up to my flights. The ground staff were excellent, although I was a little disappointed to find out that Seattle Airport doesn’t offer any bag wrapping options. The ground staff was very friendly and helpful. After I checked in my bag, I headed to the lounge. Although it was crowded and not Lufthansa’s own lounge, it was a great lounge. The seats were very comfy, WI-FI was fast, food was good, and the staff was very friendly. Boarding started on time and in the correct order. Boarding went very smooth, and as soon as I boarded, I was welcomed to the purser. The food was great and seat very comfortable. I slept great and enjoyed my meals. Lufthansa’s staff is outstanding. A man sitting next to me was very inpatient and kept complain about the fact that the person behind him got his meal first even though he had a higher status. I would have already stopped serving, but the crew kept smiling and putting up with his moaning. My flight was great and I would definitely recommend it. After I landed in Frankfurt, I had a 4 hour layover until my connection to Zurich, but it went great and very smooth. As I was very tired, I headed to the lounge to rest, but after the lounge staff saw I was almost sleeping in my seat, they offered me a bedroom with a shower. The bed was perfect and the room looked like a 4-star hotel. The shower was outstanding and I was impressed with the service. After my rest, I headed to my connecting flight to Zurich. This flight also went very smooth and the food was great. After I landed, I accidentally forgot my iPhone on the plane, but before I had even noticed I left it, the flight attendant came running through the terminal to give it to me, I was amazed. My bag was the first one to come out in the baggage claim, which was very nice. Overall, I would definitely recommend Lufthansa.";POSITIVE

First there was an Aperitif and nuts. Then a very nice, multi-page menu with the topic asparagus season was distributed. From this one could choose between three different main courses. Our chosen main course, the appetizer, the salad and the dessert were very delicious. After lunch we got a bar of bourbon vanilla chocolate (50 grams) from the Dominican Republic. The selection of drinks was very good and the crew served all the drinks until just before landing. Five Stars! We will gladly to take this great service again.";POSITIVE

My Lufthansa flight from Barcelona to Frankfurt in May was delayed and I was not able to take the connecting Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Houston on my pre-booked Premium Economy class. Lufthansa asked me to change the flight and rebooked me other flight with economy class. I had no choice but took it. By doing that, I lost the privilege of the services of Premium Economy and reduced flyer program points. I purchased the more expensive Premium Economy ticket with Lufthansa and was downgraded to a less expensive economy class. After the trip, I contacted Lufthansa and they refused any compensation associated with this trip. This is an extremely bad experience with Lufthansa.  It is not worth the money to purchase Premium Economy Class since you spend the money but you may not be able to have the services of Premium Economy Class when there is a delay in flight that is not your fault.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-03;" |  Frankfurt to Athens. Staff at Gate was very friendly and helpful. Also the cabin crew worked fast and was very friendly. Unfortunately this aircraft was not prepared for Lufthansa Inflight Entertainment like the most aircrafts of Lufhansa, so it was not possible to use the Lufthansa App that provides several entertainment options. I am really disappointed about the seats. The seat was too thin and too short. All Lufthansa singlle aisle aircrafts have this type of seats. This was not a pleasure as the flight take 2 hours and 30 minutes and I had some pain at the lower back area and thigs. I guess for a shorter flight the seat is ok, but for flight of more than 2 hours it can be very unconfotable to sit on such a seat. The menu/food was ok, the tast more bland than nice. I expect more from a 5 star airline, especaially in business class! There was only one choise of coffee, filter coffee. No further coffees available like espresso or cappuccino other airlines offer in business class and same typ of aircraft, single aisle. And the service has been done with foof and beverages trollies, this is fine but at some shorter flights within Europe Lufthansa has a signature service. I just do not understand when the principle when do they offer signature service and when the service is with trollies. However both are good for me. In general I would always recommend Lufthansa but the value of money for business class should be significantly better.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-06-03; |  Houston to Athens via Frankfurt. My experience was horrible. They cancelled our international flight from Houston to Frankfurt 45 minutes before boarding time. Their cancellation caused us so many consequential damages costs. We contacted them explaining the situation  but they said they were not willing to pay for our consequential costs. They did not offer a voucher as a sign of apology or compassion.  A total chaos in the gate as well. They did not make any announcement for the cancellation and we had to be notified by expedia through a text message. Ground staff was horrible in helping people booking the next available flight (we had to fly the next day). ;NEGATIVE

Upon arrival in Frankfurt, I went to the Service Center for rebooking. 20 minutes waiting time. The staff who took my case was friendly and efficient. Lufthansa paid for a meal, taxi, and hotel to spend the night in Frankfurt. They let me pick my replacement flight. The hotel was very nice. Replacement flight departed late but landed on time. Return flight to Frankfurt departed 30 minutes late. Connecting flight was 2 hours late (lots of delays in Frankfurt that day). Our gate got changed twice. Ground staff was relaxed and friendly. I got informed of the delays and the cancellation by email and SMS. However the website made it hard to track delays and gate changes. Seats and IFE's (or lack thereof) were as good as it gets for European short hauls. I also found out 3 flight out of 4 had in flight wifi, which is nice.

We were delayed 15 minutes at departure, but we recovered the time in-flight and landed several minutes early. The flight attendant serving our part of the cabin was efficient, proactive, and friendly. The dinner served was elaborate and delicious. The veal and asparagus would have presented a challenge if we had been using plastic cutlery, but silverware did the job handily. I remember feeling that the seat was somewhat narrow in the flat-bed configuration, but I promptly dozed off and slept soundly for five hours. I must have been mistaken about the seat. With all the horror stories about lost luggage published here on Skytrax, I was apprehensive about my suitcase double connecting in Newark and Munich, but Lufthansa (and United) did their job and my case arrived promptly and intact. I had made a special request of Lufthansa by mail ahead of the flight. All correspondence was handled courteously and professionally. Many reviewers here tell bitter tales of frustration dealing with the customer service departments of other airlines, but I could not be more pleased with how LH handled my request. I have read a number of comments questioning whether Lufthansa deserves to be on the Skytrax 5 star list. In my experience and opinion it is a well-deserved honor.";POSITIVE

Cabin crew introduced herself to me (bad sign) and kindly forewarned me that as I was in seat 1C, there would be a bassinet in front of me, and offered me a choice of seat change. Eventually was in Seat 7D. The A350-900 version 1 by LH has 2 business class cabins, the one most fore is a self-enclosed area bounded by the toilets and galley in the rear, but this area has bassinet fixing positions. The second area is aft of the toilets and galley and separated by a partition from the premium economy section, this area has less seats but you are more likely to be bothered by toilet and galley noise, if that is important. This area does not have bassinet fixing positions. The modern seat was as efficient and high-tech as before, really simple to adjust your seat to achieve a variety of positions including lie flat. Service was more friendly this time, though also with a Germanic reserve (none the worse for that!). Dinner was served shortly after departure, and was pleasant enough fare. Overall cabin ambience was good enough to achieve a fairly comfortable sleep, and awoke for breakfast - which was really not deserving of the term, it was the first time I ever managed not to eat scrambled eggs and cheese at 40,000 feet! The only other slight criticism is that the toilets were quite heavily used in business class and were showing signs of definite disorder by the time we were approaching our destination. Overall, a comfortable and plush flight in the very quite A350, marred only by a couple of small points.";POSITIVE

Then when I noticed my partner surname was incorrectly recorded, I was advised by their telephone customer services to cancel and rebook, which I did at an additional cost of £400, but again because it was within the first 24 hours, I should have received a full refund (there are still errors recorded in this second booking). After a few weeks I received only £241 of the £528 in 13 small payments, and still await the balance of £328 some 7 weeks of first booking/cancellation. Despite many phone calls to their customer service operators who all promise me the refund within 5 days it does not arrive, but some have insisted all the money had been paid back, or that the total is less than I say it is, yet they are unable to discuss matters further. One even asked me to submit my bank statement to prove that I was underpaid which I emailed to no avail. They refuse to give me contact details of their Ticketing Section, so I am very frustrated. Their online customer services logging system should reply within ""five days"" but my enquiry about the delay and also my follow-up complaint have only been acknowledged but have never been responded to, despite my weekly emailed prompts to them. They complain of repeated queries slowing up their system, but this is their own fault for not dealing more quickly - how much extra money are they spending on their phone services that would have been avoided if customers had been dealt with earlier.";NEGATIVE

When I boarded the plane my seat was taken with no real explanation and I was told I could not sit there and the Luftansa staff member was unsympathetic towards my need to be in a comfortable aisle seat.

Her return flight from Manchester was at 9.20 am which would give me plenty of time to get to the airport. After the ticket purchase the return flight changed to 6.15 am which made me to spend an extra £130 to stay at an airport hotel. The flight change in Frankfurt to Kiev was 50 minutes. The plane set off from Manchester 54 minutes late so my mum missed the flight at Frankfurt as she did not have enough time for the flight change. I also booked a wheel chair assistance for her. Nobody collected her from the plane in Frankfurt as it was promised by Lufthansa. It took ages for her to find the gate at Frankfurt to Kiev and it was one of the reasons why she missed flight to Kiev. At Frankfurt she had to wait 12 hours before she was given a seat to Kiev. The gate at Frankfurt to Kiev was changed just before the boarding. She arrived to Kiev 12 hours later than expected and wasted the money for her train ticket from Kiev as she missed it too. The whole journey was a disaster. I will avoid them forever.;NEGATIVE

There is 1 responsible FA for the cabin. At this flight it was a very gentle and friendly  staff who took care of passenger and had a very great attention. The dinner was very delicious and several drink services before and after the food was served. Before our landing in SIN they serve typical Economy breakfast. Since the arrival in SIN is 5pm local time I can’t really understand why they not serve just an quick snack instead of a breakfast. The entertainment program of LH is good.

lufthansa;2018-04-29;" | Business class on A321 service from Munich to Madrid. Departure was delayed due to a faulty coffee machine, of all things, but was impressed with the efficient gate change and marginal delay, even after they had to identify an alternative aeroplane. In the end, delayed by about 30 mins. Boarding was free-for-all, given the delay, but still relatively pleasant. Business seating on this flight was exactly the same as economy, except for the fact that the centre seat is left empty with a ""seat-filler"", that allows you to ""share"" the empty seat space with your other seating partner as a table-rest. Legroom also felt pretty much the same as economy. There was no IFE, other than ""pay-for-service"" wifi, if you wished. The differentiation is the food, obviously - as we were served a full breakfast on this 2 hour hop, with the food being even better than the business class breakfast served on the long-haul LH flight. Service was prompt and friendly. Nonetheless, given the price differential, I'm not sure I would part with my own hard-earned cash for business class flights solely for priority boarding and better food.";POSITIVE

All in all, it was a very good flight with an excellent crew.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-04-23;" |  Singapore to Munich on A350-900. Seating in business class was 2-2-2 configuration. First impression was that of spaciousness, because of the high ceiling (high mounted luggage compartments). The seats have electronic adjustment of virtually all parameters, including chair softness. AKG noise cancelling headphones, and adjustable IFE screen. Slight criticisms - the pockets for placing items were not very large, for example, difficult to fit in an iPad, and not many clever storage crannies. Service throughout was efficient but lacking the warmth and friendliness of Asian airlines. Food for dinner was served on departure and the menu looked good. Breakfast before arrival was less impressive. but edible nonetheless. Reclining seats were very easy to manage. sleeping horizontal was slightly less comfortable than expected because cushions were a little firm. Overall was a comfortable business class flight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-04-22; |  Frankfurt to Budapest return. A group of ten party guys were screaming the whole flight. Cabin crew did their best to calm down the situation which was highly appreciated. Nevertheless atmosphere on board was terrible. Return flight was enjoyable with good Lufthansa service as usual. Only the approach to Frankfurt airport was turbulent. Both flights were delayed by 30-45 minutes. Lufthansa should work on their on-time performance. On a positive side there was free catering with a tasty sandwich and full bar service.;POSITIVE

Don't understand why people complain about the normal seats on Lufthansa's short range flights - this is standard among virtually all_European airlines. We were travelling with our daughter of 2 years on a vacation trip. The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight. Service and food onboard were professional and friendly. The surcharge when booking a non flexible business class ticket compared to the available economy tickets was well worth the benefits. Will definitely book Lufthansa BC again next year.";POSITIVE

The long haul part from Frankfurt to Seoul was on the A340-600. On the positives it was a large airplane with comfortable seats very good infotainment system and friendly service. The food I found medium quality and disappointing that they gave us no amenity kit with socks, mask, toothbrush/paste as many other good airlines do so. All in all a mediocre experience and definitely not 5 star.";POSITIVE

I will never take or recommend this airline.";NEGATIVE

The ground services at a few Germans airports planned a strike on 10.04.2018. The Airline surely need to be aware of in advance. It did not stop them, however, to wait until the very last minute to inform customers on effects this action was going to take on flight delays or cancelations that day. It caused the website and telephone lines to crush down so we were not able to rebook our flights straight away.

Both legs of my friends flights, who were going on to Washington DC had also been cancelled). I had a long layover in Munich and was limping from a bad knee. The representative at Munich customer service rebooked me in a bulkhead seat and then had me driven to the departing terminal to a special service center for the disabled or injured. There were two curtained off rooms with beds as well as recliners and a disabled bathroom with shower. When it came time to leave I was driven to the plane.

The lady at the desk forgot to ""transfer"" the Lufthansa ticket to United (Denver - Los Angeles), once at Denver airport, the United flight was also delayed, 6h, just 1h before boarding we were called to the frontdesk to let us know we couldn't board the plane to LA as Lufthansa hadn't ""transfer"" the e-ticket to United. We called to Lufthansa (so did 2 United ground personal) and Lufthansa staff didn't believe any of us, not even the United personal, according to Lufthansa system we were already in LA and not in Denver. We had to stay 1 night in Denver, we were told the next day we would have our new tickets, nothing in the morning, we called again Lufthansa, 45 minutes waiting and finally got to speak with an agent who couldn't believe it and we had to explain all again. We finally got some kind of ticket and we could check our selves in United website. We arrived 24hrs later to LA. Nearly 1 month after the trip, Lufthansa has only sent the automatically email ""thank for your email"" and nothing more. I have never had such a terrible experience. No more Lufthansa for us, we always booked Lufthansa to USA/Canada even when Air France/Klm, British Airways have cheaper fares than Lufthansa. Very sad experience specially cause none of Lufthansa seemed to care about what we always had to explain and none believed us nor the United personal at Denver airport. Very poor customer service.";NEGATIVE

Despite a announced Air Traffic controllers strike at Marseille, Lufthansa boarded passengers and then asked them to step out, collecting their bags promising that they will be directed to their destination by other LH flights. A message reached each passanger's phone or email address. However there was not any info from the Airline for potential air controllers strike. despite they were also selling tickets for flights as if there was no any strike alert. I had to cancel my reservation to their proposed replacement flight (that was the next day, April 8th) and proceed by road to  Genoa airport as there were no alternative from Marseille by Lufthansa. Alert had been issued on March 28th 2018 that the strike would start on April 7th at 06:00 LT. Indeed my flight was suppose to take off on April 7th, 2018 at 08:50. During bags drop-off at LH desk none was inform me for the alert and the potential strike. Only after strike commenced a notice was displayed on one of LH screens. LH ticketing was issuing tickets from Marseilles airport even during the strike time. Assuming that I would have stayed to fly with next day's LH flights I would have pay my Hotel since LH was not liable for the strike of air controllers. Any apology can not be accepted. ";NEGATIVE

Even the A340-300 was a little bit older seats were good and space was ok for economy. Service was above standard. Several drinks were provided. If you take a seat in row 30 or behind the galley in the back is not far and you can walk in just like a bar and can ask for every drink you wish. Food on flight to Mauritius was very good above standard food on other airlines, on the flight back unfortunately it was not that good maybe because to destination. Flight entertainment was great but think about bring your own noise canceling headphone with you. As a seat i can recomend row 32-36 at the window very quiet";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-04-04;" | For our city trip to Singapore from Frankfurt we decided to fly with Lufthansa. The Boarding in Frankfurt was a little bit chaotic as all Economy passengers boarded at the same time. In Singapore it was done by row which was much better. The plane itself was okay. The meals were also good but only good. There are airlines with better meals in economy but also others with meals which are not as good as the meals with Lufthansa. The Seats we had, 96k and 96h on the upper deck were worth the money as it was pretty quiet and the service offered by the crew was great. The most dissapointing thing was the inflight entertainment system which seems to be a bit old and slow. Also the selection of music and films compared to other airlines was not very good. It was enough to survive the 12 hours flight but not as good as expected. Overall I would choose Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE

The flight attendant gave me the menu, but didn't say a word or even smile or make eye contact. She then took the menu out of my hand without saying a word to me. Just kept on chatting with her colleague but didn’t bother to say “excuse me, can I have the menu back” and give some sort of explanation. At Munich Airport I tried to confirm with someone from the Lufthansa staff if my gate had changed and she replied I could have a look at the information on the board, for myself. I was polite and friendly andI’m used to have the same treatment in return. But in this case that just didn’t happen.";NEGATIVE

Pleased that Lufthansa has the good grace to serve complementary snack and drinks even on short European flights.

Based on my experience today I’m very pleased that I have flights booked with this airline later in the year.;POSITIVE

As I am Star Alliance Gold I used the SEN lounge in Dubai - LH offers a consistent lounge product but food & beverages are very average in Dubai- if at all. At least the lounge is nicely furnished. Boarding was quick and the ""Old Lady 747"" was full in business. The seat is comfortable - but it offers no/limited privacy and on the lower deck it has an outdated 2-3-2 configuration - can it get any worse? Their sister airlines Swiss and Austrian offer a much better layout already. Anyhow I got a good sleep for almost 5h as the seat converts in a fully flat bed. I waived the late dinner and had only the breakfast - unfortunately nothing to remember. The inflight entertainment is technically advanced - the selection on music is the worst from all airlines I have flown. The movies though are OK. Overall the experience is OK - but far away from 5 star.";POSITIVE

Exceptional service. 4 Star Alliance Lounges in LHR Terminal 2 to choose from, the best being Air Canada to have good food an have a good shower if you have time. The boarding process was very easy for priority boarding, did not wait even one second. On board the food was very nicely presented and of great quality for a barely 1 hour long flight, so perfect marks for the catering. The Cabin Crew were also very presentable, cheery and professional. The transit experience was also easy in Munich airport, and the lounge there was nice, airy, and quiet. Luggage came out quickly after landing. All in all perfect service from one of the best European Airlines.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-03-27;" |  Tokyo to Buenos Aires via Frankfurt, the trip from Tokyo to Frankfurt was very good, the staff experienced and respectful. My big disappointment occurred while flying from Frankfurt to Buenos Aires. I asked the stewardess to help me In order to put a backpack in the luggage rack as I was holding my baby and she refused to help me, I had to ask for help from another passenger. I also requested services from the staff and the person assigned to the area pretended not to see or hear the passengers' calls. When I was getting my return flight from Buenos Aires to Tokyo, the flight was canceled and rescheduled, we had to wait around seven hours. Someone from Lufthansa staff in Buenos Aires did not want to inform us about the arrival times to our destination. I was assigned a second flight from Frankfurt to Tokyo with only one hour difference, I was not informed that I would travel with another airline and they did not confirm whether I would be given seats with a crib for my baby (I had paid for this seat as flying from Buenos Aires to Tokyo can easily take more than 30 hours). I asked the staff to confirm this information, but she told me that everything was indicated on the ticket, which was not the case since it did not indicate the local time of arrival to Tokyo, so I had to request the information from another staff. Finally, the flight took off later than the scheduled time expected so I was afraid that I could not connect flights on time. In Frankfurt, you can experience some delay while making flight connections. No one from the airline assisted us even though we had less than forty minutes to get to the second flight, due to the flight delay. Luckily, some security from the airport gave us a priority in the security line because otherwise we would not have arrived on time. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-03-19;" |  Tel Aviv to Munich. Lufthansa has to think about their boarding procedures in Tel Aviv. We waited 25 minutes for boarding and it took us a long time to get all passengers inside the A321, so we left Tel Aviv with about 30 minutes delay. The cabin staff were kind of stressed and unfriendly, due to a group of passengers who stood in the aisle all the time during the flight. Once they announced  there will be a delay at the arrival and they will give further information about connecting flights. The passenger next to me asked how long the delay will probably be but the stewardess did not know. They also announced a gate as arrival position in MUC which doesn't exist. The seats were good, with enough space even for tall passengers, but  only two lavatories for 180 economy passengers? There was no inflight entertainment. Really poor for a four hour flight. The meal was pretty good and rich but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our first drink and there was no second beverage round as on the outward flight to TLV.  Lufthansa makes many promises with their advertisement of being a five star airline butare not able to keep many of them on longer flights with the A321. I will think about an alternate low-cost flight next time.";NEGATIVE

They bussed us from the plane at Terminal A through the Maze to Terminal B. I flat out ran through the Frankfurt airport to make my connection. When I got in, of course there was no overhead room. Attendant told me I could go check at the back of the plane (was sitting in row 6). Leaving Barcelona the flight to Frankfurt is currently delayed an hour and a half. This time, dreading the run through the airport I ask the attendant what the ETA is because I have another tight connection and he says he won't be able to say until we are 15 minutes from landing. I will never be flying with LH again. ";NEGATIVE

Bumped from business to the back of coach (paid full fare for the tickets) because of overbooking. Arrive for our connection in Frankfurt to find they changed our children from 3 seats together to 3 random middle seats. No explanation or solution. Just a shrug. Wi-Fi doesn’t work, no entertainment on FRA-TLV flight. Business class on our connecting European flight is literally three coach seats with the middle seat blocked off. Never fly this airline again.

lufthansa;2018-03-13;" |  I had heard good things about Lufthansa's business class and  selected them for this flight from Bangkok to Frankfurt. I regret the decision. The worst feature is the extremely narrow seat. I'm not large but found it to be a tight fit around the shoulders. Also, the seat is on a sideways angle, meaning that it's not a natural position in which to sleep in the bed mode, further complicated by the fact that the footwell is very narrow indeed. This is a 2-2-2 configuration and the seats are far too close to each other and lack any real sense of privacy (nor do they have a privacy screen). I do the same sector frequently and this is by far the worst of the major airlines. The cabin looks great but in practical terms (ie the need to sleep), it is very poor. I only wanted a snack for dinner on a midnight departure and chose a Thai prawn appetiser (dry and miserable) and some cheese (dreary but edible) With so many other great business class choices available, it's extremely unlikely I would choose Lufthansa again.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2018-03-06;" |  New York to Berlin in business class. Flights were fine. Security at JFK T1 is always disorganized, with pre check sometimes available and often not. This time, there was  a dedicated lane, I got to pass with shoes on, but, at x ray, the officer suddenly insisted “there is no precheck” and sent my bag to be prodded, examined and swabbed. LH owns a quarter of T1 and so would seem to have a at least a quarter of the responsibility to sort out the chronic security mess. The lounge was overcrowded and under catered, worn and unchanged. Pre flight dining is now a standard expectation for C class transatlantic flights, but here for a 10.30 pm departure, the offer is a bowl of canned vegetables, sadly wilting on a steam table, next to Teriyaki chicken. There are also some chicken wraps, just about edible. The wines are basic. Pre flight at TXL is even worse. Mobile boarding passes must be exchanged for paper at the desk - no obvious reason. the lounge is outside security, shabby, with a flair of filth. At 4pm, when you might want a bite to catch up on a missed lunch, catering consists of pretzel and potato salad. The security line is long and slow, inspection excessively manual. When you are on the plane, things improve. The A330 on the route has an F cabin but operates C class only, so the front is partly given away to preferred passengers and partly sold to less preferred ones for Euro 450 per leg. I got an F seat free on the way over and paid for the way back, so had very comfortable flights. Of course the experience is not representative of regular C, which is the 2x2x2 layout. Food in flight was fine and in-flight service consistently warm, attentive and efficient. LH business is way behind the pack.";NEGATIVE

This was just the begin of our horror trip .We spent almost six hours at DUS airport trying to rebook our flight. Customer service desk at the airport was rude and unwilling to help, so we had to rebook our flight to LAX on our own, via the Lufthansa call-centre. Unfortunately the first available flight was on the next day from FRA. Few words to the flight itself. I know flying economy class you can not expect too much. But the seat comfort and entertainment on Lufthansa A380 is in my opinion below average. Seats comparing to other airlines (KLM and Aeromexico) felt very cramped and uncomfortable and touchscreens unresponsive. The only positive aspect of the flight was the flight crew, which was very attentive. After coming back from our trip in September we claimed for compensation from Lufthansa for our cancelled flight and almost 30 hours delayed arrival in Los Angeles. Unfortunately no respose till today (February 18th 2018). ";NEGATIVE

They are slightly wider, have more legroom and more generous recline. Furthermore, each seat has a power socket. The service was basically an economy service with some enhancements (juice as welcome drink, food was served on china plates, but is the same food as in Economy). The flight attendants were professional as usual on Lufthansa, but the service was nothing exceptional. The food was ok: the pasta was overcooked and slightly tasteless, but I have had much worse in Economy. Breakfast was better than expected. If the price is right, I will fly Premium Economy with Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-02-17;" |  Whilst I am very proud that Lufthansa has become the first European airline to be awarded 5 Stars and they got it so right with the logo redesign, it is unfortunately also still true that the situation at its main hub, Frankfurt, leaves a lot to be desired for. Traveling every week on the same route (to and from Milan) from Frankfurt, the chances of boarding a departing flight via a finger directly from the terminal are 50/50. Sometimes buses depart from gates in the newly added terminal A part that require a good 10 mins walk to get there. Arriving into Frankfurt almost always means an apron position somewhere on the tarmac and easily a 10 mins bus drive. So, for instance landing on the relatively new runway West, taxiing can take 10 mins to the parking position, sometimes adding waiting time for buses to arrive and 10 mins to get to the terminal? That adds up to almost 50% of the flying time from Milan! Crazy. Frankfurt airport uses retired, cramped buses from local public transport bus companies. Then arriving bus passengers get cattled via a narrow staircase into the terminal, where on some lucky days there are two airport employees with iPads helping with gate information but generally being overwhelmed by the number of passengers asking for information. Sometimes connecting passengers are left to their own devices at this badly signposted airport with only a few areas where screens would provide up-to-date gate information. But the worst part is how Lufthansa and Frankfurt airport are providing for premium travelers (with the exception of HONs and First Class passengers). Long waiting times at security and in the Schengen Area in Terminal A there are a total of 3 lounges that, at peak times, are more than overcrowded. Schengen departures in Terminal B have no lounge access whatsoever. Guests in the three lounges (2 business, one Senator/Star Alliance Gold) can stand for an hour and are being catered for by a disappointing offer of food. All this leaves regular Lufthansa clients guessing why the airline gets it so right with their second hub Munich (2 Business lounges and a total of 4 Senator lounges/areas). In their London, Munich and hopefully soon Malpensa lounge, Lufthansa also provides a much more sophisticated food offer compared to its main hub, Frankfurt. So what is it, that is the cause of this difference? Maybe all Lufthansa management responsible for travel experience should be paired up with a passenger and follow their real travel experience for the duration of their Frankfurt airport stay to help realize, how sub-optimal the whole set-up really is.";POSITIVE

On time landing, and through immigration and luggage collected within 20 minutes of landing. Only negative is the boarding procedure in Munich.

We were just stuck in the aircraft, doors closed, and not moving. After asking multiple times, I was told by the FA it was because of fog in FRA. When I proceeded to claim compensation, the airline told me it was because of French Air Traffic Control Strike. Remembering the chaos in FRA airport that evening, I have a hard time believing that. No staff was available to provide assistance once arrived in FRA airport. All customer service desks were closed, even though it was obvious that there was a big mess in FRA. It was impossible to reach the hotline to check for alternative flights. I stayed online for 2 times 45 mns, before giving up. So I organized my own hotel, transportation and meals, and in line with EU regulation 261/2004, I asked the airline to pay for the expense incurred. It has now been 4 months, and I have yet to receive the funds. I received a reply 6 weeks ago telling me the payment has been made, but it never reached my bank account. Now, customer relations department is just playing dead. On the onboard experience itself, I would say that the crew is professional, but rather cold. Food is edible, but I thought below average of other full service airlines. The major issue lies with FRA airport, where connections are very long: I had to walk 35 mns and take a train to reach the other terminal. Security was very long, with only 2 lines open, and rude staff at every checkpoint (passport control, security, boarding gates). Considering the ticket price, I will not fly with them again, mostly because of FRA airport, and the ""ghost"" customer relations department. I cannot believe they received a 5 star rating.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-02-02;" |  Munich to Athens. The points I mention don´t mean much, but in combination they make you wonder why you spent more than the price of an economy class ticket. Outbound flight MUC-ATH (Jan.13th, 2018): I noticed that the Business Class security fast lane at MUC airport was not open. The food in the business lounge at MUC is fine but the same. When boarding the aircraft you used to be addressed by name, not for me. The A321 business cabins have a fixed tray table across the middle seat which is very awkward for sitting down and getting up when you have a window seat. An economy class passenger stowed his hand luggage in the business class overhead compartment. No welcome drink, and announcements in German and English, no Greek.  The onboard choice of meals consisted of two main courses, the one I chose I found inedible. LH always serves freshly baked bread which is nice but for some reason they forgot me so I had to ask for it. After meal, economy class passengers queued to use the business class toilet. Return flight ATH-MUC the lounge at ATH airport nice with  better food than MUC but no toilets. Staff took the trouble to annouce LH departures personally which was a nice touch. At gate, priority boarding was announced but not enforced. This is one of the most annoying problems with LH business class travel and it happens all the time. On the flight, again no announcements in Greek, food markedly better, but disorganised service. They didn´t come around to ask if you wanted any extra drinks after meal service, and some tray tables stayed down into final approach at MUC. All in all, not a five-star experience.";NEGATIVE

Flight from Frankfurt to New York served a delicious chicken and pasta dish. Got exit row seats on both flights, and an exit row in economy actually offers at least twice the room of a premium economy seat. Drinks services seemed to be a bit stingier than they used to be, but you could still pop back to the galley for an extra drink and bag of crisps. Overall, great flights, and I'd happily use Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE

Overall crew were extremely pleasant and efficient on both flights. Lounges were nice, with interesting food and beverages. Seats were clean and comfortable. However, on both flights catering was a disappointment. Japanese food from KIX was just uneatable. Most Japanese pax returned food. Western food from FRA had no taste.";POSITIVE

Don’t know what the  premium experience they claim is in that.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2018-01-30; |  London to Osaka via Frankfurt. I received an extremely unpleasant experience. Not a single flight departed on time causing severe delays during my journey.  Worst in-flight meal service I have seen. No response to my complaint regarding the disruption of my journey). It seemed like Lufthansa tries to save money by cancelling partially booked flights and putting everybody on the last flight on the day. I had that experience in Frankfurt when two Frankfurt – London flights were cancelled and everybody was placed on the latest flight in the evening. I will make sure to avoid this company at all costs in the future.;NEGATIVE

There was nothing to complain about and I was well rested and relaxed in Frankfurt. Landed and was in the office at noon. The genuine friendliness of the flight attendants and personal attention onboard is unparalleled. The staff do their job with dedication and that creates an absolutely pleasant atmosphere. Continue like that Lufthansa. It was time that not just our cars are 5 stars | Es ist wirklich ein Vergnügen mit Lufthansa zu fliegen. Der Service wird ständig optimiert und ist absolut auf 5 Sterne Niveau jetzt. Absolut verdient!

lufthansa;2018-01-15;" |  London to Moscow via Frankfurt. Flying from London to Frankfurt was reasonable though we were very irritated that our seats had been changed. The cabin crew were pleasant. Transiting in Frankfurt was very efficient, with a representative meeting us on the exit of the aircraft and took us to our gate. The queues there were long with first a document check and then general boarding. Not only were we delayed by over 40 minutes but our seats were changed again from row 6 to row 33. To say we were irritated would be an understatement. The flight was extremely full and there was barely space to put our hand luggage. We felt sympathy for the cabin crew as they were clearly exhausted, having to work on Christmas Eve on an evening flight. On our return flight, check-in was super quick but boarding was quite chaotic though relatively speedy in the end. We again had our seats changed but it was to the emergency exit row. We transited at MUC before continuing on to LHR. Nothing pretty remarkable for such a short flight. Overall, Lufthansa do well in terms of seat comfort but the food is quite repetitive. However, they are to be commended for being one of the few airlines to maintain a complimentary onboard service in economy.In addition, whilst the cabin crew are satisfactory, they lack the some hospitality and come across coldly.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-01-12;" |  Manchester to Los Angeles via Munich. Smooth transit through Manchester airport and comfortable lounge - very friendly staff which helped. Short haul flight comfortable with a continental breakfast served, FAs attentive and a pillow given as we slumbered on the way (6am flight). In Munich, straight into terminal building and next flight only a few gates away. Again lounge comfortable and functional - not a huge selection to eat. Next flight 12 hours to LAX, Onboard dining was really good and tasty, a plus there. Seats okay - 2x2x2 in a row with FA reaching over to window seat to serve meals and seat narrows off in foot end, so doesn't feel particularly spacious. Nice to lie fully flat on a long journey, would not say the seat is greatly comfortable for sleep, if anything a bit hard. FAs happy to serve when called (needed a bit of encouragement). 8 hours in, came round with regular water etc. Have flown 1st class with Lufthansa and loved it. business is a bit of a poor relation in comparison.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2018-01-11;" | As a German I used Lufthansa quite regularly and during the last few years I was never happy with the value for money of my home carrier. That started to change from 2016 and now I have had another great experience with LH. Flown Hannover - Frankfurt - Miami and back Atlanta - Frankfurt in premium economy class. Short flight HAJ to FRA as usual, in time, small snack, nothing special, but its just 40 mins in the air. FRA-MIA on A380 premium economy. Thats very good value for money. Seats are spacious to all sides, IFE monitor is bigger. Cabin is seperated from economy class. Food is economy class food but served on porcelain. They serve two meals on that flights, both of them have beem surprisingly good. Beverage selection and IFE have been good as well. Staff helpful, friendly and professional. Flight was on time. On the way back from Atlanta it was an A340, cabin was not clearly seperate from eco class, but seats and food have the same comfort as on the A380. Flight was also on time. The only negative thing was that both flights have been heavily overbooked. On the way to US they announce at the gate that every business class traveller which would downgrade to premium economy would get 800 Euro. So far so good, but actually the rate difference was 900 Euro per way (at least what I got offered). On the way back they offered all passengers at check in which volunteer to fly next day 800 USD. However especially on US flights I see that happens regularly, so no big deal as long as they find volunteers.";POSITIVE

Munich to Kyiv flight a new aircraft, emergency row seat. I couldn't extend my legs. The seats are thin.

lufthansa;2018-01-08;" | Flew Frankfurt to Osaka. Very unsympathetic ground services, but what a wonderful flight! There is a Lufthansa Business class check-in counter inside ""long distance trains"" station at FRA airport. What a great idea! 10 meters after leaving the train from Munich, we instantly dropped our luggage. However we had no friendly welcome at all at counter, neither information about lounge, gate whatsoever. Next passenger please! Neither a smiley welcome at gate, except from a Japanese attendant. Also boarding was slow and lacking information about slight delay. It seems that LH has improved the quality of inflight service but, on the ground, passengers, in any class, always seem to bother attendants. Something has to be done as we faced a similar situation in GIG. Fortunately on board (upper deck), a fabulous moment. Fabulous crew, great food and drinks (except cheap Champagne). Attention at all moments. On arrival, a feeling of sadness of leaving a place with such a level of efficiency, comfort and sympathy.";POSITIVE

It's not the first time I pass from this airport, but for me they got worse a lot. Intercontinental flights left from the tarmac and not from the fingers.  The on board service was really good, Food, cabin crew, good space for legs, made us allowed to fly relaxed. Lufthansa got 5 stars recently from Skytrax. it's to early to judge but this first experience was very good.";POSITIVE

Excellent flight, service etc. Despite the old model (744 vs 747/8) now from GIG, a pleasant moment on upper deck.  Previous LH flight was cancelled, and its crew was at gate of our flight, not wearing uniforms, just trying to go back home for New years' eve. They had their LH hand luggage, but no identification. Of course they were on stand-by as far as our flight might be full of paying passengers. 2 mins before boarding they were informed they could board. Then they split in 2 groups. Most of them went quietly to the back of Business class passengers line. But 3 of them rushed in front of the same long line, with no apology whatsoever. ";POSITIVE

The business class seat features a full flat bed of almost 1.9m in bed mode - more than adequate for most people. The flight attendant introduced himself at the beginning of the flight and came to take dinner orders shortly before take off. Dinner service was efficient and served course by course. The truffles ravioli that I had was delicious. After dinner, I managed to get a good 9 hours continuous sleep before breakfast service prior to arrival. I did use the onboard wifi. It was €17 for the entire flight and the connection speed was good. As it as a red eye flight, I did not use the IFE except for the sound track and flight path. I would recommend Lufthansa’a Business class product.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-12-29;" |  Frankfurt to Mexico. We connected in Frankfurt from a flight coming from Brussels, disembarking this flight we were met by a driver who took us with a Mercedes to the exit nearest to the First Class Terminal. We had to exit the airport and walk about 200 meters. alternatively we could have used a First Class lounge in the airport but we preferred the First Class Terminal. The First Class Terminalwas a good choice as it is just fabulous. I also had sufficient time to take a shower (accompanied with a First Class Terminal duck). About 20 minutes before departure an agent took us to the Mercedes that drove us directly to the plane. With a dedicated elevator we went up close to the first class entrance of the plane. Seating in the nose of the Boeing 747-8i is very spacious and comfortable. The seat converts into a flat bed and you can raise a privacy screen. Soon after takeoff caviar was served which is one of the highlights of a Lufthansa first class flight. Soon some appetizers were served followed by the main course. There were 4 options for the main course. duck (which I’m not fond of), a beef stew (also not my favourite), a vegetarian option (pappardelle) or fish. Since fish was the only option I was attracted to I took it. The fish was ‘loup de mer’, presentation was rather uninspired and the taste was extremely salt. Luckily the cheese and dessert trolley had some very good options and all was served very professionally by the crew which was one of the best and most dedicated I ever had. Champagnes and wines were not the most well renowned names as with some other airlines but the quality was extremely good and typical for the regions/varieties. Just before landing the crew came to say us goodbye personally. We landed on time in MEX and were welcomed by a Lufthansa representative holding a board with our names. The representative took us directly to the diplomatic passport immigration desks. Next we went to the luggage belt where our HON labelled luggage was already standing in front of the belt. This was really amazing. from getting out of the aeroplane to getting out of the airport with our luggage took us only a couple of minutes. This was the fastest I ever went through immigration. Overall an unforgettable trip despite the main course that didn’t fully meet our expectations.";POSITIVE

In case I had traveled with luggage the situation was totally different since there was only one position open for all passengers with luggage. Directly after boarding something strange happened, another passenger had the same seat allocated as me. I had to move because this lady had HON status! Fortunately there was another window seat available for me. Fortunately I did not have a short connection in Munchen, there were long lines for immigration and security  which took in total about 45 minutes. While boarding the 2nd leg of the trip my bag was labelled as 'Gate-ramp delivery', ignoring the fact that I was booked in C while other passengers with LH Senator labels were left in peace. At the end I had 12 seats for myself and had plenty of space for my trolley. On both legs the cabin crew were as usual friendly and attentive. Legroom in the A319 was OK but the CRJ felt very cramped.";POSITIVE

The flight was 10 hours late due to a strike that wasn’t LHs fault - they provided us with a hotel near the airport but the logistics of getting to and from the hotel was a  mess and we just made it in time for our flight the next morning. Onboard, the crew did the minimum and were not friendly. The meal awful, toilet was not clean when I used it. My IFE took time to load and freezes frequently. I will avoid flying this airline in the future - it was very poor and unfriendly in Economy.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-12-19;" | Toronto to Manchester via Frankfurt. The transfer at Frankfurt was terrible, having to change terminals, use a train and go through security again so contacted the customer service and asked for my return flight if I could have an earlier flight from Manchester to Frankfurt. This would involve a 3am start and I would have to pay for a hotel. Was told that this couldn't be done but if I turned up for the flight and checked in the change could be made at check-in. Turned up at 04:00 to be told this isn't possible and I have to phone Lufthansa. Made the call and after an hour and 300 EUR I had the earlier flight. Arrived at Frankfurt and began the delays, 2 hours at the gate, then 4 hours sat on the plane as the de-icer was needed, then it was needed again. So arrived after a 23 hour day still to ensure a 4 hour drive home. So, sent an e-mail and letter to Lufthansa giving them my feedback from my first trip with them, the bad customer service and the great cabin crew. Received a call from the customer service team (located in Manila) with an apology and an offer of 600 EUR compensation. Agreed this and felt that Lufthansa had actually listened to me. 2 hours later receive a call to tell me a mistake has been made and the compensation is only 300 EUR - sorry I say, you made an offer which was accepted and I'm not accepting you changing your mind. They told me they would speak to a manager and call me back. Received an e-mail 20 minutes later to tell me my 'request' for compensation had been rejected and a cheque had been issued for the lower amount. So I called the team and over the next four days received a long line of contradictions - 'The manager will speak to you now, the manager went home whilst you were waiting, we will only talk to a lawyer, we cannot let you speak to a member of Lufthansa, we are a call agency'. Tried social media, tried all the numbers to no avail. Will never bother them with my business again.";NEGATIVE

The flight attendants were very prompt and professional. The food was perfectly prepared and was one of the best economy three course meal. We had two hot choices - chicken and pasta. The bar service was very good offering drinks three times during dinner. Lufthansa is really the best European airline and I recommend them for the route to Georgia.";POSITIVE

The boarding was well organized (30 mins with full load factor). Our plane was a reconstructed B747-400 thus the cabin was clean and nice, the seats were really comfortable. The legroom is perfect for a 7 hours 30 mins flight. The catering was fast, large selection of drinks (alcoholic, non alcoholic) and food was offered in Economy Class. The inflight entertainment system includes eternal opportunities to be entertained: movies, cartoons, documentaries, music, games and live tv. The flight was smooth. Our connection time in Frankfurt was enough to catch our plane to Budapest. The level of the service on this short-haul flight was excellent as always. I would say that Lufthansa is the best option on a transatlantic route.";POSITIVE

The small Lufthansa lounge at New York's JFK Terminal 1 was very empty, the selection average, a mixture of cold and hot food and drinks. 10 min late, the boarding commenced. First to enter the plane are business and first class passengers. Greeted by a very lovely flight attendeant, I got served an orange juice. Soon after takeoff, I got nuts and another cold drink. The selection on the menu was as expected for a 7 hour flight: one main meal and 1.5 hours before arrival, a small breakfast. The vegetarian option was excellent, the pasta cooked well. After the food service, the lights were dimmed. I tried my seat functions, pretty standard seat for business class. Yet I was happy about the lie flat seat. The entertainment system worked well, the selection of movies was quite impressive! The only downside to the entertainment options I found was WiFi connectivity. It did not connect for 2/3 devices of mine. Also, the price of WiFi is very high considering I flew in Business class. Some airlines offer this service for free. After a long sleep, a flight attended woke me up and asked to serve me breakfast. This was a much more simple meal, all on one tray. Then I arrived in Berlin. The aircraft was parked at a stand so the deboarding process took longer than at a gate, having to fill the busses with passengers. Overall, a very good experience!";POSITIVE

Prior to boarding, LH sends out a link where you can download magazines for your flight. Even though there was no in-flight entertainment such as movies, this was an innovative way of rectifying this issue. Business class in Europe, apart from Turkish, is generally done with economy seating and the middle one kept free. That is pretty much the standard. This A321 was the newer generation with the new sharklets (winglets) and looked brand new, the seats were good but no better than in Economy. The service was excellent. even though the flight was relatively short, just over an hour, we were served smoked salmon, some meat and a dessert which were all delicious. On US carriers you would be hard pressed to get such a good meal on a transcontinental flight in First Class.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-12-05;" |  Denver to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt, The worst part was the food, but the meals were inedible.  The seats were very uncomfortable, new slimline designs which mean less cushion and thin armrests. The airline only allows one checked bag from the US, even on international flights if flying in economy - the economy plus averages about $300 more, so certainly not affordable for most travelers, but if you can afford it, it's 100% worth it for the bigger seats, screens, and extra checked bag. The wifi never worked for me on board my flights.  The only positives were the flight attendants were really nice and they did have free alcohol (as all international flights should) so that helped me get through an otherwise awful experience.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2017-12-02;" | Budapest to Venice via Munich. The first flight from Budapest departed with 20-30 mins of delay. This is ok as delays can occur and the duration was rather short. However, arrival in Munich was also delayed in turn by 20-30 mins. The connection in Munich was known in advance to be short, for which reason it is expected that the airline has foreseen how to manage this flight combination. Instead this connection was managed very poorly. Arrival in Munich airport took place at the gate area K, while the connecting flight (to Venice) was at gate area G. This, according to the screen indication itself, requires 17 mins of transfer time. Upon arrival, I noticed on the screen that the connecting flight was already boarding. After taking the shuttle train (needed for this transfer) and running the rest of the way, I arrived at the gate only to discover that the flight was gone. It seems nobody bothered to advise that there was somebody on the way, and hopefully the plane could wait for a mere 10 mins. Offering a connection implies that it is reasonably managed. In spite of the short connection in this case, it seems the airline makes it even worse by setting flights at different areas and not advising of people in transfer. I would never ask a plane with all passengers to wait for a long time, but I do not believe 10 mins would be an issue for anyone. After the above experience, I went to the service desk for help, where I was told that there is ""fortunately another flight tonight"". That meant at 22:00 vs. the original 15:30 that I missed. To illustrate the staff's further lack of customer service, I was told I am eligible for a voucher since I will spend a long time at the airport. I was given a voucher for 10 euros. After indicating that a 10-euro voucher does not seem exactly a correct response from the airline for the trouble caused, I was told that maybe it was a system error, and after a second check, the staff confirmed that in fact I am eligible for 17 euro. I did not continue the discussion as it would have been a waste of time. The above service gives me an impression that the airline simply does not care. In fact it feels like a joke. In any case, I would have expected a much different treatment for a company with a German origin and reputation. Obviously for the future I will avoid this specific flight connection, but I will also avoid Lufthansa connections in general as well.";NEGATIVE

And again, as often the case, plane was late because of late arrival - or because they changed the aircraft to a larger one. The 30 min delay was - as always - communicated only at the gate. Seat changed from the first row in economy to somewhere in the back. I am happy to fly with other airlines next week.";NEGATIVE

The level of service was also good right from check, onboard and disembarking. The plane was clean and tidy and I would recommend them as a premium short haul carrier. However I do think between KLM and Lufthansa I would fly KLM within Europe as a preferred carrier.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-11-29; | Frankfurt to Nice. Cabin looked modern and clean and the aircraft was quite new as well (A320neo). The price was average but the service Lufthansa provides on domestic/european flights is something you cannot take for granted these days. I was surprised they still supplied free drinks and a snack which shows they still value the customers comfort. Flight attendants were friendly and well trained. Only the Self-Service Check-in at Frankfurt Airport might be a bit inconvenient but Lufthansa staff were eager to help. Overall a good experience;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-11-28; |  Dresden to Frankfurt. Flight was delayed. The seat and the table was dirty. Dinner did not look appetizing. No Entertainment Programm. Flight attendant was not that friendly. There is no value to economic class except the expensive price from Business class;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-11-22;" |  Berlin to Frankfurt. The Boeing 747 is my favourite aircraft and Lufthansa flew that on this route. One thing I had to complain about (I guess that is more a Berlin TXL problem than LH) is that there were no open check-in counter in Terminal C where this flight departed. I guess it was because usually LH departs Terminal A but there was no space for the 747. There might have been a problem for people with checked-in luggage or people who wanted to check in at the airport. The flight itself was the best I have had so far. The crew was very friendly, the entertainment program was good and they gave everyone a chocolate teddy after landing. The space between seats was good, I'm 1.67m and I could stretch my legs - I guess there were 10-15cm to the seat in front of me. All in all a very pleasant flight.";POSITIVE

The cabin crew was great. The seat was slightly narrow though. The leg room was very limited as well. My IFE wasn't working, and it wasn't fixed even after being promised. I had a similar experience with IFE on my previous Lufthansa flight. Food was sumptuous but ordinary. All these negative aspects got covered up for by the highly trained pilots and staff. The take-off and landing were very smooth. The aircraft was very well maintained. The cabin was very quiet as well.";POSITIVE

We have to congratulate one staff who was the flight customer service most friendly in the world, specially with my mother who needed a wheel chair arriving Frankfurt from London on Saturday 11 of November. He took us as if we were his family (we were 6 people) and guided us wonderfully through this huge Frankfurt Airport to the Hilton Garden Hotel. However at the following morning (Sunday 12, November) despite we asked for similar service (a wheelchair), Lufthansa failed totally. We waited about 45 minutes in the Hotel reception, to received a laconic communication from the airline explaining that was ""system failure"" and did not book the service. On the other hand, Lufthansa services and his workers in the airport are in a bad mood. Returning to Panama was an odyssey trying to get information about the process of check-in. And we had to weigh our luggage and put the tags ourselves? And the boarding gate place B62 is awful it looks like a 19th century factory.";POSITIVE

I dont think I will fly LH again. ";NEGATIVE

Flight back who was supposed to leave 7:15 has not yet started boarding at 7:30 - while they still keep saying it's late 20 min. Operations and info policy is very weak, also no coffee, no newspapers, nothing at the gate. And it's probably getting worser and higher prices since they do not have competition anymore. Definitely not premium!";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-11-01;" | Lufthansa promised me a full refund last month. I haven't got a cent back, and judging by the comments on their facebook page, I might have to wait a year, or forever! 2 days after buying my ticket, Lufthansa changed the flights: turning a 1 hour layover into over 5 hours. I bought the ticket at a premium to avoid very early departures and very late arrivals. Lufthansa could no longer deliver that and after over 30 minutes on the phone (costing over 10 euros), I accepted to get a full refund. That was October 6th. I have not got a cent back. I fly between Oslo and Malta at least 5 times a year with this airline. This rescheduling of flights happened to me many times before, but it is the first time that I had to accept a full refund (I still haven't got it, despite contacting the airline several times). Needless to say, my 5+ return tickets per year will be bought with another airline from now on. LH is HL: HopeLess.";NEGATIVE

First of all our first flight is delayed, but when we arrive at Frankfurt airport we are told that we will be able to reach our connected flight with assistance from your employees. We were at the airport 12.30 from Manchester, our next flight got scheduled to 13.45 - at 13.10 we were outside the gate (with at least 20 other people) and were refused entrance, overbooked? They were helpful at the service desk, however to get to the hotel is terrible, rooms are messy, the food voucher we got is turned in to a buffet.  I'm stuck at the airport hotel with nothing to eat, and I will not be able to go to work tomorrow. We already sent in a complaint, but I expected more a flight carrier when things that no one of us have control over happens.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-30; |  Dresden to London Heathrow via Munich. Credit where credit is due. Flights all delayed due to terrible weather yet Lufthansa did a fantastic job getting me to my connection with an individual taxi style transfer from plane to plane at Munich allowing me to make a meeting in London. Really very efficient and well planned transfer operation as I have witnessed on a few other trips as well. Would highly recommend transiting through Lufthansa hubs (both Munich and Frankfurt).;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-30;" |  Short flight from Brussels to Munich. Boarding was orderly and the flight was full with most people seeming to prefer carry-on as opposed to check luggage, the reason would become clear once we landed. The LH flights to and from Brussels use the T2 annex which means that collecting your bags takes ages in this case 45 min after the plane landed! The flight itself was good with a sandwich and drinks service. Sear 10C has plenty of legroom and the neo are very quiet. Flight left a few minutes later but made up time and landed as scheduled.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-29;" |  Munich to Geneva. Flew this for a short break between business trips. Small cozy aircraft - I always liked a bombardier. Small snack given, quite OK for the short trip. No inflight entertainment system but quite OK for a short trip. The flight attendants were helpful and friendly. The seats were comfortable and even though I had a seat empty next to me, having someone next to me would not affect the space that much. The only downside is for the next flight (which was not on star alliance) I was not able to check in my luggage through and thus had to exit the transit area and collect my luggage to check it in again. Ground staff was clear when they informed this to me.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-28; |  I am a regular Lufthansa customer and fly over 300.000 miles a year. LH is usually a good and reliable airline. One of my biggest complaint is the flow of economy passengers using the front lavatories. On my last flight from Lisbon to Frankfurt there were 6 people queuing up in the aisle waiting for the lavatory making it almost impossible for business pax to use the lavatories. This for some reason is standard procedure on LH. Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called ‘priority customers’ which are seated on rows 1&2. Food quality and quantity is also on the decline. If flying in Europe I try to avoid them and prefer LX and OS which are both owned by LH but have much higher standards.;POSITIVE

The second leg was Lufthansa, lousy food and poor choice of beverages. Flights were more or less in time. Entertainment was average, not extraordinary. Flight attendants polite but not friendly.";POSITIVE

Our flight LH 2301 was scheduled to leave Amsterdam at 8.55 am but did not leave the airfield until 9.43 am. While we were waiting in the airport there was never an announcement as to why it was late. We had an international connecting flight to Los Angeles leaving at 11.20 am. We barely made it there and I was having a meltdown. As anyone who has ever been in Munich airport will agree, it is not the easiest to navigate though. The only time Air Dolomiti said anything was before they landed apologizing for the ""delay"". Once again, no explanation. We are done with Lufthansa.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-23;" |  London to Dresden via Frankfurt. First time with Lufthansa, short queue checking in at Heathrow so good start, but soon after entering the airport flight information was showing a 25 minute delay. Eventually boarded plane and flight took off around 1 hour late, problems with crew apparently. During the flight we were  told that they had no information about connecting flights and should check the flight boards in the airport. But as soon as we landed and I switched on my phone I had an email stating that I was booked on the later 22:05 flight to Dresden. Facing a 4 hour wait at the airport I went to the very busy Lufthansa service desk where I asked if I could use their airport lounge. As I was only an economy customer and not a Lufthansa member the answer was no. I was given a 10 euro voucher and a copy of my rights as a passenger.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-18;" |  Newark-Liberty Intl to Munich, LH0413, 18 Sept 2017. I did not expect something elegant or sophisticated from Lufthansa, but their service was appalling. The flight was delayed due to ""late arrival of the plane"". Quite worn out plane, not much of a welcome on board, dim light in the cabin did not make me feel bad in the beginning but definitely was not comforting. I do not mind not smiling FA's if the level of service is high. On this flight, I learned for the first time what means lousy service in business class, definitely not expected from 4-star airline. Frugal menu had one appetizer (salad) with no other choices. I chose fish for the main course which was greasy, overly salty and poorly presented. Everything came on the same tray. During the meal, no drink refills were offered (I had regular coke), so I had to ask for a favor. After I asked for the tray to be taken away, FA took it and asked me to throw the tablecloth and serviette on top of the tray. I expected a dessert would have been offered but was wrong. So again I had to ask for one. Not happy with my request, FA asked what I wanted and finally brought a portion of fruits which was placed on the table without any preparation. After such ""feast"" I tried to sleep but the seat was (though full flat) bumpy and extremely narrow even for me (I am a slim person). So the only comfortable position was lying on my side. Finally, I was able to fall asleep but was awaken soon by the noise from the galley where FAs were loudly talking without lowering their voices. About 1 hour before landing I asked for breakfast. It was not served right away, so the seatbelt sign came on. FA told me that now the breakfast could not be served. No single positive emotion during the whole flight. Extremely lousy service is only memorable thing about Lufthansa. My flight back with United (Polaris business class) was a pleasant surprise – frankly, I expected the opposite for these two carriers. Lesson learned: Lufthansa’s business is an awkward decoration of a comfort+ class with a flatbed (though very uncomfortable). Given the price for the ticket (almost 9 thousand US $), I will choose Lufthansa only if there is absolutely no alternative.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-18;" |  Amsterdam to Addis Ababa via Frankfurt. The onboard service is above average and the legroom is good. However, I had booked to leave on August 25th. On arrival at Schiphol the flight was canceled. Overbooking on another flight was not possible, everything was full. Other flights to Frankfurt departed that evening. Also on Saturdays there was only place on flights with at least three stops and a journey time which was twice as long as planned. Then only one flight took 2 days (!) Later, which cost me 2 days. Cancellation can happen and the fact that there were no good alternatives was not to blame Lufthansa. Where I can admit that Lufthansa does not wish to pay my claim. They indicate that the flight was canceled by the weather conditions. That's strange if you take into account that this was the only flight that was canceled that night, KLM just left Frankfurt. One could easily leave with a delay of an hour or so. Now, in addition to the lack of working hours, I have to make expenses to get what I am entitled to. So service on board 8.5, handling complaints a 2 - the staff is friendly, average 4.2 so. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-17;" |  Athens to Vancouver via Munich. Despite the comfortable seat and good inflight entertainment in premium economy from Munich to Vancouver, our experience was frustrating, flat out disappointing. We could not check in one of 4 travelers online under one booking. Error messages such as unfortunately you are unable to check in online, your name, ticket number etc may be incorrect, and your routing does not match your ticket. Error messages were different every time we tried so you didn’t know what exactly was the reason. We were questioning whether he even had a ticket. Called customer service multiple times only for them to tell us to call tech support which was not open 24/7. We had to wait. Tech support advised that passenger was selected randomly to manually check in at the airport. Had that message shown at online check in, it would have avoided some undue stress and costly int’l roaming charges for calls. Original gate from ATH-MUN was rather close to our MUN-YVR, however we needed all the time we could get to go through exit customs since my mother in law is unable to run. On arrival, the gate of the current flight had changed, and it could not have been father away from our connecting fight. Boarding an A330 MUN-YVR was a disaster. Other than frequent flyers/business class boarding first, it was general boarding for everyone all at once and this included wheelchair passengers. If you’re a seasoned traveler, you know boarding in an orderly fashion from the back of the aircraft to the front helps prevent backlogs. Passengers were backlogged on the jet bridge so that it piled up back to a short escalator that was available to passengers and their carry ons which most, if not all, used it. Safety issue here is that it bunched up people all the way to the bottom of the escalator where those getting off had no place to go. Upon arrival into YVR, we were advised our checked baggage did not make the connection in MUN and advised they will deliver our bags the following evening. They were not delivered as promised the following evening and delivered another 12 hours later the following morning. Total 40hrs. We wrote an email to customer relations right after the online check in fiasco and the email did warrant a response from Lufthansa. It has been 7 days and still no response. ";NEGATIVE

Both flights were pleasant, cabin crew was very friendly, food was minimal but still tasty. Seats were slightly narrow but felt decent enough for short flights. Two-hour layover in Frankfurt was enough to get through security and passport control with time to spare. On arrival in Brussels proceeded straight to baggage claim, where I waited only a couple of minutes for my suitcase so I managed to catch the bus on time. On my way back to Belgrade flown via Munich instead, but the experience was equally good. Would definitely fly with Lufthansa again in the future.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-14; |  Nice to Frankfurt. Check-in at Nice Airport was fast and efficient but there were not enough seats at the gate so many people had to stand and wait. Even though there was a little delay the crew made up for everything being nice and very attentive. Really cherish that Lufthansa sticks to a good service also on short-haul flights providing free drinks and snacks so you feel valued as a customer. Lufthansa is a reliable and efficient airline that maintains a high standard in customer care.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-07;" |  Manchester to Beijing return via Frankfurt. First time in over 5 years that I used Lufthansa and they have really improved. Certainly make BA look like a true low-cost airline! Short sector to Frankfurt on A320 was comfortable enough, with nice meal in business class and fabulous and chatty crew. Transfer in Frankfurt was easier than expected and had a 2 hour break in the lounge - which again is big step up from before with nice food on offer. The A380 trip to Beijing was very pleasant. I'm not a fan of the seats arranged in pairs and your feet end very close to your neighbour and seat lacks privacy. Despite those issues, it was comfortable as a flat bed, and the food was again great and tasted fresh for a change. Cabin crew again lovely, smiling and seemed very engaged with passengers. Return trip was fairly similar, excepting long walks and very unpleasant Terminal 3 at Beijing. Would highly recommend.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-10-06; |  Frankfurt to Rio de Janeiro. I was badly impressed with the disorganization of the cabin crew.  They were really slow to serve breakfast and the process took like 2/3 hours.

lufthansa;2017-10-06;" |  Oslo to Malta via Frankfurt. This company apparently has good schedules, an okay product and okay service. The weak point is that I often experience changes in the flight times (I fly this route several times a year, and about 4 round trips a year on Lufthansa). The airline expects you to be understanding and accommodating, and doesn't give compensation when it causes its passengers inconveniences (like changing the departure time of its flights, or changing the aircraft type at the last hour and your booked and paid premium seat is no longer available). When you ask to be accommodated on another flight (like a later flight after a schedule change), Lufthansa provides a bunch of excuses. Their customer service call centres are a waste of time.

Crowded and old A320, with soon-disintegrating seats. Service was good, with delicious sandwich and German beer served in glass bottles. Extremely long transit walk at Frankfurt, nearly one hour gate-to-gate, with extremely rude security staff. Chaotic boarding at Frankfurt. One unacceptable thing onboard Lufthansa flights to Hong Kong is that all announcements are made in Mandarin (language in China) instead of Cantonese (main language in Hong Kong), except the safety video which makes the service inconsistent. Mediocre meal but served with wide range of beverages, including post-dinner drinks. The toilet became smelly and dirty only one hour into the 12 hour flight, without improvements during the rest of the flight. Extremely long wait for baggage at Hong Kong, 40 minutes after arriving at the baggage claim for the first priority bag and more than one hour for normal bags.";NEGATIVE

Our first flight was fine, walked straight from gate to the plane over the tarmac (no further than a normal airport gangway), greeted with a smile and a chocolate bar as we boarded. Only a short hop to Munich, drinks served and a scenic flight. Seats comfortable and enough leg room for a smaller plane. The change in Muuich was efficient and reached the connecting gate in plenty of time. Our next leg was delayed by 30 mins (overall), to be fair they did their best to make up time. Nice service onboard - salmon sandwich and a hot drink (cold drinks and wine available too). Friendly crew and really good leg room in row 5. Both flights virtually full - board and disembarking went with ease. No luggage issues. Lufthansa a very reliable airline once again, look forward to my next flight.";POSITIVE

Everything would have been ok but our flight from Vienna to Frankfurt was late and we ended up having only 25 minutes to get to the gate for our next flight. We were told by the crew when getting off the plane that the connecting flight would wait but we ran fast as we could anyway to get to the gate. Well they closed the gate in front of us and we missed the flight. Our next flight to Bydgoszcz was in two days. Luckily Lufthansa let us stay in a hotel near the airport for 2 nights and paid for the room, full board and got us tickets onto the next available flight without too much hassle.";POSITIVE

However, at Frankfurt airport the bag drop was all automated which was a horrible process for people not technically savvy. Many people were struggling to get to grips with the system. I'd rather deal with a human being rather than a computer. The flight was delayed by 20 minutes or so and gate changes were experienced from 15a to 16a then to 17a, all the time the changes were sent to my email address but I did not have my email connected. And furthermore not everyone has email! On boarding the aircraft the staff were pleasant and helpful, a contradiction from the airport security and police. In flight meal was very good but I didn't bother with any alcohol so don't know what was available. Overall a comfortable clean plane - no issues.";POSITIVE

No extra leg room, recline, upgraded bedding, IFE, power ports, no beverage service on the ground. No pre warning from LH of this subpar product otherwise we would have not been there.  FRA-MIA onboard A380 with a 2.5 hour delay. When leaving the lounge I asked the agent if all in order, 'yes' was the answer and we headed to our gate at 0945 just to be airborne at 1330. Returned to the lounge to find it packed, so back to the gate to wait there. MIA-FRA uninterested cabin crew, though polite, went thru the motions. We had to ask for everything we needed, as staff never came to check on us. Internet paid for but did not function. No mid flight snacks. Boarded a boiling cabin in the Florida heat to be told to wait till we taxi when the A/C will kick in - sweating for over an hour. My 6000EUR spent on those tickets were a total waste of money. The leg to TLV was as bad as the TLV-FRA, a journey in Economy. LH offered 200 Euro as comp for all the above hassles and discomfort. I let them keep it. ";NEGATIVE

The flight was full and we had the seats at the emergency exit. For this reason, the seat pitch on this specific flight is not representative for all seats but from our inbound flight on the same type of aircraft I as a 189cm person can say, that I had perfectly fitting legroom. We got served a nicely warm breakfast (egg, ham, potatoes) and drinks were served once after the breakfast and additionally the flight attendant served water before landing. The captain kept us informed about the journey and made us feel welcome on the flight. The only negative thing was the unorganized boarding process in LIS. We can recommend Lufthansa and hope to be enjoying them again soon.";POSITIVE

Long line of people queing to board not by row numbers, little delayed in leaving. Sat down the back by the tail, seat 93e. Short of crew on this flight for some reason, could clearly see the results as the service was slow and the crew function like robots, no smile, just doing the motions. Food standard fare nothing special, in-flight entertainment was bad, not much to choose from, not a good selection and the touchscreen was slow to respond. I prefer the Asian carriers as the service and crew are much more efficient and effective but this time I didn't have an alternative. Next time I will try to avoid Lufthansa just another average European carrier.";NEGATIVE

The entertainment system is far superior to the one of the Boeing 747-8. Food served was quite good, the wines were limited but adequate. The cabin staff was outstanding.

The cabin is very nice and the seats are also very nice, good full-flat foot space as opposed to the A340-600. But, there are no USB jacks or charging - mind-blowing in a new aircraft type. Also, the entertainment system features a screen that has not met pixels and a navigation page that is dismal. Service was efficient if not warm. The food was really lousy for business class. Even a salad was terrible. The contrast with our outbound flight to Munich could not have been sharper. We connected from Athens in Frankfurt and our flight was 55 minutes late. There was no one at the gate or anywhere to direct us or to say if our flight was being held for us. We ran for what seemed like miles until we hit passport control and a line of over 400 very irate travelers. Had it not been for our EU passports we would clearly have missed our flight. Never again through Frankfurt.";NEGATIVE

As a bonus a got free seat next to my seat. Food was standard (two sandwiches to choose) and set of beverages. Second leg was operated in the night by A321, so plane was almost empty (maybe 30% seats occupied). I got full emergency row exit just for me, thanks LH. Meal was hot and tasty. Plane was quite old but they keep it in good condition. On both flights ground and on-board staff was very friendly and helpful. At my final destination was delivered very fast.

I went to the counter, where I was told to wait for an hour until the additional information would be available. When I asked them to re-book my flight, they said that the only option would be to go to Vienna and then to figure out by myself how to get to Graz because most probably the company wouldn't reimburse me the money for the trip from Vienna Airport to Graz. I went back to the gate, got a 10-euro voucher, and was told to come back 45 mins later for the latest updates on my canceled flight. When I came back to the gate, the ground team announced that we were going to be taken to Vienna by a plane provided by a partner company (Austrian) and transported to Graz by bus. This sounded more or less as a solution, but we were then asked to wait until 5pm to get on the plane. I wanted to re-book and to leave to Vienna earlier but found out that the company would only provide one bus at around 6pm and that theoretically I could fly to Vienna earlier and then wait to everyone else. So, I arrived in Graz at 10 pm instead of 1pm which caused a shift in all my plans for the day. I tried to contact the customer relations service by email and never got a response.";NEGATIVE

Seats are comfortable enough, and similar to most other major airlines. The foods was really good, tasty and quite generous. Best was the cabin attendants who were all really nice.

lufthansa;2017-09-14;" |  I booked Lufthansa Business Class because I needed to sleep en-route in a quiet environment.  I paid 67,000 Miles & More points for this supposedly restful, relaxing flight and I selected seat 1A on the lower deck of the 747-400 because it is supposedly a secluded area of the cabin. I discovered that two noisy young children were seated together in seats 1H and 1K, with their parents seated behind in 2H and 2K. The parents ignored them and left them to make as much noise as they wanted on the 11½ hour flight. They were loud and uncontrolled, and their laughing and shrieking lasted the entire journey, as did their playing with their overhead and angle-poise seat lights in the darkened cabin. It was impossible to sleep with this behaviour going on. Why does Lufthansa allow young children in long-haul Business Class? Why couldn’t the children have been seated one per row by the window with a parent to control them? Lufthansa is responsible for whom they allow into their aircraft cabins and for making informed decisions as to whether their behaviour would upset or disturb other premium passengers. On arrival at the Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt  I was told that my flight LH936 to LCY had been cancelled. I went to the reception desk and they had no explanation for the cancelled flight and I had been moved to LH918 flying to LHR. This was annoying because I had arranged a business dinner close to London City Airport which also had to be cancelled.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-09-12;" | Flight from Seattle to Frankfurt, start afternoon in SEA, arrival early morning in FRA, so it was a night flight. Unfortunately, aircraft was a Boeing, thus seats much narrower than in an Airbus. Flight on time and very calm - usual, very good Lufthansa standard. However, cabin staff was not very attentive and sometimes even rude. Beverages were only rarely offered, collection of garbage even more rare. During the night, cabin staff went through the cabin with beverage trays, but did not look carefully if some passengers might be awake and wishing something to drink. About 2 hours before landing, I asked a cabin attendant who passed by with a beverage tray whether she could pick off my garbage, i.e. three empty cups. She said that she is not allowed to put garbage on a tray with food products (which I know) and she had other guests to care for. She would be back later. I asked when as I was aware that they would soon have to start serving breakfast before landing, and she said ""soon"". I did not want to talk too much or too loudly as most other passengers slept, just wanted to know whether the next collection of garbage would happen after the breakfast, whether it would make sense to go to the washroom before without disturbing the distribution of breakfast etc. Had a flight with Air Canada from Frankfurt to Calgary three weeks earlier, and they offered beverages much more often, and they also collected garbage. It was my first time that I experienced rude Lufthansa cabin staff, but other airlines do offer beverages much more frequently during long-distance flights, and they also collect garbage more frequently. Breakfast: only savoury, omelette with roasted bacon and onions. I prefer a sweet breakfast and hoped to get some sort of German breakfast on a flight to Germany with a German airline: some bread, butter, jam, maybe cheese and sausage or even some yoghurt. I am aware that an airline cannot fully respond to all customers' wishes, but a choice between a Northern American breakfast and a continental (German) breakfast would have been highly appreciated. Why not offering two choices as they do with the warm dinner (pasta or chicken)? I still recommend and choose LH for short-distance flights within Europe. First because of Lufthansa's safety standards, second because I can cope with some kind of thirst during short flights. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-09-10; |  Milan to Frankfurt. There was no group or seat boarding they just board everyone at one time!  At the gate when you are waiting to be scanned the lady stopped every person to weigh their luggage and see if it fits into their sample size bin. We took our laptop and camera out of our carryon and the weight works but she said we can bring it because it won't fit into the sample bin and she made us check it in. Ridiculous and this causes boarding longer delay because she stops everyone. At check in they didn't even seat my husband and I together even though the seat next to me is empty.;NEGATIVE

The food well, this was part of my meal: Tuna Tanaki (Fresh), fine vegetable salad (also very fresh) Arugula Pesto and Wasabi Crème Fraiche after they serve me Prawns in Crustacean Sause, Basmati wild and Camargue rice (what a great rice) with cream Spinach. Sometimes I ask myself why I don’t have a Senator Card.

Unfortunately it was too late to return. I started to panic as I had to catch a connection in Moscow bound for Hong Kong and all tickets, including the Lufthansa ticket to Moscow, were not allowing any changes - meaning I'd lose all tickets worth approx 2000 Euro if I weren't to get a hold of my passport somehow. I called the LH Senator hotline and they were just wonderful - they really went the extra mile in order to help or offer solutions. They even offered to change my non-changable tickets if it was of any help. Same for the ground staff at STR and FRA airport. Everyone envolved cared and showed the best customer care possible. In the end I had a friend fly from MUC to FRA to deliver my passport. With the help and care of LH my problem was solved and I could travel as planned. The flights were the same high level of quality as all Lufthansa flights. ";POSITIVE

GDN-MUC was operated by very small and thin CRJ-900 with very narrow cabin and standard Lufthansa service on regional flights. Anyway still there is a lot of space for legs. Second flight MUC-FRA took less than 1 hour and again I got some snack and set of drinks. Last flight was operated by double decker A380. Seats was comfortable with enough recline angle. Meals was surprisingly very good (it's not very common on Lufthansa flights). Plane was one of the oldest A380 in Lufthansa fleet, but in-flight entertainment system meets all today requirements, only headsets was very poor quality (plastic), so I was using my own headsets. USB charger in the armrest was working correctly. Unfortunately flight was fully occupied and I got quite big co-passenger so I had limited space (anyway it was not Lufthansa fault). Lounges in all airports was clean and well catered. This time 10 stars.";POSITIVE

I am a 24-year-old female from New York, and I traveled by myself for the first time for a friend's wedding. It was a terrible and exhausting trip. I missed my connecting flight and had an additional 6 hours of travel by train. Trying to get the train itself was a nightmare. I waited on four different lines in which staff refused to help me, and treated me without courtesy because I could not speak the language. I finally had to get help from a stranger from Dusseldorf who could properly convey what I needed. They lost my luggage, and it was not recovered for four days, a day after the wedding. I had to go to the airport to recover it and was told my lost baggage claim didn't exist and I was blamed for it being mishandled, and when I showed the staff that I had done it properly, they did not apologize to me, they just handed me a feedback card. I filed a feedback form and gotten confirmation that it was received, but it has been three weeks and I haven't heard a word! Everyone makes mistakes, but I feel this airline completely ignores you and doesn't own up to it's mistakes at all. ";NEGATIVE

Ground staff lady demanded I checked it because ""we have a full flight today"". I know it's the luggage-rules and Germans are strict. But looking at all the huge trunks being checked in, standing there with my tiny trolley +0.8kg? That had nothing to do with a full flight - just pure rigid rules - so I solved it by wearing my jacket instead of folding it in the trolley. Result was only that the line had gotten severely longer. Why did I even need to be in contact with ground staff? Because I couldn't check-in online in the first place! So much for promoting smooth travelling and being digital. ";NEGATIVE

Once arrived to Munich, we had to run to our gate as they were calling Last call to Washington while we were in passport control.

Our outbound flight LH935 to Franfkurt was cancelled which initially had me stressing but as soon as we called a number in the departure lounge, we got rebooked onto the next flight, LH937, it was same seats and no need to go out and reprint boarding card, they did it for us. City Airport take offs are dramatic but the flight whilst bumpy was run with good service, free food and drinks. It was late but this was due to the weather that had our previous flight cancelled, so fine, took off quick. On the inbound flight, Frankfurt airport also had bad weather, my luck. The inbound flight was 40mins late but it then was delayed another hour due to storms again. Same type of service, Flying out of City is expensive but I suppose that's because of convenience over price for business passengers, even though I am a leisure traveller. Would recommend.

Boarding was organized by Economy Class rows, which turned out to be very quick and efficient. The aircraft (an Airbus A340-600) was relatively clean and well maintained, as well as the seats. The seat was exceptional, which included an excellent headrest, a coat-hook, a seat pocket as well as an additional storage compartment for the safety cards and inflight magazines. A comfortable pillow and blanket were provided. The legroom was a solid 31 inches. A footrest was provided which made the seat just a tad more comfortable. The inflight entertainment system was very responsive and offered a decent amount of movies and TV shows to watch on this 11 hour flight. The flight attendants were very attentive and caring. They offered plenty of drinks and snacks, which is important on a long-haul flight in my opinion. The meal was outstanding. I took the pasta option, which was pretty good. Overall it was a fantastic flight. I would certainly fly Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE

FRA-DME an old 321 with no IFE, which is for me unacceptable for a 3hour flight. Meal service was chaotic, items constantly running out, but food was quite fine. DME airport a big mess. Long queues on passport control and people were taking baggage from the belt that did not belong to them. LED-FRA was disgusting food, chicken in a very smelly sauce that made whole cabin smell. Seat would not recline. Due to a 10min delay I missed my connection to PRG. No help whatsoever was offered at the airport in order to get from point to point faster. When I complained about this on transfer desk I got an arrogant answer that they can not take everyone by hand to airplane. Lufthansa never again.";NEGATIVE

The planes were new, the seats were reasonably comfortable for Economy class seats, and the service was attentive and friendly. On all flights, complementary hot and cold beverages and a small complementary sandwich were served. For the sandwich, there was usually a choice between a meat and a vegetarian option. The flights were on time, and the transfer at Frankfurt was smooth and easy. A few years ago, I took LH very regularly and thought that they had a decent standard. But I got the impression during this flight that they have taken the quality of their service to the next level. Will take them again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-08-13;" | Lufthansa LH2018 from Munich to Dusseldorf. Boarding was quick and the crew was very friendly. The aircraft was perfectly clean. As this was a very short flight, the crew handed out drinks and some crackers which weren't bad at all. This is something I really appreciate about Lufthansa. Even on flights not longer than 40 minutes, they are serving drinks and there is a full service, the only difference being that on a longer flight you would maybe get a sandwich while on a short flight it's crackers. Compared other airlines where you'd only see your crew on boarding and would have to call them and pay if you wanted something to eat, this feels much closer to the customer. The seat was very comfortable and having chosen one next to an exit meant that I had practically unlimited leg room.";POSITIVE

The crew were excellent and very attentive. Overall service and food was very good. We were served a cold platter with some German cheese and roasts. Dessert were some cookies and an unbelievably tasty orange and pistachio creme. The seat was the standard European short-haul business class seat you would expect, which is just a normal economy seat and an empty middle seat. But that empty seat certainly came in handy.

Boarding commenced on time and was able to push back on time, but delays on the ground caused the aircraft to take off late. The flight was uneventful. Cabin food was good, and the steward (there is only one in upper deck economy) was very happy to serve us. This is an attitude that should be emulated across airlines.

The lounge is comfortable enough for short haul usage, and a fairly nice spread of hot and cold breakfast food is available. What is annoying and strange is that Lufthansa still prioritise their Senator passengers over full fare business class - the Senator lounge has upgraded and better catering. So if I always fly economy with Lufthansa and am Senator member, I get more benefits than their true premium customers?

Victoria to Vancouver  20-minute connecting flights by Air Canada Jazz used Dash 8-Q400 turboprops. and Munich to Geneva by Air Dolomiti on Embraer E195. Vancouver to Munich on A330-300 aircraft. Air Dolomiti flights had comfortable seating, and featured a couple of different regional Italian wines on each flight. LH Premium Economy seating was 2-3-2 across (instead of 2-4-2 in economy), with an extra four inches of legroom (35-inch pitch). Extra legroom and footrest were welcome but seats were narrower than they ought to have been. Between the window-seat armrests and the fuselage was a 5-cm gap on each side of the plane, and all seats had tray tables in the armrests. The front row of Premium Economy also had IFE screens in the armrests – small screens half the size of those in the other rows. FAs were very good. Two meals were served, the main one after take-off, the second 1½ hours before landing. The meals seemed to be  regular economy meals – chicken or pasta options for the main meal – except that in Premium Economy they were served on porcelain and serving size may have been slightly larger. IFE was good, although films and TV shows were classified in unexpected categories. Outbound connection from YYJ through YVR is always easy because domestic passengers can remain on the secure airside to international flights without a further security screening at YVR. Connection through MUC was better than a year ago because, although you have to go through passport control entering the Schengen area, no extra security screening was required there either. Likewise on the return trip, no further security screening was required through MUC leaving the Schengen area. When entering Canada at YVR you have to go through Canadian Border Services inspection and collect your baggage but even at that point, for passengers connecting to domestic flights, they provide a dedicated area for onward baggage transfer and a dedicated security checkpoint. Despite connection times of only 1 hour to 1½ hours at YVR and MUC, both my bags arrived with me at the destination. The only hitch was that LH and AC use different booking codes. After booking my trip on the LH website I had to telephone AC to ask for the AC booking code, which I needed in order to do the initial check-in at YYJ.";POSITIVE

I have flown three times with Lufthansa in the past week, and every time I am very pleased to hear the sweet way captain talks to us, on my last flight he even told us a bit about what we're seeing outside of the windows!

lufthansa;2017-07-03;" |  We tried to check in together for our onward flight to Singapore. We originally had seats together on the TXL-FRA leg but we couldn't get seats together on the 12 hour long flight. There was no desk at which one could check in without a boarding card upon arrival so the woman told me to go to the gate and check in there. After waiting in a queue that didn't move for over an hour despite the desks being open (extra personnel arrived later), we got to the desk and the attendant couldn't check us in together and this time, on neither flight. The service was horrible. Currently we are waiting to depart and there is neither personnel nor plane at our gate when we are meant to fly out in 15 minutes with no update on how late the flight is.  The options for in flight entertainment were largely disappointing, even for bilingual passengers. The flight 2 weeks ago from HKG-FRA was 30 minutes late causing us to rush to make our flight from FRA-TXL (Berlin). The onboard and ground staff were unhelpful in trying to fast track us through to our next flight. I have never flown on a long haul flight without the rest of my party. On short haul flights it isn't an issue but in my opinion it is bad form to separate couples or families on a 12 hour flight.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-07-03; | Standard Lufthansa service from Munich to Tokyo - small space from forward seat recline. Toilets were not so clean at the beginning of the trip. Food variety not so wide. Two services for the whole trip of 11.5 hours and good movie selection. Small delay to take off however pilots caught up arrival time - reasonable for such a long trip.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-07-03;" |  Dublin to Bucharest via Munich. The most annoying part of booking a flight with them is that a one-way trip would cost the same if not more than a return trip. I paid 500 Euro for this ""Eco Light"" flight  and for this price, you are expected to pay 25 Euro extra for checked in baggage. They provide snacks and drinks on these flights, but I would prefer to pay less and not get the snacks. ";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2017-06-28;" |  Munich to Newark. After a short hop from VIE to MUC on a flight operated by Austrian, we had a quite tight transfer to our A340-600 for Newark. Even though the A340s are long, they still keep the passenger-friendly 2-4-2 abreast seating, which we as a couple really appreciated. Tha cabin is spacious, modern, the seats have everything one could need and the Lufthansa staff on this flight was gorgeous. We liked the idea of having the restrooms downstairs, especially for a little stretch on a long flight. The flight itself was smooth, food was decent, cabin crew very nice and friendly as mentioned and even in economy, there was a variety of drinks in the galley available throughout the flight, much appreciated! Overall a great experience with Lufthansa, it definitely is one of Europe's best airlines, highly reccomended.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-27;" |  I was due to fly from Marrakech to Istanbul today on Lufthansa and when I arrived at the check-in desk at Marrkech Airport they refused to allow me to check in, claiming that I required a visa to transit Frankfurt, despite the fact that Germany allows Transit Without Visa for Moroccan citizens and I had already transited Frankfurt on the same ticket with no problems when flying from Istanbul to Casablanca on Lufthansa just three weeks before. I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless. I recommend avoiding Lufthansa as it appears they don't care about connecting travellers and can leave you stranded at a whim even if you have the right documents for your destination.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-27;" | Although a very comfortable flight from Munich to Amsterdam, we were unable to bring aboard any hand luggage due to the size of the aircraft. Hand luggage was promised to be returned at the aircraft upon landing. When we landed however we were instructed by airport staff to move to baggage claim without support from Lufthansa personnel (there was nobody from Lufthansa at the gate). A group of us decided to stay behind and eventually got our luggage from Lufthansa but this caused a significant delay which caused me to miss my train. The people who had to wait for their luggage at the baggage claim had an even longer delay since their baggage needed to be transferred.";NEGATIVE

There's more leg room and the middle seat is left vacant to provide a little more space and privacy. These aircraft have no inflight entertainment. Boarding at MUC was orderly, onboard service was very good. Overall, a predictably Lufthansa experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-23;" |  First Class from San Francisco to Munich in an A340-600. Lufthansa's onboard First Class service is a model of efficiency and precision. The hard product is very good on the A340-600 but not as good as the one on Lufthansa's A380. The lady flight attendant tending to me was outstanding in every respect, and it shows the training Lufthansa provides for its premium cabin staff. The overall experience is one of comfort and understated luxury. Topping it all was the superb First Class lounge in Munich. The only weak link in the chain was the rather mediocre United Global First lounge that Lufthansa uses at San Francisco. That could change when United unveils its Polaris First lounge soon.";POSITIVE

The smartphone boarding pass is much better.";NEGATIVE

When they announced in Vancouver that the plane would be 45 minutes late, I was sure I wouldn't make it. However, in Frankfurt they had ground personnel waiting at the arrival gate and then transferring us directly to the connecting flight. This was very nice of them, especially since I had a car rental waiting on me in Zagreb, so it would be a lot of hassle to handle it if I were a few hours late. The flight from Vancouver to Frankfurt was enjoyable: comfortable seats, 2 meal services, and endless supplies of drinks in between. Had a lot of sleep time. The staff were quite friendly. The only complaint was that I couldn't use the inflight wifi on my iPhone at all, for some reason the website wouldn't load properly.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2017-06-13;" |  Edinburgh to Beijing via Frankfurt. Lufthansa provided a real masterclass in customer service on our flights from Edinburgh to Bejing. All aircraft on our outbound and return journeys were spotlessly clean. On the A380 to and from Beijing, the cabin crew were a delight: friendly, attentive, and hard-working - treating economy customers as if they were as valued as first class customers. We did pay extra to sit in the upper cabin, but on check-in were moved to the lower cabin, but were quite happy as we were given seats by the exits with extra leg-room. The in-flight catering was superb - two good meals on a ten-hour flight and snacks, and frequent runs with juice, water and red or white wine, as well as a full bar service with each meal. Plenty of choice on the entertainment system, with the latest films. All flights departed and arrived on time. One of the few long-haul flights I have actually enjoyed.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-13;" |  I flew from Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Both flights were excellent. The flight from Munich to Tbilisi is 3 hours and 30 minutes. The aircraft was clean and tidy. The cabin crew were attentive to passenger needs. As it was economy class, I should highlight that the meal was delicious and sufficient enough. Before landing, the crew members offered water as it was overnight flight and this was appreciated by passengers. Lufthansa is a great airline and I always consider flying them as the first choice.

Already At Check-in Lufthansa provides First Class service: If one wishes, a staff member guides you through the Fast Track in Security in Los Angeles to the Lounge, and if requested from the lounge into the plane. This service is very much appreciated, especially, when the special fast track building site is shut down due to power loss, as it happened to me and one is guided efficiently through the very long queue of regular security. First Cabin in on the main deck in the nose of the aircraft and very airy. The design is very nice, and very seat has still the beautiful and fresh red rose. The only disappointment is the small size of the screen and the quality of the bed (not the best flat bed is not the best in the industry. The offered caviar is of very generous size, food and wine in generell of very high quality. And the crew is just efficient, knowledgable and friendly of highest standard. All in all a very good first Experience in the sky.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-06; |  Frankfurt to Mumbai in First class. Extremely caring team of individuals and very personable. The meals were delicious and well presented. Whoever does the airline catering for this sector is doing a very good job. My career is in Hotels hence I tend to focus naturally on food and service and have to admit both were exceptional. The upkeep of the facilities were very good. The amenities provided were better than many other airlines I have experienced in the past. I generally don't make time for reviews but this was something I had to do this time round. Thank you for the experience. ;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-06-03;" | We flew from London to Mexico City via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. The aircraft was in a very good condition, however, the seats were the skinniest I have seen. First leg was very short so we didn't expect much as usual, however, the second leg was the longest we've felt on the plane. For an 11 hour long flight, we were served the first meal after 2 hours. I always order a special meal, but I regretted my choice as it was bland and tasteless. The second meal came an hour before landing and it was in a small box, not a full meal. For an 11 hour flight. They did serve drinks a couple of times in between the two meals, but we didn't want water the entire flight.  The attitude of the crew was alright. My screen was dodgy, so I simply didn't bother to watch anything. The price we had paid was more or less the same for any other airline that time.";NEGATIVE

Friendly and heartely, wished everyone ""Happy Easter"" and every child got a gift. For guests waiting by the door, she made a lovely small talk with them. The flight was on time and the service very great. The food was delicious. On this short flight we got a tray with salmon on cabbage, pork fillet on salad, two kinds of cheese, a choice on warm buns, butter, mousse with peach and raspberry sauce and a bar of chocolate. The beverage selection was fine. A great product, great crew, great service.";POSITIVE

The short flight to Munich on time and the service was very lovely. The food (Asparagus on a green dressing with pork filet, a choice on warm buns, butter, one dessert and handmade cookies) was very delicious. We arrived Munich more as on time. Also the flight from Munich to Barcelona went on time and we got great service. Again a delicious meal. The beverage selection was fine and staff of both flights very friendly. We arrived Barcelona also on time.";POSITIVE

Check-in was quick and easy, enough free seats to choose when you check in online 23 hours prior to departure. My luggage was too heavy (25.5 kgs instead of 23), but Lufthansa didn’t bother, which is a great plus. Inflight experience was good: great and sufficient meals, crew very attentive, caring and good interaction with passengers. Mixed experiences with inflight entertainment: on both flights the map didn’t work and the TV touchscreen was difficult to use (slow or no reaction). Choice of contets was good, though. Also the USB power port didn’t work properly and was uncoveniently located under the armrest, which couldn’t be moved. Except these details it was a good flight for a cheap price, so I would recommend Lufthansa.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-26;" |  Budapest to Montreal via Munich. I was going to upgrade to Premium Economy, but reviews said it was pretty much the same seat and food as regular economy. so, I didn't. Online check-in was easy using the booking code, but there was no option to upgrade. To find that out, I had to go to a service counter in Munich. Flight out of Budapest was late, but staff were apologetic about it. Boarding process in Munich was a bit chaotic, since they did not inform passengers about the pre-boarding document check (which seems redundant, since they are not Customs, and we all already went through customs). Staff on the flight were friendly and attentive. They re-arranged seats for a couple with an infant, so that they could use the bassinet in the first row. The woman who gave up her seat got a voucher to use for duty free. These are really nice touches that show they see their passengers as real people with real needs. Alcohol selection was excellent: sparkling wine, wines, beers, liquors, and cognac for after the meal. The meal was fine. I liked the chicken, and the real cutlery. The entertainment system is worth choosing Lufthansa over other airlines that are offering less for within $200 of the the price. There were hundreds of movies to choose from - from many different cultures. The system was really responsive and quick. The screeN is at least 25% bigger than the ones on Air Canada, and it adjusts to more angles. USB plugs were easily accessible, right beside the screen. Because I know that Lufthansa offers a consistently quality product, I've switched my airline loyalty program to Lufthansa for the future.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-23;" |  Washington to Birmingham via Frankfurt. This was my first experience with Lufthansa, products I experienced were Economy on the A319-100 and Premium Economy on A340-300. I opted to fly with LH as they offered both the best price for the overall trip and the most favourable times to work with my journey plans. I had initially planned to fly Economy for the entirety of the journey. however, the additional cost for a premium economy seat was so minor that it made sense to elect for the premium option. I made the booking using the LH website initially, which was fine, but then opted to manage my booking using the mobile app. The app I found to be very cumbersome and slow. It took some navigating to make simple amendments like seat choices or adding API/visa data.  I didn't have hold baggage for this journey so my exposure to ground staff was minimal. The first leg of my journey commenced at BHX. The check in process proceeded without issue. however there was a slight delay with boarding, and we departed 30 minutes late. This made me nervous given that I was meeting a connecting flight, however the cabin crew were friendly, informed us of progress and connection plans at all times. I was seated in 10A, and exit row seat with ample leg room. We were offered a basic snack (marble cake) and a juice/coffee. Service was expedient and pleasant. which is how I would describe all of the flight. After landing at FRA I proceeded to my next flight. Unlike many airlines there aren't many ground perks for flying PE with LH. no lounge access, no priority boarding. The enhanced comfort offered on board however is more than worth the cost. The PE seats on the A340 were akin to retro business class seats. Wide, with built in IFE and tray table, with a foot stand (I was in 10A again). I had an end of aisle seat which meant I was not reclined in to. The catering option offered with PE is the same as economy, served on China and with metal cutlery and a glass. It doesn't sound much but it in fact makes the experience considerably more pleasant. We were allowed use of the business class lavatories which was nice given the economy toilets were a good 15 rows back. The cabin crew overall were friendly and helpful. They seemed cheerful and willing to do as much as they could to enhance your experience. For the flight back I elected to pay to use the IAD Lufthansa BC Lounge. It cost a mere $35 and was worth every penny... however, it lacked some of the comfort and grandure usually associated with lounges. As an economy passenger I wasn't particularly fussed but If I was a BC passenger paying a flexi fare (i.e. a lot of money) I'd have found the lounge to be understaffed, A little untidy, and lacking in food options. The return legs were almost identical to the outbound. same aircraft, same seats, same comfort, friendly crew. The food on this occasion was served in tins, but this can be overlooked. Again the crew offered use of the business class lavatories which I appreciated. Overall my first experiences with Lufthansa were good. A great product, great crews, great service.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-16;" | Lufthansa has once again lived up to my expectations of a good airline. I had to make a last minute flight Philadelphia to Berlin via Frankfurt and found not only an excellent price but a very nice travel experience. The attendants were all very friendly, the entertainment monitors on board were all using new technology with nice touch screens - not like the ones you have to push so hard you bounce the person in front of you! The inflight entertainment could have a wider selection, but I don't expect so much. The vegetarian meals aren't the best but I appreciate that they give you real metal silverware, and that they aren't stingy with the drinks. Looking forward to flying with them again in the Fall.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-14;" |  Flew Lufthansa from London Heathrow to Barcelona via Munich. Prior to boarding I visited the LH Senator lounge Heathrow T2. Like the lounge with it's elegant and warm design and the great views on the tarmac. As it was dinner time a very nice selvection of different hot and cold dishes was served. Lounge catering is Do&Co so taste of food was excellent. Lounge was a bit crowded but seats available for everyone. Priority boarding was offered and boarding was smooth. Was greeted by name and a drink was offered. I had ordered a special meal which was good in quantity and good in taste. Crew asked at least 5 times throughout the 1.5 hr flight if one wished another drink. The crew, as on most Lufthansa flights, was again exceptional. Always smiling, enganging and caring. In Munich arrival and departure from the very nice satellite terminal in T2. Senator lounge there as well very nice, but food offer did not compare with their LHR lounge. Onwards trip to Barcelona was as good as the flight from LHR. Slept the first half of the flight and upon waking up was immediately asked if I wished to have my dinner, which I gladly accepted. The fare was very competitive and the experience was top class. Unfortunately no inflight entertainment through app available.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-06;" | Flight from Munich to New York JFK with Lufthansa. About 4 hours delay due to a technical problem detected while the aircraft was taxiing. Very poor information by the captain. Finally deplaned by stairs in heavy rain and after waiting for the buses for about 45 minutes. Change of aircraft and departure from another terminal at MUC, which has obliged us to pass again through passport control. Nothing offered by the airline during all these hours. Barely a cold apology. We didn't know then that the experience with Lufthansa could even get much worse : our in-bound flight from JFK to FRA was cancelled the day of departure. It seems that Lufthansa has become unreliable. Very average service. Distant and unfriendly crew. Very uncomfortable economy seats. Not very clean aircraft.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-05-06;" | I had the flight from Tbilisi to Paris via Munich. Both segments were truly pleasant flights. Lufthansa is always my first choice from Georgia to France as it offers the best service for reasonable price in economy class. The stopover in Munich is also pleasant as it is one of the best airports in Europe. The check-in and boarding were well organized in Tbilisi taking into account that the flight was full. The aircraft A321 was clean and tidy. The cabin crew were attentive to passenger needs. Lufthansa service is great. The hot breakfast was very quick and efficient. The meal was delicious (sweet pancake), good quality and sufficient enough which is rare nowadays in economy class. I definitely recommend Lufthansa for this route as the company offers excellent product.";POSITIVE

I haven't flown with LH first class for some years, choosing Emirates, Thai and SIA but on a routing to Mexico there is no way to go with them so I took LH again - what a disappointment. In comparison to the mentioned airlines the seating has practically no privacy, the seats and configuration (with an alibi ""privacy wall"" you can use) is similar to Business Class on some airlines. The food was good, the service was something between very good and inattentive. You have to pay for using the internet. LH are not offering free limousine service at start and destination. I was reading somewhere that Lufthansa is aiming for a 5-star-airline but with this product it will definitely not reach that level. ";NEGATIVE

Mid afternoon meal disappointing, consisting out of a fruit salad (ok), a hazelnut-chocolate bar (ok) and a toasted sandwich (not tasty at all). Slightly late arrival and long waiting time on ground, till the aircraft was at its stand. Overall an ok flight, but with room for improvements.";POSITIVE

The IFE was state-of-the-art with a big screen and a lot of (recent) movies, audio books, music options, live TV and games. The staff was great - very friendly, smiling and attentive! Lufthansa is usually a little bit more pricy than other airlines, but in my opinion you get a good value for your money. Overall a very competitive product! I hope Lufthansa will continue providing a premium product and not follow other airlines in becoming a budget airline.";POSITIVE

Lufthansa has to rethink the domestic Business Class product in my opinion";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-20;" |  London to Denver via Frankfurt. Flight and service onboard were good seat comfortable and food / drink more than adequate on a 9hr flight. Problem is at on line check in where system did not recognise existing Star Alliance passenger information and requested Visa rather than visa waiver meaning that seats can't be reserved and then at the actual check in it's not possible to seat families together. Next problem is at boarding which is total mayhem with economy class trying to board at once resulting in delays and a scramble for overhead locker space. LH take no account of Star Alliance status unless you are booked in First class. As this is the cheapest and most convenient flight on this route I suspect we will continue to use this airline and endure it's failings such as they are.";POSITIVE

The first thing to be highlighted that Lufthansa’s cabin crew are always exceptionally professional, polite and efficient. Here, I would like to express my appreciation to the crew which was on 20th March from LAX to MUC as the aircraft had problems with air conditioning system (it was cold like in Antarctica). The Chief Purser (chief flight attendant) was extremely helpful giving extra blankets, offering hot teas and being with passengers all the time. The flight attendant was extremely helpful/efficient as well. Lufthansa has excellent product and the company is very competitive as also seats, entertainment, and food are superb!

lufthansa;2017-04-18;" |  Dublin to Beijing via Frankfurt. Both outbound legs were uneventful despite an hour delay leaving FRA, arriving 20 minutes behind schedule into PEK. Found the Boeing 747-800 series a tad cramped for such a large aircraft. On the return leg our flight left PEK over two hours late due to only 2 of 3 runways being operational. The captain kept passengers well-informed during the delay as we'd been on the aircraft for quite some time. En route, due to the significant delay we discovered we would miss our connection to DUB. Staff onboard kept everyone informed as many connecting flights would be affected. We did indeed miss the DUB flight but we were put up in an airport hotel overnight in FRA with dinner & breakfast provided. Impressively, we informed of this and the new flight arrangements a number of hours before landing into FRA. The next morning we were flown to Oslo and then onto Dublin with SAS (Star Alliance) as all FRA-DUB flights were fully booked for Easter weekend. The first time flying with Lufthansa and was very impressed with the cabin crew, pilots, checkin staff and gate & rebooking staff as we were a 50-strong school group and they dealt very efficiently and professionally with our concerns around the delay and missed connection. Food was frequent and decent for Economy class and the entertainment system was very good also. The Wifi service was disappointingly slow and not worth the €17 for the 9 and a half hour PEK-FRA flight. However, I do look forward to flying with them again in the future..";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2017-04-15;" |  I recently flew from Manchester to Atlanta via Frankfurt and back with Lufthansa. I was travelling as part of a group and so decided to book a seat to be close to friends. I was surprised that on a flight that cost nearly £1000, I would have to pay to choose my seat but I decided it would be worth paying £20 each way per person for myself and a companion to ensure that we sat together (£80 in total). The first issue I had was that the seats we were given on the flight from Frankfurt to Atlanta and the return leg were not the ones I had booked. We ended up on the very rear row of seats but we were at least sat together. On both flights (10 hours) we were served vegetarian food because apparently Lufthansa only offer chicken to those toward the front of those the plane. To make matters worse, I was later offered a hot dog for lunch, because they had run out of pizza. The hot dog was still completely frozen. I didn't make a fuss, I thought that I would get a refund for the seats and that would be the end of it. The flight itself was comfortable and smooth so I wasn't too unhappy until I spoke with Lufthansa customer services. They told me that the seat booking fee is non refundable and that booking a seat only entitles you to that ""type of seat"" and does not mean you will be sat in the seat that you chose when you made the reservation. So ultimately I have paid for a seat that I didn't get, I had the same type of seat as everyone in economy and yet they refuse to give me the £80 back.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-11; |  New York to Frankfurt. Excellent service and food and inside flight nice and clean. Wide comfortable seating but entertainment not good enough need more films and music options. Indeed lives up to its name of Lufthansa - a great way to fly. The crew were smiling and willing to assist to passengers! Wow had a great journey. ;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-11;" |  Flew the biggest bird in the sky, the A380 from Singapore to Frankfurt. Flight time 12-13hr. Food: couldn't be any worse. Mini portion, tasteless portion. That first meal was aprox 90min after take off. For the next 8hrs, nothing, zero. Ok let's kill some time with IFE aka inflight entertainment. So slow, awful menu, movie selection is a joke. Time for the toilet. But what's that queue? Oh that's just aprox 300 people sharing 4 toilets, so you need to wait 10-15min to get in. Finally meal 2 or should I say desert, some cake with a piece of bread and jam. I forgot the part about placing the IFE remote control in the armrest, simply brilliant. Accidently pressed button around 25 times. Never again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-09;" |  Flew Geneva to Johannesburg via Frankfurt. The Premium Economy on Lufthansa's B747-800 is strangely squeezed between a mini Economy cabin in the front and the main Economy cabin in the back. There are no separating walls or curtains, which kinds of defeats the ""premium"" feeling (therefore, the 2 dedicated toilets are used by everybody). The seating configuration is 2-4-2 (vs Economy 3-4-3). The seats are wide and recline well, but the foot rest is not well thought out for people over 180cm. The food is basically the same as economy, with an extra dish and served on real china and glasses (but Lufthansa's food offering is good in all classes anyway). Would I book it? Only if the price difference is minimal at booking. Best is to book the cheapest economy and ask for a 299 euro upgrade at checkin or gate in Frankfurt (which is a really good deal on very long flights). Avoid middle/window seats, as it is difficult to get out if your neighbour sleeps. My rating for ""value for money"" is based on the gate upgrade price.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-08;" |  Johannesburg to Basel via Frankfurt. You get a solid product at a decent price. The food was of good quality (may be on the small side for a guy my size), and unlimited bar and snacks during the flight (unlike BA). The service was excellent, and the plane was kept clean during the whole flight. Good choice of movies and TV shows as well. I did not like the Boeing 747-8: it is a new generation of aircrafts, but it feels like Boeing rushed it to the market to counter the excellent A380. It is a noisy aircraft, and none of the Boeing 787 technology was introduced on the B747-800. Also, on both ways, the cabins were freezing, and the crew told us that the temperature was set to maximum.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-03;" |  Flew brand new Lufthansa A350-900 from Delhi to Munich with a connecting Lufthansa A340-600 to LAX. The economy seat on Lufthansa A350 was uncomfortable. I turned on the Flyrobics channel, but wasn't able to do much stretching due to lack of space. The IFE on A350 was more responsive than the one on A380. The USB port is conveniently located near the monitor. The sound quality was very good, but the Flight Attendants take the headphones away 30 minutes before landing. Wi-fi did not work on A350 during parts of DEL-MUC journey. On the MUC-LAX segment, I found the A340-600 to be a more comfortable experience than A350. The food selection on MUC-LAX segment was very nice.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-04-03;" |  Flew Lufthansa A380 on Los Angeles - Frankfurt - Delhi route. Since I had done online check-in and had boarding passes, I just needed to do a baggage drop-off. Unfortunately, Lufthansa did not have a baggage drop-off counter at LAX. On-board, the A380 cabin was very quiet. The 31 inch seat pitch does not seem adequate once the passenger in front of you reclines their seat. The food quality on Lufthansa was very good on both segments, but the service was even better on FRA-DEL route. I purchased full day wifi pass and it worked all the way from LAX to DEL. USB port kept my cell phone charged throughout the journey, but the USB port was inconveniently located under the armrest.";POSITIVE

I got the information by sms a day earlier. It took some time to contact customer services, as due to the strike all lines were rather busy. My flight was changed to the next day via Frankfurt. They were very efficient, friendly and helpful. As I had to stay the night in Vienna, they even covered the costs for the hotel! I was very glad and appreciated their support. Lufthansa may be not the best in terms of food, seats etc. However, in case of something extraordinary, I am sure that I can rely on them. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-03-26;" |  My flight from Leipzig to Belgrade via Frankfurt was delayed for one hour, so they made a change to fly via Munich, so that I could make my connection flight to Belgrade. The Munich flight was delayed for 45 minutes, so I have 10 minutes for connection on Munich airport. Cabin crew didn't make any effort to give me some information or contact someone on gate. I made it after running to the gate. And in the end, I am arriving to Belgrade, and my baggage is mislaid. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-03-21;" |  I was very inconvenienced when they cancelled flights from Oslo to Berlin via Frankfurt on which I was booked, due to industrial action. I have also experienced several ""rescheduled flights"", which were an inconvenience, but they were quite accommodating with rebooking me onto alternative convenient flights. It so happened that a trip to Malta this year got one of those ""rescheduled"" flights. This time, I did get rebooked onto alternative flights to my liking, however, I it was a nightmare... with several emails, phone calls, a visit to the airport in Malta (only to be told to call their call centre in South Africa. To cut a long story short, Lufthansa keeps stooping lower even when you thought it had reached rock bottom. I've come to the conclusion that flying Ryanair is probably better than flying with Lufthansa (maybe, cheaper too).";NEGATIVE

Overall a very pleasant experience: Separate fast-track security for business class passengers at Munich airport, the Schengen business lounge at MUC´s Terminal 2 satellite nice and convenient, boarding on time with priority boarding respected, aircraft interior well-kept and clean, take-off on time. Lufthansa offers a three-course meal with a choice of to main courses on MUC-MAD sector. We tried chicken, a bit overcooked but still above average for airplane food. Comfortable seating with a free middle seat and good legroom. Lufthansa´s main asset is it´s cabin crew who are always friendly and service-minded and greet you by name. To be recommended.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-03-13;" |  Frankfurt to Bucharest. Newer aircraft. Boarding on time but a little chaotic. Leaving at time, arriving about 20 minutes early at destination. Full drink service and a sandwich (turkey or cheese) on the flight. Nothing special, so I skipped the food. Was able to read in an journal I could download on my iPad. Good idea, although the link was not working at first. I got what I had paid for.";POSITIVE

Having passed the efficient and surprisingly curteous security checks at Barajas Terminal 2 we went to the Puerta de Alcala Schengen lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Boarding in Barajas efficient and on-time with priority boarding respected. Aircraft interior clean and well-kept as usual, take-off on time. The cabin crew on this flight was particularly cheerful, good-humoured and service-minded, and the food (three courses with a choice of two main dishes, tried the fish, delicious) was even better than on the inbound flight. Unfortunately, coffee was entirely devoid of taste. Landed in MUC on time with good information about arrival procedures and connecting flights. To be recommended.";POSITIVE

Service interrupted without getting a glass of water due to mild turbulence. One wonders what justifies the price paid for the ticket? Unless I have no other alternative, I will not fly this airline again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-03-08;" |  Rome to Lisbon via Munich was a very good experience with Lufthansa. Crew on both flights were engaging, warm and caring. The cabin feels elegant, flights left on time, catering has improved and quality of food is very good. On the Munich to Lisbon flight, menu cards were handed out and provided a choice of 3 mains which all looked good, both in quantity and quality. Presentation of the food was good. Drinks were offered several times and a swiss chocolate bar was given to acompany coffee or tea. The intra-european entertainement system was available using the E-app which is very nice. Only little minus is the slightly hard seat cushion which could be softer, room offered is sufficuent though. Would recommend.";POSITIVE

I was checking my booking when I received a message with a deal to upgrade from economic class to executive, since the deal appeared to be good I entered all my card details to upgrade, I confirmed and never got a confirmation email with any reference. Instead what I got was a cancellation message. I rang the company straight away and the person that I talked to told be not to worry as the confirmation could take a little longer but that the flight was fine. Now after a week I been calling the company to confirm that my flight is ok and they told me that my flight has been cancelled. No money returned to me, no upgrade was made nothing. I am very disappointed as I made all preparations for my holiday and now I don't know what to do.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-03-02;" |  Munich to Cologne return in Business Class. The return fare was more than 700€, the service was mediocre at best. Although there was plenty of time for the flight attendants to conduct the service on this 1 hour flight, they did not ask the passengers whether they would like to have a second coffee or juice with breakfast. Even worse was the experience with the return flight. My meetings in the Cologne area finished early, I hoped to be able to change my fight to an earlier one without any additional charge. However I got told that I would have to pay another 50€ although the Business Class on those earlier flights was half empty. This brought the fare to more than 750€ for a round trip with 65 minutes flying time. ";NEGATIVE

When buying online I did not notice that my stop in Japan had an arrival and departure from two different airports in Tokyo. No transfer information provided. Had to change 26€ to Japan currency and transfer my luggage in a 1:10hr bus trip. No reply from Lufthansa to my 3 complaints. I would expect the airline is responsible for all the transfers between flights, including my luggage.  In my opinion Lufthansa has not given me what I thought I had bought.";NEGATIVE

I was forced to return promptly for personal reasons and I contacted the company for a change of date of return. My return was on March 7, 2017. The customer service assigned me a file number by mail and I'm still waiting for their news! I had to buy an emergency ticket on another company to go back to France. No customer follow-up from Lufthansa is deplorable. I still have no news from them and I've been home for 15 days! They are ticket sellers, only.";NEGATIVE

I was really disappointed by the lack of care of the crew.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-25;" |  Marseilles to Manchester via Frankfurt. First time on the A320 NEO. Enjoyed both flights but there seems to be a complete lack of organization at European airports during boarding, both flights allowed the usual business class & gold card holders priority boarding but then its a free for all with everyone vying for hand luggage space and blocking the aisles which in turn delayed the flights.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-22;" |  New York JFK to Frankfurt. My wife and I were seated in 32E/F (middle of centre 4 seating with our backs up against the toilets and galley). There was no way of reclining our seats and very little leg room. This was bad enough for a 7.5 hour flight but as soon as we were in the air the passengers in front of us reclined their seats, the backs of their seats came back to very near our faces. Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down. While this was going on the toilets further up the plane were doing business as usual. Don't the cabin crew care about the health of passengers? ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-20;" |  Hong Kong to Berlin via Frankfurt. Very friendly staff at check in, flight good, the food and seat were good, transit good, and very friendly cabin crew.

But as the time is moving, the internal issues are creating havoc and inconvenience. Because of their pilot strike I lost money and had to cancel my booked plans. Even though they re-book my flight, it was again cancelled and lastly they gave me a seat on Ethiopian Airlines which is not the same standard. I have decided to move to Gulf carriers (Etihad or Emirates) as they have more convenient and better system to work with their passengers.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-17;" |  Frankfurt to Delhi. This was my first time to fly Premium Economy Class - and certainly not my last time. The surcharge compared to regular Economy was moderate but the space and comfort level considerably higher. I was able to stretch my legs. The seat was also broader and more comfortable. In addition, there were some extras like a welcome drink, a menu and an amenity kid. While I would not describe the food as being superb it was tasty (choice between Indian vegetarian and Western non-veg). The A380-800 is a wonderful and exceptionally quiet aircraft, especially in the front part, where the Premium Economy seats are located. The cabin there also had a more secluded atmosphere. The plane looked very new and was in good condition. The tray could have been cleaned more thoroughly before boarding, though (in Frankfurt as well as in Delhi). The service was attentive and friendly on both flights. Last but not least: Both flights were on time or even slightly ahead of the scheduled arrival time.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-16;" | I took Lufthansa flight LH457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt as the first leg of a trip to Warsaw. For this flight, Lufthansa uses the standard A380. I sat in seat 11D (middle row) in the upper deck. The first thing you feel in boarding this aircraft is that Lufthansa is efficient, courteous and professional. The cabin is clean if not a bit bland, but overall has a comfortable feel to it. The configuration is a 2-2-2, so the middle row is the best bet, as each seat is an aisle. The seats are comfortable and are lay-flat. My only issue is that the controls for the seat are touch and therefore, if you are resting your arm on the armrest, you seat tends to ""readjust"" itself if you brush against the controls. In the lay flat position, the seats are typical of most airlines as they are not exceedly wide, like Singapore Airlines, and narrow for the footwell. One issue is that your feet land on a ledge on the bulkhead which has only a small divider between your feet and your neighbors. Often during the flight, I was awoken as my seatmate changed position and her feet brushed mine. A minor inconvenience, but for some may be too creepy. The service on the flight was very good, if not at the personal level of some of the Asian competitors. The food was decent, but not exceptional and misses the touches of other airlines like ANA, Singapore or even Austrian. The in-flight entertainment is very good. The TV screens are large, clear and easy to see both in the dark and with the cabin lights on. The screen is operated by touch or a remote. You have a massive amount of choices and they seem to have many of the latest movies. Overall, the flight does what it is advertised to do. It gets you there safely, comfortably and in timely manner. There are no surprises with Lufthansa.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-15;" |  Inter-Europe Business Class is always a disappointment and Lufthansa's A319 is no exception. This flight was LH1348 between Frankfurt and Warsaw and although it is a relatively short flight, it is always connected with a long-haul to Frankfurt, so after 10 hours of flight-time, being crammed into coach seats is never welcome. If you have not flown Inter-Europe flights, most airlines do not have a separate business class configuration. They use coach seats and then do not book the middle seat. The service is upgraded in these seats, but you are basically being wedged into coach seats at a business class price. As always, though, with Lufthansa, this flight was friendly and efficient with timely service, a decent meal and no surprises.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-14;" |  Frankfurt to Hamburg. Boarding began in time and we were welcomed by seasoned crew member handing out crisp packets (25 grams). The flight was fairly light and I had a row for me. The aircraft was clean and legspace,  with recaro seats, enough for short haul flights. After airborne full bar service. Lufthansa puts higher emphasis on drink service. If they can combine this with proper snack service, it would be great as not all passengers are into drinking alcohol. A warm bread roll would be a good option. One more point is Lufthansa should soon introduce zone wise boarding. This avoids long and unwanted queue inside dock channel and waiting inside aircraft for passengers to settle. Otherwise, Lufthansa is a reliable airline.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-13;" | Riga to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Flight took off 20 mins late. The onboard product was quite good. Cheerful and helpful crew. After take off they handed out sandwiches. The quality of sandwiches are way better than that served last year on same sector. And finally they heard the flight of vegetarians, eggless sandwiches. Later, full bar service with two rounds, appreciated by many. Leg space was usual with recaro seats, comfortable for short flights only. LH has introduced an app which can be accessed via wifi once in air that enables you to see videos, read papers, magazines, play games and gps service. Don't forget to download the app on your phone! Overall, I am impressed by Lufthansa.";POSITIVE

Walking fast, it took me 25 minutes with automated passport control. If you have to change between Schengen and Non-Schengen flights, FRA airport is not convenient. Boarding late about 25 minutes, takeoff about 20 minutes, due to a medical transport with this plane and the loading of the patient took a while. Flight eventless. Full drink service, rather dry sandwich. Arriving 5 minutes late in Bucharest. Baggage delivery rather fast for OTP. Again a recommendation in regard of the price I paid  it was about a fifth of what I paid 1999, when I started to fly regularly to OTP";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-11;" |  Munich to Montreal. I checked in online and had no luggage so bypassed the counter all together. At the gate, I discovered that they gave the same boarding pass, with my name, to my colleague. This was most unusual considering at check in they would have had to match my colleagues boarding pass to the name on his passport. Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep. IFE was mediocre with a sparse selection of new releases. The FA serving my side of the aircraft was friendly and courteous. Flight left slightly late but arrived on schedule. This was my second flight in Lufthansa's business class in less than a month and I am starting to think they are cutting corners. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-02-08;" |  Frankfurt to Rome return. Both flights were delayed about 30 minutes because of late arrival of the incoming flight. When I checked flight status on LH’s website I found out that many Rome flights were delayed. Lufthansa should work on punctuality of Rome flights. Except from this the rest was pretty good. Good sandwich and full bar service for free, great staff from check-in to FAs, cabin clean and in good condition, seats and seat pitch were ok. Lufthansa offers a good product with high standards on European routes. ";POSITIVE

Newark to Frankfurt was on the new Boeing 747-800, even got a bulkhead seat with extra legroom at no extra cost. Chicken meal was quite decent, with frequent drinks offered, and you could pop back to the galley for an extra beer, whiskey, or whatever. Frankfurt to Krakow offered a small pretzel, along with beer, wine, tea, coffee. Warsaw to Munich was delayed but otherwise okay, tasty turkey sandwich with beer or wine. Munich to Newark was also delayed, which was good for me as I otherwise wouldn't have made it because of the delay in Warsaw. Delay was handled well, food vouchers given out. The rest of the trip uneventful, had a nice pasta and plenty of sparkling wine, beer, gin, tonics. Very friendly FAs, always happy and eager to serve extra drinks and snacks. Great entertainment systems on both trans-Atlantic flights, with lots of music and movie choices. LH really is the best airline in Europe.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2017-01-24;" |  We flew Lufthansa business class from Barcelona to Munich on January 15, 2017. Apart from some minor ""beauty defects"", none of which turned out to be Lufthansa ´s fault, the flight was uneventful and quite pleasant. We spent some time at the ""Sala Pau Casalls"" business lounge which is a total let-down (see my separate review). Boarding was unpleasant because the announcements were totally incomprehensible and the Airport Operator AENA seems to be finnicky about hand baggage sizes. They refused to let me take my trolley bag onboard because, despite the fact that it has the required dimensions, it expands when it is fully packed. They didn´t mind about that at MUC but they do at BCN. My bag was checked in and arrived on the same flight as myself in MUC, so no major disaster, but you have to be aware of the situation. The business class experience on this flight was pretty much the same as on the inbound MUC-BCN flight - friendly and attentive staff, good food and drinks, good legroom etc, but our A321 was older than the A320 on the inbound flight and had a sort of fixed tray table spanning the free middle seat which is unnecessary and uncomfortable. There is no inflight entertainment except via the downloadable LH app, which some people will object to, but I don´t. The flight took off almost on time and landed punctually in MUC despite the nasty winter weather. Baggage claim was surprisingly fast for MUC standards.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-24;" |  We flew Lufthansa Business Class from Munich to Barcelona on January 8, 2017. Our flight was supposed to leave from Munich's new Terminal 2 satellite building so we arrived early to spend some time at the Star Alliance Schengen Business Lounge which turned out to be a nice experience (see my separate review). Munich right now is going through a phase of Siberian winter so we were prepared for delays, and the boarding time got rescheduled from 12:30 to 13:25 because ""your flight crew didn´t make it to the airport on time"". Funny, because everybody else did despite the snow. During that time the departure gate was changed four times and we ended up having to go back to landside Terminal 2 via the underground people mover to our final departure gate which was totally overcrowded. Boarding started ten minutes past scheduled time which is not a drama but a bit of information would have been nice, but wasn´t forthcoming. Boarding was swift but we then got bussed around the entire airport to a remote stand off Terminal 1 which LH doesn´t even use. Our A320 with sharklets looked brand-new but had apparently been standing around all night in the open and was covered in snow, so after being seated by our very friendly cabin crew the captain came on the interphone to tell us that ""winter has hit us full-blast"" (no explanation or apology for turning up late to work), and that it would take a few minutes to remove snow from the engine inlets and perform the de-icing. In fact we didn´t take off before 16:00, with no further information forthcoming from the flight crew. Obviously, delays are to be expected in the wintertime, but the lack of information is annoying. The flight itself was enjoyable and uneventful, and we landed in Barcelona around 17:30 with apologies for the delay from the flight crew. The Lufthansa cash upgrade from economy to business on European flights is worth the money in my opinion even if LH European business class is technically speaking a premium economy product. But the legroom is pretty good, the seats are quite comfortable and the free middle seat plus foldable armrest improve seating quality no end. The staff are very friendly and attentive, the food is surprisingly good and the hot bread rolls are a nice touch, china and metal cutlery are appreciated and they offer as many hot and cold drink services as you like, and the look of the cabin was new, neat and clean. Flight announcements were sufficient and comprehensible and came in four languages. All in all, I would recommend flying LH business class on European routes, and I would recommend that LH improve their ground services in MUC.";POSITIVE

Lufthansa's Business Class product is looking jaded and mediocre and no longer feels like a premium experience. A reason is the terrible seat layout with little privacy and the cabin feels and looks crowded. The B747 seats are slightly more comfortable than the A380 with better space around the seats. The onboard service is good, the flight attendants well-trained and efficient. The wifi service was highly unreliable and the $20+ fee seems a rip-off when there are so many breaks in service. The business Lounges in FRA were crowded, and boarding was botched with broken lines and no clear direction.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-22;" |  Edinburgh to Johannesburg via Frankfurt. This was our first time flying with Lufthansa for quite a few years, and overall we had an excellent journey. The A320 flight from Edinburgh in business class had seats in a 3x3 configuration with the middle seat empty, the seat pitch was fine for the short flight to Frankfurt. The crew were very good, using our names, and we had a lovely light meal with a couple of drinks. To JNB we were in the upstairs section of the 747-800 which has 36 seats, again the crew were very good, and the food service for a 22.00 departure wasn't rushed, and the choice of wine and food were excellent. The breakfast after a decent few hours of sleep was served an hour or so before landing, and again it offered a decent choice of food with good coffee. The return flights were every bit as good as the outbound, again the cabin crew were very good, introducing themselves when we were seated, and using our names whenever we talked. After a very nice dinner, and watching a couple of up to date films it was time to settle down for a few hours sleep. After another good breakfast we landed on time at Frankfurt, and then made our way to terminal B for our flight back to Edinburgh on another A320.

What I got was a bland vegetarian meal for dinner and breakfast. The whole idea of ordering a Non-Vegetarian meal is to not get a Vegetarian Meal and not whatever the catering division decides so give me. It wasn't even Hindu or Asian in flavor! Why does Lufthansa bother to offer a specific Hindu Non-Veg Meal if in reality does not provide such a meal? The flight attendants were wonderful on board and did what they could. But they could only offer me yet another Non-Meat Pasta Meal because the other one offered was a Fish Meal which I do not eat at all.  The food was the same as in regular economy class only served on china. The snacks for a long haul international flight was the same packet of pretzels offered with the pre-dinner drink and nothing more! Not that many years ago Lufthansa offered sandwiches, cake and fresh fruit and other nice things for snack on in long haul flights even in economy class! Seats on the A380 were hard and not that comfortable though leg room and seat width was good. Inflight Entertainment was also good. Lavatories kept clean but offered no amenities and were cramped in size. ";NEGATIVE

This aircraft does not have any special business class seats, but the central seat is always free for your comfort. The staff were friendly and first you got something to drink, then a light meal (we started at about 2 p.m.). Later on some more drinks, as you like. When checking in or before you can download your e-journal but also during flight you got some papers and/or journals. The aircraft was in time at the destination and the lounge in Munich (new satellite terminal) was good. You got drinks, wine, coffee, spirits warm and cold meals, newspapers, free Wi-Fi etc.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-17;" |  Flew Lufthansa from Tucson to Chennai - no delays. I got to my destination on time. However, while travelling from Houston to Frankfurt, the air hostess was very rude to me. An air hostess asked me to switched seats so that a family could sit together. Because of this, I had to take my bag to the upper deck. Unfortunately, there was no space available in the overhead bin and the air hostess gave me a hard time. I felt as though it was my fault for agreeing to help out. My return flight to Tucson was even worse. Due to a delay, I missed my connection from Frankfurt to Houston. I had to wait in the customer support line for over 3 hours while they tried to figure out what to do. I was finally re-booked (UA 59) on a flight that left 26 hours later than my scheduled flight to Houston while I knew for a fact that there were seats available on flights that left to the United States from Frankfurt. I was given 30 euros worth of meal vouchers. They didn't give the passengers without a transit visa a proper lounge to rest in. Their exact words were: ""We will give you some blankets and pillows. Please sleep near the gates in Terminal B"". Due to fatigue, I failed to realize that I just had 1 hour at San Francisco to clear my customs and catch a connecting flight to Tucson. As expected, I missed my connection but United re-booked me on a flight to Tucson in less than 3 minutes.";NEGATIVE

Our plane was delayed due to weather fair enough, but then we were stood on the tarmac for over 45 minutes as they boarded customer who then decided to not fly on that flight so their bags had to be taken off. As the flight was delayed this should of been sorted out earlier as there was plenty of time to do so. We had to get a connecting flight which meant it was going to be close whether we made it or not. However when things settled down, and I pressed the assistance button not 1 member of staff showed up, therefore I had to go looking for help. When I finally asked they were less than welcoming with the vaguest of answers about us making our connecting flight. Luckily we made the flight with minutes to spare. We asked for a snack before our inflight meal but nothing was available. Again staff were not helpful and kept offering us drink which was of no us to use and meant we had gone 8 hours with nothing but a sandwich on the last flight. Upon arrival in Incheon we found out that our luggage had not made it to Incheon. We again were treated appallingly no apology or offer of compensation.";NEGATIVE

Cabin crew very attentive, good selection of amenities on Lufthansa Y+ class. The meals were all very tasty, I ordered low fat meals and was impressed. German sparkling wine was on demand and available all throughout the long haul flight. I walked the whole lenght of the lower deck cabin and it is imprepssive how spacious is the A380. Even with the 3-4-3 config in Y a man could walk through the aisles without bumping into a shoulder of those seated. That plane is just a marvel. Very good experience.";POSITIVE

On time flights and prompt luggage delivery ensured this was a flawless journey.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-10;" |  Munich to Sofia. The Lufthansa return flight ruined an otherwise perfect holiday. Flights were late on both legs of the journey. On the outgoing flight the explanation given was that the crew had arrived late the previous night and had to use up their 12 hour day rest, so the next day flight was delayed. Our return flight was cancelled 40 minutes before scheduled takeoff. Of course no explanations given, but considering that most other flights were departing on schedule it must not have been the weather. We were quickly rebooked to another flight 4 hours later. 30 min before takeoff that flight was delayed by 1.40 hours, so by the time we boarded we had almost 6 hours of delay. The flight did not depart at the newly announced time either, since doors closed more than 40 minutes later and by the time we were airborne it was another hour late. The flight itself was ok and apparently we made up for some of the delay. Little did we know that after landing we would have another hour of delay, this time waiting for our luggage. The crew's bags were delivered earlier but the passengers had to wait until 1.20 am to get their bags, with noone from Lufthansa or the ground handling operator to explain what was going on. So instead of getting home at 6 something p.m. the previous day we got home at almost 2 am on a Monday - not ideal if you have to go to work at 8.00 am (wish I had the ability to delay my start of work for the 12 hours rest, like the Lufthansa crew).";NEGATIVE

Following a smooth check-in we proceeded to the lounge which was sweltering hot and had a very poor selection of food and no cold drinks. The departure was delayed due to late arrival of inbound aircraft and further delayed due to late boarding. However, there was no explanation for the reasons of delay or an apology from the cockpit. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept. It was the European business class configuration with the middle seat of economy style seating left vacant. The FA's were friendly and efficient which was the only redeeming feature of this journey. The food was below acceptable for Business Class and a huge letdown for LH. As expected we were late arriving in Munich and it took over 1 hour from the time we reached our gate for the bags to be delivered. Aside from the FA's, this flight was well below expectations especially considering the price paid.";NEGATIVE

Very clean and comfortable flight. Thanks Lufthansa you set new parameters of hospitality.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-07;" |  Chicago to Moscow via Frankfurt. Extremely miserable experience from business class travel.  Our flight from Chicago was delayed due to some technical problem with the aircraft. Ok, I get it, troubles happen. We had to wait 2 extra hours in a rather miserable United lounge in Chicago. On the aircraft in 2 toilets out of 3 in business, the toilet seat was not holding itself while opened - meaning you have to hold it. When the aircraft was landing some of the next flights were announced to be rebooked, but neither my flight, nor my husband was. Even though there were some flights departing after our flights, we were not announced to be rebooked. When we came out of the plane, there was a service person from Lufthansa answering questions. My husband was guided to the service desk and to me the men standing there said: ""if you run you can catch your flight"". It was 9:30 am and my initial flight LH1444 was boarding at 9:15 in a different zone (we landed to Z zone in FRA airport and my boarding was at B gate). Knowing that FRA is one of the biggest airports in the world I though it may be reasonable to go to the service desk with my husband and ask for a change of the ticket as ""running"" through the airport was not an exactly appealing option for a person with a knee injury. However, when we came to the service desk, there was a man guiding the queue to service desk windows and he also told me that I should run to catch my flight. It was 9:35 AM (as mentioned before, my boarding started at 9:15 AM). So if two people told me I should run I decided to leave my husband who was traveling to Prague and try to catch my flight. The trouble was that few steps later there was a different zone of the airport, then I had to go through train and security check, being out of breath when I finally came to the gate it was 9:50 AM and my flight had already left. The lady at the desk said that she is not willing to help me and I should go back to the service desk and change my ticket. In the lounge, they changed my ticket to 12:40 pm. Same time was the flight time for my husband, but as he was flying to Prague, and me to Moscow, we had to stay in different airport zones and were not able to come to each other. When I was boarding the plane, there was no walkway, but a bus, and they were saying that business goes after families with children to the bus. And the employee on the desk was extremely rude, screaming at business passengers they should wait till all children go the bus first. On the plane, the seats were not even with adjustable head. We had to wait for 45 minutes (plus to 4h flight) for some luggage to be loaded-unloaded and for some passenger to come to the plane. During this extra time of waiting in the aircraft there were no drinks offered. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2017-01-05;" |  Newark to Dusseldorf. Only through the grace of about a billion points was I able to snag a Newark to Dusseldorf reward flight to experience Lufthansa’s renowned First Class on my way to a final destination of Lisbon. I felt somewhat unworthy as I settled myself into my 2A open suite, however, I worked hard to maintain the requisite “I belong here” demeanor, unlike the fellow in front of me who danced in the aisle, champagne flute in hand, celebrating after his boss switched seats with him (boss relocating to Business). The A340-600 First Class cabin was full. I spent the first fifteen minutes sipping champagne, enjoying macadamia nuts, and playing with what seemed like several hundred seating variations from which to choose. Service, food and beverage was for the most part stellar although once it was ‘lights out’, our two attendants did somewhat of a disappearing act, although I’m sure they would have been prompt if I had rang for service. The dinner service was outstanding, caviar first course, followed by a trio of appetizers, lobster main, chocolate dessert, complimented with some excellent tasting wines, and all served course by course on a well-sized and nicely laid out dining table. An after-dinner aperitif coupled with a cappuccino (and a few more sweets thrown in for good measure) concluded a wonderful dining experience. Seats were promptly converted into comfortable looking beds with myself as the only hold-out. With privacy dividers raised, the group settled into a state of individual slumber. I chose to catch up on a few recent-run films through the night. A perfect photo-op of a sunrise appeared much too early, as did the perfectly prepared breakfast offering of smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, freshly squeezed orange juice and coffee.  Finishing my breakfast, I changed back into my streets in the very spacious and clean washroom. There was a noticeable lack of interaction with the flight crew. Except for the obligatory “Willkommen to, Danke für” announcements from the flight deck, nothing else was offered. Perhaps the pilots were feeling miffed with their airline, and working to rule, choosing not to associate with even the first class passengers as has apparently happened in the past. The Lufthansa First Class experience is truly special, and not only the in-flight portion, but the other touches such as personal escort from check-in, past security, and into the lounge, as well as the lounges themselves, the service and amenities offered on either continent. As I left the sanctity of the First Class section, a sense of claustrophobia overwhelmed me and I realized I was turning my nose up at Lufthansa Business Class! And, as I sat in TAP Business on my flight segment to Lisbon, with my all-on-one lunch tray crowding my thirty four inches of pitch, I reflected on how fortunate I was to have experienced the Lufthansa First Class product.

Without any compromise, you get the premium features shown in the advertising at a constant level. Queueless Check-In, priority lane at security, great lounge experience, priority boarding, meal-service and a great crew made it an easy way to travel. They no longer distribute pre-departure printed magazines and papers. But there is a download option with a pretty good selection.

lufthansa;2017-01-04;" |  Toronto to Pune via Frankfurt. We arrived late on the Air Canada flight from YYZ to FRA and missed our connecting Lufthansa flight to PNQ. There was no special arrangement to hurry the transit passengers to their flight. We had to wait for 3 busses to be filled as we were parked on the tarmac, prior to moving to the gate. Upon reaching the gate, we checked with the ground staff available and they told us to rush to the specified gate for our flight. We had to walk there, which we did, along with other passengers. By the time we reached the gate after going through Security, it was 5 minutes to the departure time - we were told that the flight had departed and we had to walk back to the customer service counter from where we had come for additional assistance. They advised us that they had not been intimated that we were on our way to catch the flight (along with 2 other passengers), even though we had our boarding cards. The Lufthansa ground staff insisted that it was the fault of Air Canada as the flight was operated by them.  They said the earliest connecting flight was at 7:00 am the next morning via Delhi. I had to remind them that there was an earlier one LH0760, which they agreed to put us on. They got us the tickets and told us to rush to the terminal to catch the flight before it left. We asked for a cart and were told none was available (we happened to get on the cart which the other 2 passengers who had also missed the flight were given by another ground staff). We had to go through Security again and had issues with the alcohol we had purchased in Toronto.  We requested an upgrade due to our exhaustion and inconvenience, which was refused. We got a call from a customer service representative who told us to contact Air Canada for our issues at they had operated the flight from YYZ to FRA. A terrible experience with Lufthansa which has excellent on board service, but very bad ground customer service.";NEGATIVE

We left pretty close to on time and they made up time on the way over. As soon as we boarded, I changed into the pyjamas and settled in for the overnight flight. Champagne and macadamias arrived quickly and on the seat was the Rimowa amenity kit. Meal service was delicious from the amuse bouche, caviar, black pepper pasta and I think it was chocolate bread pudding, though I was so full I couldn't. The wonderful champagne, I had the old world red and a lovely port. The crew on board couldn't do enough for us yet it still felt really private with a full cabin. After dinner, they made up the bed with a comfy top and bottom duvet and I got almost 5 hours of sleep. Breakfast was fresh and wonderful, I ate light as I had a 6 hour connection in Frankfurt before flying to Milan. My favourite part of flying first on Lufthansa is the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. This is a separate building with no gates attached. You walk out the main terminal doors and turn left and it's a five minute walk. Take the elevator up and they personally take care of you from then on. You can do this not only as a departing but as an arriving first class passenger too. The whole place is bar, they have a smoking room with, and I don't smoke them but my friends would love the cigars. Shower/bathrooms, private snooze rooms and comfy wing chairs and ottomans to sit and read a book. One of the three bathrooms has not only a shower but a full on soaker tub too. I booked it and read my book until my time came. Lufthansa understands that some of us still love to fly and it's about the experience and the swag. Sitting on the bath tub was another collectible Lufthansa First Class Terminal rubber ducky to add the collection. I had a delicious breakfast in the a la carte restaurant, the mimosas and long espressos were great too. It was Christmas after all and vacation. When time came to board they escorted me downstairs to a waiting limo (they have a fleet of Mercedes, Audi, BMW and Porsche vehicles from sedans to SUV's). They drive you across the tarmac to your next flight. I find it hard to fault Lufthansa these days, I like the whole experience in the air and on the ground. There are rumours that LH will discontinue first from North America, I hope not. I could get where I'm going in a shorter route but I consistently fly the long way round to Europe to experience this kind of service. Kudos to Lufthansa for a wonderful job with people who really care that the customer is happy.";POSITIVE

We checked in through priority channel which was no problem. Quick check-in procedure at the desk. I had some issues checking in online on the Lufthansa website, which I found very annoying. An online-form where I had to fill in my visa details for China got stalled. But things where quickly sorted out by the check-in attendant. Priority boarding with my colleague was not issue, as we travelled as one ground. Nice aircraft, with nice leather seats. Yet, these seats where a firm and offered little side support. As a result you shift sideways in your seat when the pilot takes quick short turns while taxiing. Good knee and leg space. On the flight a very tasty cake was served by friendly flights attendants. Overall it was a good first-time impression for me with Lufthansa.";POSITIVE

Flight departed not on time owing to the weather conditions at Dulles, but Lufthansa and German Air Traffic Control managed our flight to land on time. Seat comfort was nice with plenty of space left for my knees. Nonetheless, my seat was broken and therefore it reclined all the time which was awkward for the person sitting right behind me. Flight crew was outstanding. They did their job always with an extra smile and I told one flight attendant about my damaged seat and he dealt with the situation and offered me a new seat, which was fantastic. Food was okay, which was also down to me as I am not fond of Camembert cheese. Drinks were available all the time in the galleys and also offered by the crew throughout the flight. Inflight entertainment offered plenty of films in several languages which was a nice touch as well. The only thing bad about this flight was a rude female passenger next to me complaining about me going to the loo twice at this 8 hour lasting flight, but that is not Lufthansa's fault at all! I highly recommend flying with Lufthansa owing to its high standards in terms of security, service and reliability on the whole.";POSITIVE

The seat made all the difference although on this A330 the First Class cabin together with the restroom are not nearly as deluxe as those on the A380. The flight departed on time and onboard service was solid and reliable. For the FRA-BOM segment we were on the upper deck Business Class section of a new B747-8. Lufthansa has dropped the ball in the manner it has configured its new Business Class seats. They are narrow and angled towards your co-passenger in the row - a disaster that could have been avoided if Lufthansa hadn't gone cheap. By way of comparison, ANA's Business Class seat is the gold standard. Despite this disappointment, Lufthansa's reliability, predictability and vast flight network are its strengths.";POSITIVE

Lufthansa sent a text message our flights were cancelled and advised to look for alternative flights. The link provided in the text message didn't work (server error), neighter did their phone contact - all lines busy, please call later (repeated several times). We lost a few hours trying different contacts via mail, phone - nothing worked. Eventually we decided to take a trip to the airport and talk to their staff there. They re-booked our flights, but more than half a day was lost. That wasn't the end of the problems. When we arrived to Arlanda our checked-in suitcase didn't. As the baggage handling staff explain, it was because of our flight was rescheduled. I could understand that unsatisfied employees go on strike, but I'm also convinced there should be a functioning emergency plan for that kind of situation. It wasn't the first time I had problems with Lufthansa. They managed to screw up my flight schedule to South America (both ways!), they lost my skis, and now didn't render any support, losing our bag at the end.";NEGATIVE

I did not expect this to be possible, as I was calling them some 6 hours before the flight (from LHR) and the ticket costing around 5x as much as my economy light ticket on the LH flight.

Going back was somewhat different, as staff seemed tired, and the fact that Economy class stewards were in charge of Business class when the business class FA were having a break. Pushing the Cabin Attendant button did not make anyone come. Two very different experiences. No IFE was provided on the four hour flights between Funchal and Frankfurt, which is not good enough. However, there was an entertainment App available, but you need to download it before taking off. It's not available for Windows Phone, and when you get informed about the App, it's too late to install it, as flight mode is required, which to me makes no sense. Altogether Lufthansa still sticks to the Business Class concept, although there is room for improvement. Despite some minor twitches, we were very satisfied about the service.";POSITIVE

My flight to Frankfurt was just a few hours away when I got a text that the other leg of my journey from Frankfurt to Boston had been cancelled. I could not afford to be stranded in Frankfurt and nearing panic and desperate, I managed to book another flight through British Airways which would land me in Boston just a few hours later than the cancelled Lufthansa flight. So seventeen hundred dollars and a lot of heartache later, I finally landed in Boston. The following day, I decided to reach out to Lufthansa customer service to inquire about my refund for my cancelled flight. A curt lady told me that the refund was in process and would take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to go through, but she would not divulge the amount to me. I went ahead and told her that I had spent $1700 to rebook my flight just so I could be back in time for my wife's surgery at which point I was told, and I quote - ""that was your decision and your problem. We are not liable for it"". So, was it my fault that Lufthansa decided to cancel my flight because of the pilot strike which is their own internal problem? And they have had this issue for years. their cabin crew and pilots have gone on impromptu strikes for the past couple of years now and the ones to suffer are the gullible passengers. Lufthansa reported recorded profits this year and it is not hard to imagine where most of that money came from: their gullible customers who they so merrily swindle at every opportunity. The only reason that I have posted this review is that I do not want another person to go through what me (and probably thousands of others) have suffered at the hands of this inconsiderate and greedy airline. I would dearly suggest to you that if you are booking your flight at least a month in advance, you are better off going with a more stable airline, as Lufthansa is very unpredictable and can cancel flights and leave passengers stranded with no recourse whatsoever.

I travelled economy class, and the legroom, the seat recline, food and the amenities in general were just superb. They offered us water and snacks, plus the meals. The best economy class I've used, better than Air France in long-haul flights. The A380 is a great plane as well.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-11-07;" |  The flights from Tampa to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt were uneventful with the possible exception of having to hike half way around the airport at Frankfurt. The return flight was quite different, it started with Lufthansa canceling our flights on one date and telling us we would have to leave a day earlier or a day later the problem was I would either have to pay for an additional day which was not available - so I opted to leave a day early which meant I was out a days room rent, which is not cheap. We were also bought our tickets 6 months in advance and paid extra for seats in the front of the plane. On the flights they put us on we were in the back of the plane, telling us it didn't matter that we paid for advanced seating, that only meant you were paying for window or aisle - really - we paid $180.00 extra for a window or aisle seat. In conclusion I understand flight changes happen, but I do not understand the rudeness of the employees in Frankfurt when I went to customer service to talk about a refund on our return flight seating, which was definitely not what we paid for.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-11-06;" |  London Heathrow to Panama City return, via Frankfurt. I've been flying with Lufthansa for a long time but the flight to Panama was the first long-haul one that I've had using this airline. Lufthansa didn't let down and their service was really great. Flight from LHR to FRA departed on time. It was a short flight and we received snacks. Cabin was clean, crew very polite and professional. Arrival in FRA was on schedule. Transfer in FRA took more than 2 hours so there was plenty of time of getting to the required gate. Boarding started on time. The only little con, however, was that we were taken to the plane by bus, despite the fact that it was an A340-300. Cabin crew welcomed us with smiles. The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible. There were 2 hot meals, snacks and plenty of drinks. What I can recommend Lufthansa, though, is to enlarge an IFE choice, especially the movie collection. For the rest the service was great and we've arrived in Panama on time. I will definitely be using Lufthansa services in the future and can recommend it to everyone.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-11-02;Flew Lufthansa from Lima to Frankfurt. Gate was a bit too small for the pax load and boarding was delayed by 20 mins. I reserved a seat with extra space and it was great value for money. Cabin was clean and FAs well presented. Take off was delayed for almost an hour due ATC. It's overnight flight so dinner was served promptly after take off and lights switched off soon after tables were cleared. I slept for about 7h and extra leg room helped the experience quite a lot. Manged to watch a movie at the beginning and another at the end of the flight. I like Lufthansa's IFE as it is not focused only on commercial entertainment with music section being my favorite. Light breakfast was served 2h before landing. We landed with 30min delay but it did not affect my connecting flight with another company. Another quality experience with Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-31;" |  This was my first flight on Lufthansa flying from Osaka to London Heathrow via Frankfurt. I booked Premium Economy as I usually do on other airlines where available. Overall, I thought that whilst the flight was comfortable and reasonable value, the Lufthansa Premium Economy was not as good as other airlines that I have used. There was just a few rows within the Economy class and the only thing to differentiate Premium Economy from Economy was the seats and legroom (which were fine I might add). The food was the same as Economy (very average both ways even by Economy standards although printed on a different Premium Economy menu), shared the same stewards on board and at check-in and boarding there was no separate boarding queue for Premium Economy. Whilst these are not big issues at all I do feel that for paying twice the airfare they might have offered slightly more to differentiate it from Economy.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-30;" | Budapest to Manchester via Munich with Lufthansa. Beware with certain types of economy ticket, you will be asked to pay to check in luggage. I flew from Manchester to Budapest with Brussels Airlines and a piece of checked-in luggage was included in the price. However, on the way back, the same did not apply with Lufthansa. As I did not book the flight for myself, I was unaware of this. If you're flying a full-service airline, such as Lufthansa, you can at least expect not to have to pay for one piece of checked-in luggage. Otherwise, what's the point of paying so much more for a ticket when you can fly with Ryanair or easyjet?. It seems this policy has been introduced this year as I have flown many times with Lufthansa and never had this experience before.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-28;" | Frankfurt to New York JFK with Lufthansa. Pleasant flight on the whole. Flight departed and landed on time. We had priority boarding, which was nice. Seat was nice and comfy. IFE provided plenty of films, although the screen was difficult to deal with. Food was okay (just owing to the fact that I dislike Camembert cheese). Crew was polite and good in doing their service, but not excellent as our last crew on the 747 has been. Aeroplane was clean on the whole. It was an amazing experience to fly on the A380.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-27;"Got an unbelievable deal from YVR-YYZ-MAD early October, so I wasn't expecting much in the way of comfort or service. Going out was Air Canada (average, as usual). coming back from Madrid to Vancouver via Munich was Lufthansa. Lufthansa was just fine: the flight from Madrid to Munich unmemorable. but the flight from Munich to Vancouver was very good. Initially I had a whole row of four to myself, but before takeoff a man moved, and sat in the other second seat in, so I ended up with just one empty seat beside me, which was still nice. Service was prompt, professional and friendly. I always order a special meal on long flights, in order to get served first. Not because I'm greedy, but that way you are finished first and can use the still clean bathrooms and get settled to sleep before the lineups for the bathrooms start. Special meals are always a mystery, but this time I had ordered Asian Vegetarian, and it was really tasty. and I was very pleased. A delicious veg curry, plenty of fruit, some really good bread and cheese. Plenty juice and water offered throughout the flight, plus a weird tasting cookie at one point. Very comfy seat, 45G - with enough leg room for me. The film selection on the IFE was a bit dated. and no new films that appealed to me. A good flight overall, considering how little I paid for the ticket!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-25;Prague to Hamburg via Frankfurt. Very pleasant experience. The flights were on time and the crews were very pleasant including making funny but still appropriate announcements. A snack and free beverages were served which is adequate for those short flights. Lufthansa serves Warsteiner which is probably one of the best beers in Germany. In addition I got a really good deal for the ticket. Can't complain about the legroom. however the flight attendants. especially on the PRG-FRA leg have to be more willing to speak English as almost nobody onboard was German.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-25;Hamburg to Prague via Frankfurt. Got a really good deal on Lufthansa. The flights were comfortable with decent leg room and an adequate on-board service. Both flights were delayed and the crews/gate personnel were making excuses for the delay. Apparently the plane arrived late from FRA. It's been standing at the gate for at least 30 minutes. Otherwise friendly flight attendants and I still made my connection. Their inflight magazine featured some nice articles but could do with less advertisements.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-21;" |  Montreal to Sarajevo via Munich. Lufthansa impresses me and makes me feel welcomed, ranging from its varied In-flight Entertainment system to its superb Customer Service both on the ground and in the air. I have flown numerous times on Lufthansa long-hauls and short-hauls and on every flight I've been on the cabin crew service ranged from good to exceptional. Their ground staff ranged from grumpy and cold (we're all humans after all) to exceptional, with some who had even gone way out of the way to ensure that I was looked after (particularly in Munich). In-flight entertainment system is multi-lingual, more than you'd expect. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-19; |  Route was Houston to Frankfurt return on October 13th and 17th. Service was superb and the A380 First class on Lufthansa is always a delight for First Class Travel. Amenities ware great as well as the very attentive staff. Food was excellent and the selection was great. In flight entertainment selection good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-15;" | Flew from Dresden to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt with Lufthansa in economy. The flight was pleasant, service and food quality very good. actually, the food was surprisingly good for economy class. Inflight entertainment on the leg from FRA to TLV (and back) via customer-owned devices was good and worked well (uses onboard Wifi), but the actual selection of films was a bit mediocre. Music and newspapers were plenty, though. We had the seats in front of the emergency exit rows on the A321. The seats were good for economy class seats, although they did not recline (minor issue with economy seats in my opinion, since they do not recline far anyway) and were a bit less wide compared to the other seats. However, these are one of the few seats in a pair arrangement on the singe-aisle A321. Seat pitch was sufficient, and I assume the extra-thin new economy seats of Lufthansa give about one inch of additional legroom. Cabin a bit too noisy for my taste. Service very good, food exceptionally good for economy class on both flights.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-13;"Frankfurt to Buenos Aires. I booked flight in economy class and then used miles to upgrade it to Premium Economy as my booking class did not allow me upgrade to business. Flight was overbooked and gate agents asked for volunteers to fly tomorrow for money compensation. When trying to pass ticket scanner my ticket was rejected and I had to report to gate agent who surprised me with a new seat in business class. I think I was upgraded due my loyalty i.e by using miles for upgrade. FRA to EZE is the longest LH flight (almost 14 hours) and it was great to be in good seat, served nice food and drinks by wonderful attentive FA who made me feel like a guest, not just a passenger. It was one of those flights when you would not mind to last a little bit longer.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-09;" |  Once more the Lufthansa bus from Strasbourg to Frankfurt was late. This time it was road works, but LH had done nothing to avoid, although they most certainly knew since they do 6 trips per day. I arrived at FRA airport 10 min before boarding, running all the way across the airport (more than 1.5 km), arriving at the gate 15 min before scheduled departure, to find that the plane that would take us had just arrived. 10 min *after* scheduled departure, LH announced a delay of 30 min. In the end we left 1 hour after schedule. The LH app never reported any delay at all. This scenario I have experienced about 3 times in the last 4 months. I have been flying LH regularly for 2.5 years (I don't have much choice unfortunately) and I don't remember the last time that the plane left on schedule. LH is really bad in timeliness. For the inflight experience, the seats are rather uncomfortable in the economy class and the food is marginally edible. Beverage selection is good though. This time the crew was very friendly, presentable and helpful, which is not always the case.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-10-02;" |  I got a ticket from Strasbourg to Athens via Frankfurt return. This includes a Lufthansa Express bus on the SXB-FRA-SXB segments. I missed the SXB-FRA segment, and got to FRA (200 Km) with my car, 2 hours before the flight and with a valid boarding pass. However, while trying to board the plane, I was denied entry and I was informed that all the rest of my segments were canceled, including return from ATH. They argued that I missed the 1st segment (the bus) and when I complained that this is only a bus, they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane (keep this in mind).  They wanted me to buy a new ticket, because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when I would fly! After much grief, they allowed to board. fortunately there was 1 seat, but warned me to call LH as soon as I got to ATH. So I did and asking them to show me where are these terms stated (that is, if I miss the 1st segment and in particular the bus, all are canceled), they couldn't. After much debate, they  issued a new ticket for me for the return, for small admin fee. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-30;"I arrived 3 hours before departure of my flight from Paris CDG - Frankfurt - LH1047. My connection time in FRA was tight (75 min, T.A to T.C, with immigration + security). However one flight (90 minutes before, LH1041) had available seats. Suddenly CDG T1 went on red alert due to 2 suspect abandoned luggages and circulation was limited. I asked to take the previous flight to FRA remaining unchanged my FRA-GIG intercontinental flight. I was directed to ticket counter where there was no LH employee. A call centre was called, and they requested payment of Euros 1050,00 for this 90 minutes anticipation on the first leg of my business class trip, despite terrorist alert. I refused. There are situation when common sense and passengers security must prevail over airline revenue on fines. Note that in FRA despite all advertisement made when I bought my ticket, aircraft was a very old B747 instead of B747-8. Otherwise, usual perfect service and comfort on board.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-30;" | It's a pity Lufthansa handed over almost all European routes to Eurowings (except for those out of Frankfurt and Munich), because it's a great airline also on short domestic hops. Good legroom in the very quiet A320neo. Efficient service since you get handed over a chocolate bar at the entrance, so the crew only has to serve drinks. They're happy to serve you more than one drink. Took of half an hour late, but landed only 10 mins behind schedule. Apologies from the cockpit. My favourite airline.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-27;" | Milan Linate to Mexico City return via Frankfurt and Munichh with Lufthansa. Short business trip to Mexico, I decided to use Premium Economy and was satisfied with this product. The comfort during such a long flight was improved with a much wider and softer seat with very good legroom. As usual with LH, staff was courteous and professional, not over friendly but surely polite. I have to mention the weird announcements in Spanish back from Mexico City as they were super bad and I believe they should hire some native speaking crew member becuase the whole plane was laughing at the very weird accent. Food was good on the outbound flight but mediocre on the way back. A few more complaints - boarding in FRA was pretty disorganized and slow becuase the automatic machines were out of order and no priority was given to PE passengers. On the final leg from MUC to Milan, they displayed 1h delay on the screens so I went for breakfast: when I was done I realized that they had moved it back to its original schedule so I rushed to the gate to find out they had just started to board. Then, they kept us waiting on the stairs in pure ""Ryanair style"" for almost 20 minutes before the bus arrived to take us to our plane which was parked far away so in the end we landed in Milano almost 1 hour late.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-26;" |  Bucharest to Madrid via Frankfurt,  and Valencia to Bucharest via Frankfurt. Four short flights, 2 hrs. approx. each. The most important thing was that all flights were on time and uneventful. The planes were clean and seemed to be in good technical situation. Enough legroom for a medium tall (1.75 m) passenger as I am. Cabin crew and ground staff were polite and efficient. The food was quite poor (better on FRA-MAD leg), sandwiches just edible. Fortunately they kept Warsteiner in their offer. No inflight entertainment and the announcements from cockpit difficult to understand. All in all, a good product, decent priced (223 EUR/pers for four flights). Due to Lufthansa's connections at their hubs in Frankfurt and Munich, this airline remains a solid option to travel from Bucharest to other destinations.";POSITIVE

This was my first experience with Lufthansa and I really enjoyed the experience. I could recline the seat nicely. I was well fed with a delicious 3-course dinner and breakfast meals during the flight. The selection of movies was great. Cabin staff were generous, polite and friendly. My overall experience in Lufthansa was excellent.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-20;" |  Brussels to Malta via Munich. Both flight from start to finish were excellent, the flight to Munich departed on time excellent cabin service good choice of refreshments offered. Although the aircraft was over 26 years old it certainly did not show its age. The second leg was on an A320 less than 3 months old. The same excellent level of service given. On time arrivals on both legs. An excellent level of service, would certainly use Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-13;"Flew from London to Seoul via Frankfurt and back. Both legs of the journey had short change over times and both times the flight was delayed, meaning a stressful sprint across one side of the terminal to another. Onboard, there were plenty of drinks being offered and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were the hard, flat seats and the boring entertainment options (only 3 Korean movies were offered even though 95% of the passengers were Korean. I noticed others were bored too). I sat near the toilets and never saw a flight attendant cleaning the toilets, which were dirty towards the end. Overall, it is excellent value for money, cheaper than other competitors served by excellent cabin crew.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-10;" |  The flight from Frankfurt to Rome FCO was an all-round solid experience. We flew aboard a very new (2015) A320-200 with sharklets. Unfortunately the weather was not that great so we experienced some turbulence. LH European business class seats are the same as those in economy but with a free middle seat. I am not too tall so I don't mind them, as they are quite comfortable and have a very supporting firm backrest. I always try to sit in the first row so legroom was no problem. The foldout table mounted to the bulkhead is a nice touch and very spacious. The food was good (a salade nicoise and a dessert), adequate for the time of the day (5pm) but a little more could be expected, as everything looks a little bland. The purser, however, was very attentive and friendly. I really like the Lufthansa  colour scheme as it gives the whole plane a classy look. The complete lack of IFE puzzles me however and I really miss the air show that allows me to follow the route. All in all a solid product and good value for money if you also factor in the possibility to access the FRA business class lounge.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-09-07;" |  Dublin business class lounge is back in the dark ages. Almost as bad as Rome, and that's saying something. Fridge not working so no cold drinks. Food was very light so saved myself for the flight, bad mistake. They have a press button survey machine at the entrance to the lounge - they know it's bad. Hit the unhappy face. The flight food was delivered before any drinks. Had to wait 10 minutes for the non dedicated business class staff (they did economy class as well) to get around to serving me a glass of water, so I could eat the lousy prawn and inedidable chunk of tuna. Second glass if wine? No, serving economy class passengers. Luckily the flight was just under 2 hours. I'm now in the business class lounge at Frankfurt, Z concourse. No staff to serve a drink, but two staff sitting behind a desk doing nothing? The Virgin lounge at Perth airport, in Australia, is much better. Come on this is Frankfurt, Germany, Lufthansa's hub airport, and Perth airport is better? Best part about the lounge? It's very quiet. Maybe I should have coughed for the Lufthansa Senator lounge.";NEGATIVE

The food is tasty, they don't nickel and dime you for an adult beverage, and instead of giving you a sour puss liked United, they always smile warmly. Also, unlike United, after they serve you a drink and your meal they don't disappear in the galley behinda curtain to consult their bid sheets. They come around every 1/2 hour or so with a tray of orange juice and water and don't scowl when you go to the galley for another drink. They do everything right.";POSITIVE

Very small plane, and as a 6 foot tall man, I barely fit in the cabin. The crew was very nice, and spoke fluent English with Polish greetings at the beginning and end of the flight. Flight from Munich to Newark was also phenomenal. Economy class is just like any other, nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, and the service was superb. The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft with a nice feature: the bathrooms are downstairs. We landed 45 minutes earlier, and the transfer was easy. I have been flying with Lufthansa for 4 years now, and it is always easier to fly with them through Frankfurt or Munich rather than drive to JFK just to fly with LOT. Recommend for anyone looking for a safe and reliable trip.";POSITIVE

Ground crew and boarding efficiency very poor, out of 4 segments flow in only one case did they have priority boarding announced for business and then didn't check status as everyone came up together. On other three legs they were two busy or behind schedule so did a single call with all passengers waiting together. On board food of a very poor quality. Two of the four meals were left, and one order of chicken turned out to be salmon, when pointed out they apologised but said all the chicken had gone so the only option was the economy meal or veggie. On one leg curtain left open and had constant stream of passengers disturbing my effort to sleep and even taking seats in business whilst waiting to use toilet. Staff did not seem concerned. No in flight entertainment unless you have already downloaded their app to a suitable device. No notification on this so nothing on the outbound legs. Tried to load onto my Kindle for return but not available on this device, loaded onto my Android mobile but kept hanging when in use so gave up. Overall would not rate the offer on these short flights as business class, would be more accurate to term premium economy.";NEGATIVE

All flights were on time, cabin was clean and well maintained, even in the old B737. Cabin crew was nice and attentive. Best was the catering, LH offered a salmon sandwich and 2 drink rounds on this short flight including free alcoholic beverages. Only negative aspect was the check in at Frankfurt airport. Ground staff forced me to use automated bag drop although I let them know that I wanted to use bag drop with ""real"" staff. On my return flight bag drop was handled by a friendly employee.";POSITIVE

Unfriendly, taking us away a slightly (we speak about 1cm) too big hand luggage for making extra money while sending it empty to Beijing as checked bag. On the short hop to Frankfurt they served a Beer. The premium Economy Class Cabin on the A380 is on the lower deck in front of the plane. You have your separate cabin, looks like a Business Class in the old days. To start they brought fresh juice, followed after take of with the Menu Card and nuts and sparkling wine. 2 menus to choose from and very well presented on China with metal cutlery and a real glas for wine. 2 different white and red wine to choose. Meal from Frankfurt was extremely good. Crew was professional and attentively. IFE is good with a selection of German movies, Leg room is sufficient, only a little bit difficult to move from middle or window seat to the aisle. Seat is comfortable. I recommend Lufthansa Premium Economy Class.";POSITIVE

Nevertheless, they should do something about their partner airlines whose professionalism is not as high. On the San Francisco Airport, the staff of their partner airline didn't want to let our 12 year old son into the Senator Lounge because a Gold membership card allows only one guest. They asked us to pay $59 for him to enter for only 1 hour (the time we had before our flight to Frankfurt) which we okayed. As if $59 was not enough they said that our MasterCard didn't have any money on it (not true) and on top of it all didn't want to accept cash. So they turned us away. This has never happened to us before. We were allowed to go into every single lounge around the world without paying an extra fee for our son. Bad image for Star Alliance indeed.";POSITIVE

The flight from Frankfurt to Malta boarded on time. The plane was clean and service friendly and efficient. A decent continental breakfast (see photo) was served, along with good coffee and sparkling wine. A choice of magazines was also available on board.

The meals weren't bad, and everything was good until we came to Toronto. We had to get our bags (2 big bags) and take them with us through customs but when we went to get our bags they were not there, this also happened when we were flying to Zagreb the first time. I was not impressed, we went to go ask the lady at the baggage claim who worked for the airline, but she was very rude. After we filled out the form to claim our bags, we were told they might meet you in Saskatoon, which they didn't. Once we got to Sasktoon we went to the bag claim where they couldn't even trace our bags, and they told us once they know they will contact us and send them to us. We called the next day to see if they found them and they did not, they then told us to call back tomorrow because they still can't trace them. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-08-19;" |  San Francisco to Frankfurt in First Class. Lufthansa uses the United Global First Lounge at SFO, a pleasant, but unremarkable, space. Lufthansa's A380 First Class cabin has an 8-seat arrangement. I was in 1A, right in the front and on the second deck of the aircraft. Upon entry into the cabin each First Class passenger is given a personal locker to store carry-on luggage. The seat was extremely comfortable, with a modicum of privacy provided by an adjustable screen separator. Two spacious washrooms serviced the First Class cabin. Where Lufthansa's First Class product excelled was in its exceptional onboard service. The lady flight attendant assigned to me was highly professional and personable, anticipating my needs as the flight progressed. Turndown service with mattress and blanket was provided when I wanted to sleep. Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages there's nothing to add to on that front. As for the food, this is as good as it gets on a flight, but I like to eat light. After landing, I went to the excellent Lufthansa First Class Lounge at FRA, an oasis of calm, and after a relaxing couple of hours was driven in a limousine via the tarmac directly to my outbound aircraft.";POSITIVE

The seats were not that comfortable, there is no flight entertainment at all but overall not that bad. Second leg (FRA-MEX) flight was really great. The food was great and the staff was friendly.

Ground staff was very helpful replying to all my questions and forwarding my bags to my final destination and were very polite and efficient. After which Lufthansa was kind enough to provide me a nice selection of electronic reading material for my trip, which was a nice touch. Boarding was fast and efficient and the plane departed on time. It was a very clean and new looking plane, with comfortable seats and we were lucky to get the new inflight entertainment system where with your mobile phone you could download the Lufthansa app and connect to the airplane's inflight wi-fi system to stream music, videos or just see the flight progress. Very nice touch for a short/medium flight, which generally don't provide any kind of entertainment whatsoever. Cabin crew was nice and polite as always and served us a simple, yet very tasty breakfast, with a very nice sandwich made of rye bread. The flight was pleasant, quiet and with no turbulence. Arriving at Frankfurt the staff was more than helpful in directing us to the boarding gates to our connection flight - transfer process was fast, simple and quiet.";POSITIVE

Food was delicious for economy class, and service was relatively quick. Inflight entertainment was good, not the best but good enough for the length of the flight. The cabin staff service was good too. The flight crew gave out playing cards, and even toys to small children. They also were efficient and helpful. Legroom was not cramped but it wasn't much either.  Overall, I would fly with Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-08-07;" | Amman to Toronto via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. My flight from Amman to Frankfurt was delayed 3 hours, and my transit time was 3 hours 45 minutes. Prior to departure, I contacted Lufthansa asking if I would be able to make my connecting flight and they informed me that I would not be able to and advised me to change my booking. They changed the booking for me to 5pm, which meant that I now had an 8 hour transit in Frankfurt. Upon arrival at Frankfurt, they informed passengers that there would be a special shuttle to take them to the aircraft that was in my original booking. They were unable to let me back onto the flight and refused to put me onto the 2 pm flight although it was their advice to change the booking. I was on the phone, on hold, for over 40 minutes and I was still not provided with any solutions. I have been on flights before with delays and the customer service has been far better. Lufthansa does not take care of their passengers who are put into these situations.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-08-04;"Route to Nice from Prague via Munich just one day after the attacks, everything went smooth, no cancelation or delay, just a bit of chaos noticed at the airport of Nice because someone left an unattanded bag in front of the terminal 1. The route from PRG to MUC operated by Air Dolomiti with a brand-new Embraer 195 as a part of the LH group, mostly Italian cabin crew on board, they were friendly and nice to passangers but poor and obscure English and German spoken. A small cake was offered before boarding at the airplane´s door, complimentary soft drinks during this short flight as well. The airport in Munich very modern, de-boarding in the brand-new satelitte Star Alliance terminal (gates K and L) via the tunnel, pleased to visit and see it. The connecting flight to Nice operated by the Lufthansa A319, boarding via the tunnel again. Complimentary drinks and a smaller tasty cheese sandwich offered, nice cabin crew, mostly older and experienced German ladies. The approach and arrival into Nice airport located on the contiguous island above the Mediterranean sea along the Cote d´Azur´s coastline is one of the nicest in Europe that I´ve ever seen, very similar to e.g. San Francisco in the US. Pleased again to fly Lufthansa as usual.";POSITIVE

Even on this short flight Lufthansa served a drink, free of charge. The long haul from DUS to JFK, the waiting area in DUS was rather small even for a medium sized airplane like the A340-400. The boarding was very professional and smooth. My boys wanted to have aisle seats, thats what we got. Lufthansa has a very good special meal programe free of charge, which if you order ahead, gives you the opportunity to chose between 20 diffrent mealtypes. I chose indian vegetarian. First off all you get your food before everybody else does, it is still hot. And this was the best food I had on a economy class flight. IFE was nothing great but kept the boys entertained - which was great. The FAs were nice and helpful.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-07-31;" |  Lufthansa from Vancouver to Geneva via Munich on 15 June 2016 in economy class. Because the first 20-minute YYJ-YVR connector flight was by Air Canada, on-line check-in had to be on AC website rather than LH website, even though all three flights had LH flight numbers and it was an LH ticket purchased on the LH website. The two airlines had recorded different booking codes for the trip, so only by telephoning LH was it possible to obtain the equivalent AC booking code in order to proceed with on-line check-in. YVR-MUC leg (10h30) aboard an A330-300. Main meal was the chicken or stuffed pasta, bland but adequately filling. while second meal was negligible, a couple of snacks as one might purchase from a vending machine. FAs very helpful throughout, making regular runs to offer water or juice, with full beverage service available from the galley. AVOD offered a vast array of films, music, and television programs. The A330 had a 5cm gap the armrest and the fuselage on each side of the plane. The armrest should, instead, be right up against the fuselage to make use of that wasted 10 cm. As well, the A330 had IFE system boxes under the seats. Footroom was severely reduced and it was impossible for any standard carry-on bag to be accommodated except in the overhead bins. (Have previously travelled on LH A330-300 with much better seat design accommodating full-sized carry-on bags beneath the seat, although still leaving the wasted 5 cm gap between the armrest and fuselage on each side.) MUC-GVA leg (1h10) aboard an LX A319, with seating far more comfortable than the A330. A sandwich and drink were served. Good variety of newspapers offered when boarding at YVR. Excellent variety available when changing planes in MUC terminal.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2016-07-20;" |  Flight from Hong Kong to Luxembourg via Frankfurt. First leg with Airbus A380-800, upper deck business cabin. I've had the 'pleasure' of flying Lufthansa Airbus A380-800 in economy cabin and it was a horrible experience, unfortunately flying with business is a similar experience. One of the worst business class cabins I've flown - seats are narrow and tight, if you do not get a window seat there's no storage space at all for anything (window seats come with additional storage space along the fuselage) so every time you have to get up and reach the overhead bin. Film selection is so-so, the only positive side are the noise cancelling headphones. Food was average at best, service was mixed - the flight attendant taking care of my section was great, smiling, friendly and speaking English. I've noticed that on numerous Lufthansa flights that cabin crew first of all has this cold business attitude and tends to speak German, even if you speak to them in English. The second leg was ok, with a typical short haul flight seat, space and service - nothing special worth mentioning. At that point I would also suggest to avoid travelling through Frankfurt as this airport is a disgrace with rude and puzzled personnel and long waiting lines. The only bright point is the Lufthansa Welcome Lounge with extremely nice and helpful staff. Overall I would not recommend, next time I will fly with Swiss which is way better.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-07-20;"Vancouver to Munich with Lufthansa. The flight experience was nicer than on the way to Vancouver as the flight wasn't fully booked and I had a window seat with the seat next to me free. Once again, nothing to complain about and lots to enjoy while onboard. However, the Air Canada Maple Leaf ""lounge"" at YVR was the worst experience - totally outdated, though due to be renovated this fall (that's what I've been told), but that doesn't help for the moment. No showers, 90's style fax machines and Internet terminals (I wonder who has ever touched them in the last 10 years or so), worn down furniture, lousy food and lots of mediocre alcoholic beverages. Not the kind of place to relax and refresh yourself after a busy day before your evening inter-cont flight. This gave me a really bad start to my journey and the staff was absolutely unable to cope with anything but a ""say hello and goodbye service""";POSITIVE

The seats were comfortable enough (I'm 1.86m tall and not the thinnest guy), they are full flat and I slept pretty well. It also provided me with enough privacy. IFE was also good. The food - well, I'm not a professional restaurant critic as most of us - but it was to my mind fully satisfying with respect to taste and quality. The wines where delicious and the the service was outstanding - very attentive but never obtrusive. Nothing to complain about and a lot to enjoy while onboard.

Wine list - very exclusive. Compared to some other airlines that we have flown in First, they are far ahead. Sommelier does a great job. Food is very good. Caviar trolley as a start is a remarkable way to please us. The only pity is that they switched the brand of the vodka and Beluga is no longer aboard. Flight attendants also suggest that you follow the service flow. It seems that they make you eat to suit their timing on board. Overall, Lufthansa has been my preferred airline in First.";POSITIVE

I therefore cancelled (with fine) my TAP reservation (US$3500,00 return), and had a much better service, even on short Frankfurt - Marseille leg. Ground: Very quick check-in and boarding, however one of the poorest lounge (GIG) I ever seen. I have heard that a Star Alliance lounge is being prepared. Flight: Upper-deck, seat 84A, more external noise than backwards (86A for instance), however less galley noise. Staff extremely dedicated to a very personalized service. Unforgettable kindness.

The flight attendants could be friendlier instead of being just efficient.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2016-07-10;"Miami to Berlin via Frankfurt. I checked in 23 hours before the flight and was able to move my seat assignment to the upper deck, first row of economy in the back of the plane. This is an exit row so I had good leg room. I have a United Gold card so I was directed to the Avianca Lounge after going through security. The lounge was well-stocked but the chairs were not first class. The flight was full but boarding the 500 passengers was not a problem as they had two walkways to the plane set up, one for the lower and one for the upper deck. I had the beef dinner which was excellent and filling. The fasten seatbelt sign was turned off six minutes after take-off and did not come back on until 25 minutes to landing. This is a great airline for the business traveler who does not want to be woken up during a flight with the words, ""Seatbelts."" I dozed off and when I woke up, everyone in my row had their breakfast. I walked to the toilet and the flight attendant said, I will be right back with your breakfast. Breakfast consisted of eggs, potatoes, and fresh fruit. The entertainment system worked well. Flight attendants were friendly and professional. I used the lounge in Frankfurt before boarding my flight to Berlin. The lounge was excellent.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2016-07-06;" |  Vienna to Singapore via Frankfurt. The nice thing about Lufthansa is that they are running a tight airline operation that usually doesn’t leave anything to chance. The not so nice thing about Lufthansa is that being tight can quickly turn into being uptight with little wiggle room if a certain degree of flexibility is required. I was almost refused boarding because my return flight from Frankfurt to Singapore was booked for a date which happened to be beyond the extent of my 90 day visa-free stay period in the country. I understand that airlines have to adhere to the rules as stipulated by immigration laws, but ultimately the decision to allow me to board the flight rested with Lufthansa’s flight manager who proved to be stubborn and neither susceptible to reasoning nor my explanation that I was not intending to spend the 5 months in Singapore but would travel in the wider region. It took almost an hour of arguing back and forth with several Lufthansa representatives before I was finally issued a boarding pass. I had flown into Singapore with other airlines on similar arrangements before and never had this kind of problem. The flight itself was solid, with the cabin crew being friendly, professional, and attentive.";POSITIVE

You can be sure to get exactly this amount of extra comfort, you pay for with the Business Class-ticket. Priority lanes at security and boarding, meal-service (see picture), Business-Lounge and a helpful crew are making the flight nice and easy. The seat is an economy-seat, but with the middle-seat blocked, you have two armrests for your own and more distance to fellow-passengers.

I hadn't flown Lufthansa on an intercontinental flight for a while and I was extremely surprised to find out how much their standards had gone down since my last long haul flight with them. Flew from San Francisco to Istanbul via Frankfurt. Check in was very efficient and fast, lounge in SFO was United's first class lounge which was nice. Once on board, we were presented with the slippers, pajamas and amenity kits. 50 minutes after take off, I decided to ask for a glass of wine as nothing was offered. Food was really some of the worst I have had. From presentation to taste it was a fiasco. The crew was efficient but unfriendly. Seat comfort and bed was perfect. Once in Frankfurt, connecting first class passengers were not met like with other airlines and we had to struggle through that crazy airport taking sky trains and tunnels plus another security check which by the way doesn't exist on most other airports if you are coming from the USA before reaching the first class lounge. The lounge itself is perfect with all amenities. Connecting in Frankfurt is a nightmare and unfortunately Lufthansa is on the bottom of my list for intercontinental flights especially with the price they charge for first class.";NEGATIVE

A flight attendant giving the safety briefing was standing on the front of the aircraft whom could not be seen from Row 4 (behind the curtains). She did not like when we lifted the curtain to see the safety instruction.  A bit later on during the flight when they started to serve hot drinks, the flight attendant started to serve coffee. My wife asked for two milk/creamer with her coffee, she was given only one. She asked again for the second sachets as the flight attendant dismissing the request and started to walked away, she said her colleague would serve more milk (this was the first row on economy she served, so she did not run out of milk/creamers). She ignored my wife and walked away. A bit later during the flight we asked for some milk for our 2 year old son. The senior flight attendant said they don't carry milk on the aircraft. We flew with lufthansa 10 days earlier on the same type of aircraft and they had milk for a baby.  Seats were average, there was no inflight entertainment on this short flight. ";NEGATIVE

Last time I flew the gate was at the B concourse which is quite a trek before you have even started your day. Excellent flight. Boarding announcements at gate 18 LHR T2 were unintelligible so that worked well for me as I sauntered up to the gate before others realised that boarding was called. Quite simply the friendliest crew I have encountered in a long time. Just after take-off a breakfast was offered of cake, cheese or salami sandwich. I had eaten in the terminal so declined and chose to have a cup of coffee and then sleep. Cannot fault the crew – announcements clear and informative (flight deck and cabin). 10 out of 10.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-06-12;" | Frankfurt to Addis Ababa with Lufthansa. The connection in FRA is laborious and involves lots of walking. I took a leisurely stroll directly from my arriving flight to the gate (stopping for a little shopping for around 10 minutes) and altogether it took almost an hour to navigate through the airport, the mono-rail, the security checks, the other security checks and then to the gate. That said, when I arrived at the gate, boarding had just been called so the timing was, in fact perfect. I am impressed with the number of people on the ground to assist you with the transit. It seems there are no end of red-jacketed people to see that you go in the right direction. The crew were very welcoming and bright. Before take off a welcome drink of minty orange juice was offered in plastic wine-style glasses. After take off menu cards were distributed and pre-dinner drinks offered. They commenced with the meal service a little while later but had to abandon it due to turbulence. A helpful announcement was made, apologising for the delay. Two choices of main course were offered which were served on china and with metal cutlery. Red or white wine was offered from a full size bottle with water (sparkling or still). I have a little gripe with the way the service is ordered as I have noticed that on every flight a refill of wine is not offered until just before the coffee service. I would like to be offered a second glass of wine with my meal. After coffee (quite a long while after) after-dinner drinks (Cognac or Baileys). I asked for a refill of coffee at this point – it came about 10 mins later. A chocolate was also offered. Prior to landing in Jeddah (refuelling and crew change) a small half-sandwich was offered (no choice) and this was followed by a glass of orange juice served from a tray. Another gripe is that there is no tidy-up of the cabin during the re-fuelling stop. There were vast numbers of strewn blankets, discarded cups and every conceivable wrapper strewn all across the cabin and they remained there for the rest of the flight to Addis. I don’t really understand why either the departing crew don’t do a once-over, or a cleaning crew pop on board to do a quick tidy while we were on the ground. Overall, I like the LH PE service. I do not have other PE products to compare it with, but for me, it does what it says on the tin. Gives that little bit more attention and comfort to the economy traveller. Very well worth the extra cost.";POSITIVE

Transfer time was not enough at under an hour at Frankfurt as it is a huge airport but luckily the next flight was delayed anyway due to bad weather in EDI. This is an airline like they used to be, good food, friendly staff, comfy seats and lots of leg room. Only got a sandwich as short flight but what a sandwich, free tea with a cold drink also and refills as needed. Every thing on both flights went like clockwork with true German efficiency just like Aldi but with Waitrose quality. The food was handed out quickly but politely and the real clincher was the rubbish was collected at just the right time so as not to leave you with the tray down for ages. Even my grandchildren at 11 and 12 travelling with us were impressed. So on our many trips planned to Malta it's Lufthansa or bust, cost won't come into it but will allow at least 2 hours for transfer as can't gallop these days at over 60. It seems to me that these low cost airlines have dragged most of the others down to their level. Not Lufthansa though.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2016-05-30;"Flew Lufthansa from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. Lufthansa staff in Addis were visible and helpful at check-in. Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is ‘regular economy’. Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a PE seat but were soon informed that there is an ‘extra charge’ for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11.30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). To be honest, I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent night’s sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of PE if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey. LH PE is NOT a watered down C Class product. It is economy. However, the enhancements are good and sufficient to make me feel that it was money well spent and money well-saved from the full C class fare. I felt that I was an almost-premium passenger but was left in no doubt that the C class product (which could occasionally be peeked at through the curtains) was entirely superior - as it should be.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-05-29;" |  Addis Ababa to Frankfurt. Lufthansa Duty Station Manager was visible and helpful at check-in. Addis airport is the usual smoke-filled chaos it has always been. Repeated security checks make your journey through this airport frustrating. Welcome on-board was friendly and helpful. Premium economy seating is directly behind the business class cabin on the A330 (3 rows) with only a small 30cm partition hanging from the ceiling between you and the row behind, which is regular economy. If this is a well thought out marketing tool - I applaud LH, however I would prefer an entirely separate cabin with separate toilets (these became very dirty and did not appear to be attended to by the cabin crew for hours at a time). Some passengers from the economy section tried their luck by moving to a Premium economy seat but were soon informed that there is an ‘extra charge’ for that seat. They soon went back to their seats in economy. As this was a night flight with a stop in Jeddah we were offered a substantial snack just after take-off (at about 11:30pm local time) after which I settled in to sleep through the stop in JED if possible. The snack was a hot meal (I chose the vegetarian option) nicely presented on a small tray with chinaware and metal cutlery. A choice of wines was served in glasses and additionally, an amenity pack with all the basics you might need for the flight was provided (including those socks that no one ever, ever uses!). I have heard it said that the PE food service is identical to the economy offer. While I could not see what the passengers behind me were eating, the method of service is very different and you do feel that you are receiving an elevated standard of service. Prior to take off in Jeddah, welcome drinks were served (juice). I settled in for the night after that so missed the meal service and woke only for breakfast, which in itself tells you that the seat is comfortable enough to get a decent night’s sleep. The adjustable headrest with head support makes all the difference. If I am to offer a tip, take the first row of Premium economy if possible, on the aisle. These seats have extendable leg rests (not just the ones that are fitted to the seat in front of you) and so offer support to your entire leg/calves which makes for a more comfortable journey. LH PE is NOT a watered down C Class product. It IS economy. However, the enhancements are good and sufficient to make a ‘sky-snob’ like me feel that it was money well spent and (sorry Lufthansa) money well-saved from the full C class fare. I felt that I was a premium passenger but was left in no doubt that the C class product (which could occasionally be peeked at through the curtains) was entirely superior - as it should be.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-05-23;Prague to Toronto via Frankfurt. Lufthansa improved its economy class in recent years. I hadn't flown economy class on Lufthansa for at least 8 years and finally their got individual IFE screens. The movie selection is pretty limited but I really liked the live TV option. The flight attendants were reluctant to speak English to me. Drinks were served throughout the flight and were available in the galley at all times and the food as okay. Despite being over 6 feet tall I can't complain about the leg room and the flight arrived ahead of schedule.;POSITIVE

Check in opened 4 hours before departure and were polite and patient. Lounge in EZE fail to deliver on food. Champagne (Argentinean) only after request. For premium economy, only better and more spacious seating is offered – and a ridiculous amenity kit, good for nothing. Food and drinks very limited, small portions, same as for normal economy. Only meat/protein option was chicken. FA professional and genuine. Both flights on time. Senator lounge in FRA surprisingly good food and drinks, but very crowded.

Staff was very friendly and helpful and interacted with the passengers. One of the best, if not the best crew with whom I have flown so far. Seats comfortable and spacious for this type of aircraft, the seats a little bit thinner than in older A321 so we had more legroom. Food was tasty, just a sandwich, a chocolate, drink and coffee but it was fresh and tasty. There was a wide selection of beverages on board, and for those wanting to shop the in flight catalogue. I have to say I wasn't supposed to fly Lufthansa but Brussels Airlines but due to the events prior on Zaventem airport and the french air controlers strike I had to be rebooked, and Lufthansa was simply amazing at finding me another flight. Fast, simple, efficient and nice.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-05-15;" |  Sao Paulo to Nagoya via Frankfurt. I've been flying with Lufthansa before, and I am not usually bothered by their service in general. But this time, I decided to request diabetic food.  I have always been afraid of diabetes meals, since they are usually tasteless and disappointing. Whatever that was, it was by no means a diabetic meal, no matter the DB they may print on the coverage. Specifically, the flights leaving Frankfurt. I've attached the photo of a meal. A plate full of carbohydrates (potatoes) and that is it. The onboard crew was very attentive and understanding, and provided me with other option of normal food they had available and that was much more like DB meal, for me. So, besides the supposed DB meal I have no complains at all. I would recommend the airline with caution for that point. So, if you are diabetic and will fly with Lufthansa, don't even bother asking for special meal.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-05-09;"Singapore to Frankfurt return with Lufthansa. The A380 Premium Economy seats are extremely comfy and the size of the entertainment screen and programs offered were excellent, as was the food and welcome juice. I was addressed by name and crew were chatty, caring and efficient. The seats are located on the lower deck right at the front with your own toilets and a curtain behind you to separate you from Economy. The galley is also in that section and there were plenty of 'midnight snacks and always drinks and crew available and happy to chat. Premium Economy comes with 2 × 23kg check - in baggage allowance too, so shopping in Germany was not a problem. The 500ml bottle of water in each seat on arrival as well as a funky amenity kit and hot towels were appreciated. Highly recommended product. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-04-29;" |  Lufthansa A321 business class on 4 hour flight from Frankfurt to Cairo is basically economy seat rows with the middle seat blocked off. There is no entertainment system unless you down load an app on your phone / notebook, and no charging facilities. This is a rip off and competes with some airlines that offer widebody business class, seats and entertainment. LH have had a special fare for this route for months which is about 20% lower than the other airline, and when you work for a major company with travel policies they will of course go with the cheapest option. I feel Lufthansa are charging a pseudo business class fare for economy. I will do everything I can not to fly with them again. I sent LH feedback but of course no response.";NEGATIVE

Upon check-in at LH counters I asked if I could have my ticket changed to an earlier flight even though I was booked on a restricted ticket. The LH agent changed my reservation to the earliest possible flight which was leaving 40 minutes after I had completed my check-in. Great service! Onboard I was greeted by name. Crew extremely friendly and caring. Seats comfy and the typical intra euro layout, fine for me. Lunch was served after take-off, a small meal but of very good quality. Different kinds of teas were offered. I gladly chose the green tea. Arrival on time. All in all an excellent flight with Lufthansa.";POSITIVE

Onboard the service was solid Lufthansa quality on all sectors with competent crews plus sandwiches and drinks as usual, but the fact that we were bussed from and to aircraft at Munich and Frankfurt made the transfers quite tedious. The highlight was the plane change at FRA where we arrived at around gates A1-A2 by bus, walked all the way to gate A69 in the newest terminal extension (T1) and realized that we're bussed back to around gates A1-A2 where the A321 to Helsinki was waiting for us. 9/10 for their solid performance and 4/10 for the transfer arrangements between flights, it was so hot and unpleasant in the buses.";POSITIVE

I do get that fly attendants are not waiters but trained professional here to assure our security, but having them smile is much appreciated. We were a bit late, it may be only 20 minutes but it shortened my connecting time. Second flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong was not good. Being served last and not having a choice of meal is something I do not care about. I was pretty close to the galley and could hear FA's chatting/giggling very loudly for most of the flight, and they should have cared a bit more. Most of them were quite cold and they were not serving drinks enough. The seats weren't comfortable, and once the front seat reclines it feels way too cramped, I was surprised it could be reclined that much. Sit back and enjoy the Lufthansa entertainment programme is more like sit back and enjoy your own device. I thought I read they updated their IFE not long ago, well it looks more like they gave it a vintagy feel with movies from 90'.  So I would rate Lufthansa as my worst flying experience and  don't recommend them.";NEGATIVE

I couldn't contact them because they open at 7:00 am and not all their numbers work at weekends.

Fortunately I was able to catch an earlier flight to make my connection. This was only possible because I arrived at the airport 4 hours in advance. The check in staff falsely said that my Indian visa was expired. When they realized that it was not expired, they said that it was a false visa. Post lots of discussion, they finally concluded that the visa was valid, however wanted me to show them my return flight, which is absurd because I live in India and have a working visa.

I was quite surprised however, with the flight attendants and their lack of helpfulness/friendliness. I had to catch a connection in Munich and since our flight was delayed, I asked the attendant if she knew when we would now be landing. She glared at me and told me ""I should have listened to the announcement the captain made"" and walked away. To be clear, the announcement was inaudible, which is why I called her over for clarification. I was very polite and (I think) within my rights to ask a flight attendant such a simple question.

The connection flight from Milan was good, efficient, but delayed by 30 minutes (because of security issues in Frankfurt). Cabin crew assured me that the connection in Frankfurt with 1 hour would be guaranteed. In Frankfurt the Lufthansa first class treatment took off. At the remote parking a Mercedes Limo was waiting to drive me to the First Lounge. Then the Transfer to the A380 was done in a Cayenne Porsche, the staff took my luggage and guided me with special lift and passage directly to the first class cabin of A380. And all with no fuss, no problem attitude by friendly drivers. The First cabin is open designed with enough privacy, very comfortable seats and again highly motivated, efficient and friendly staff. Presentation and quality of food was very good, the wine list was excellent, although unfortunately no German Red, but two grand whyte wines from Germany instead. All in all a truly First class experience which does not limit itself to the aircraft but as well on the ground.";POSITIVE

Mobile check-in using LH app was easy but luggage drop-off was a bit slow due a large passengers group checking in just before me. Refurbished and clean A340-600 with new IFE screens with good content, nice food and beverages, professional and welcoming crew who always give great service and make me feel like a guest, not only a passenger. On-time arrival in MUC, layover was spent in business lounge at H gates. Breakfast in the lounge was adequate with both hot and cold options, fruits, diary products, full bar and fast wifi internet. Clean and comfortable CRJ9 to Zagreb boarded from remote gate. Tasty and very nice presented brunch served for this 1h flight with 2 FAs checking am I happy with everything on the flight every time they pass by. I am impressed with consistency of Lufthansa on-board and ground services and gradual improvements made to remain competitive.

lufthansa;2016-04-05;"Doha to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. Lufthansa has added a stop in Kuwait on the way to FRA presumably to fill seats since it has competition on this route from Qatar Airways A350. The A330-300 from Doha was very comfortable and food much better than the longer flight to LAX. This is an extra journey with layover and takes over 25 hours. The bathrooms in the A380 behind row 15 are small and spartan for business class. At six per row, the seats are not that wide and you get reasonably intimate with total strangers. In spite of all the fuss about new menu based on flyer preferences, the offerings were nothing to crow about. Portions tend to me on the cuisine minceur size.  Snacks came about midflight and consisted of small servings. When I asked if could have two, ""just choose one now, we may not have enough,"" was the reply. Two minutes later an extra snack was handed. There was no announcement about a bar on the upper deck or snacks/fruits available in the galley. WIFI was available but not free in business class. It was easy to use and reasonably fast. In spite of the little glitches, Lufthansa has the best FA's in the industry. They are have a good sense of humor, always willing to assist and above all extremely dignified.";POSITIVE

Although I usually try to travel with only hand baggage, this time I went to a congress and had checked a bag. At Madrid airport trying to report missing Luggage is not easy but I had the paperwork done and went to the hotel. They told me that they had located my bag in Munich and that it would arrive with the later flight that evening in Madrid and they would notify me. But I did not hear anything. Next morning I contacted them and trying to be in touch by telephone is really difficult. But I heard that the bag was send from Munich but ""never arrived in Madrid"". I was told to contact Lufthansa Germany but there is no way to do so. Finally, the person at the Madrid airport connected me to a man in Germany and he was very supportive and understanding. He promised that they would do everything to locate the bag. I filled in form after form, online and on paper, describing the content of my bag and the specifics which could help to identify it. But the day after I went to a shop and bought new clothes. The luggage never arrived and at home I tried again to contact Lufthansa but there is simply nobody that you can speak to. After 9 weeks (and many  unanswered mails) I received a mail that they would pay me ""without further proof"" an amount of money that was not even 25% of the lost items and also not any reimbursement for the stuff I had to buy in Madrid. I send again several mails because I did want to know how they came to that (low) amount of money but never received any reply. And then the worst: the money they said to transfer has never been transferred to my account!

The cabin staff for flight from Berlin to Frankfurt were polite, friendly and helpful. Lufthansa seat is comfortable for both legs. It has almost around 32 inches. The flight from Frankfurt to Bangkok was really enjoyable. We arrived in Bangkok 20 minutes earlier than schedules. Our baggages came fast at the bagage claim area. Overall, it was good to choose this airline for long flight. The negative things were only for the flight Frankfurt to Bangkok. The inflight entertainment from Frankfurt to Bangkok was poor (old movies, old songs) and lack of attention from the cabin crew. ";POSITIVE

The first flight, from Pisa, was quick and easy, leaving on time, with respectful crew and beverages. No entertainment options on this flight because it is only a quick regional 1-hour flight. Had 1:25 minutes to catch the long international flight. The A340-600 that was used for the 9-hour flight was splendid. The seats were comfortable, as I was seated in 45k, which is the second row of economy. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) worked great, with the touchscreen functionality being as smooth as any tablet, unlike most planes. Very good selection of movies, and TV shows and games were also available. Food was great, giving plentiful food that left me satisfied during the entire voyage. We arrived in Chicago 10 minutes in advance, even though we left 10 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was as efficient as boarding.

lufthansa;2016-03-17;"Amsterdam to Tokyo Haneda via Frankfurt. On March 15, Lufthansa had overbooked the flight to Tokyo Haneda and were asking for volunteers to take a later ANA flight. I volunteered, but it took the Lufthansa staff at the gate a long time to decide that it was not possible for me to change the flight and this marred the boarding process. The service was not good for Lufthansa. For example, one half of the section of the plane where I was sitting (at the back) received meal menus, but not the other half. The meals were reasonable, but the seat was narrow and the meal trays so small that it was difficult for me to eat without spilling anything. And the staff kept bumping the meal trolleys against my elbows as they passed. The plane was one of Lufthansa's new 747s and I expected the seats to be wider and more comfortable. The other segments of the flight were better. The flight from Amsterdam to Frankfurt was very smooth and the cabin crew combined great efficiency with being pleasant also. The cabin crew on the Tokyo flight seemed less efficient and depended where you were seated. The flight from Haneda to Hiroshima  was a 787 operated by ANA. The seat seemed wider, with more legroom on this 90-minute flight than on the 747 used for LH 993 to Haneda.";POSITIVE

I opted not to eat the meal and the FA gave me several picks of cashew nuts without being asked. FA's were efficient but not overly friendly. My inquiry/request for a real glass was tersely dismissed by the service director even though she offered them to the passengers sitting across the aisle. Seats were OK for relatively short flights and there was no IFE on either leg. Baggage was delivered promptly upon arrival in Ankara. I cannot fault Lufthansa for either of the flights but having to take a bus to and from the plane every time I travel in and out of Munich is becoming a real annoyance.";POSITIVE

Boarding and service at the counters was very good. However, service in the air was kind of forced compared to outbound flight. Allthough Lufthansa flight attendants are very service minded, a few stressed through the dinner serving. A rather ordinary meal (chicken and rice is not a highlight when you have been travelling in rural South America for several weeks). We hardly managed dinner before everything was collected. IFE as good as usual. Seats felt narrower and harder than on the outbound flight on an A340-600, being similar to the rather unconfortable on Boeing 777 in 3-4-3 arrangement used by some airlines.

IFE great, especially movie section which even managed to present more obscure movies. as a Dane I appreciated no less than 4 Danish movies. Audio acceptable too. Seats very comfortable, felt broader and softer than the newer ones on wide-bodied Boeing aircraft. Two hours before landing, breakfast was served.

lufthansa;2016-03-08;"First time to use Lufthansa new Premium Economy on this long 12 hr flight to Cancun. The seat comfort is a mayor plus compared to the standard Economy Class. Nowadays there are so many Premium Economy or Economy Plus concepts that you don't know what to expect. Lufthansa has done a great job. It's an almost independent class with very comfy seats. The seat offers 18 cm more legroom, is wider and has a relatively big tray table (comparable to that one in Business Class), power sockets and IFE on high definition touch screens. The service was very professional, friendly and efficent. The purser of this flight welcomed us personally. On this A340 the Premium Economy consists of only 19 seats and has it's own compartment. It is quiet and you can deboard quickly after arrival. The food is almost the same than in Economy Class, but served on china and with a menu and some real glasses. After boarding you get a non-alcoholic juice cocktail. Food quality and quantity was fine. You get plenty of drinks. IFE and WIFI worked also really good. At your seat there is a water bottle and nice amenity kit. The flight was almost one hour ahead of schedule. It was a great experience. If the price difference is not too big, compared to Economy, I would not hesitate to fly this class again.";POSITIVE

We departed more or less on time, something of a minor miracle at Frankfurt where you frequently feel that you've driven halfway to your destination before you reach the runway. We were upstairs on the A380 which was pleasant. The upstairs economy cabin is relatively small (only 40 or so seats) and feels quiet and relaxed. The seats were OK, not the best legroom and a touch on the narrow side, but not too bad. I would certainly recommend trying to get seats upstairs on the A380. The entertainment system worked well with a reasonable choice. The food was dreadful - other airlines manage to serve meals that taste of something, it's about time that Lufthansa managed to do the same.

The food was much better than expected - on the leg from Munich to Shanghai, the menu featured a dish from the chef at the Pudong Shangri-La, one of Shanghai's top hotels. I also enjoyed the snack sandwiches and chocolates. Service from the flight attendants was very professional and standard. In-flight entertainment was sufficiently current. Nice new airplane with a separate lower floor for the bathrooms, limiting line ups and waiting passengers in the aisles. My only complaint was the seating: The legroom was quite cramped - my knees touched the seat in front of me if I reclined, and I am only 165cm. The padding on the seating was also a bit thin, and I could feel the seam stitching on the seat through my clothing.

The seat is indeed comfortable and well cushioned and even for a 12,5 hrs flight the comfort and room offered is sufficient. Especially the cabin on the A380 is nice as it feels more private due to the separation from the main economy cabin. I had ordered a special asian vegetarian meal which was very tasty. The crew was attentive, chatty and smiling. They go the extra mile and make one feel very welcome. As I am a Senator with Lufthansa , greeted by the purser prior to departure and engaged in a nice short conversation. The inflight entertainement offers a wide range of classics as well as new releases. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-03-01;"Enjoyable flight from Copenhagen to Frankfurt with Lufthansa A321 with good seats, a sandwich and the usual excellent service on inter-European short-haul flights. Frankfurt airport clean and easy transfer. Return from Seoul the new seats in economy are the worst long-haul seats I've experienced. Leg room, lumbar and neck support poor with fixex armrests. And the passenger in front reclined her seat the full voyage. I had booked mextra leg-room seats, but as the A380 was not available on this flight, I recieved a windowless seat on their 747-8. The staff, though, were second to none.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-29;"Delhi to Munich with Lufthansa - an 8 hour delay and it wasn't a great experience. Ground staff not very helpful, onboard staff very kind and efficient. Seat was ok - the plane wasn't full, so had 2 seats to myself. Food was awful, booked oriental vegetarian (so not get any dairy) and ended up with a snack box containing cheese lasagna and 2 spring rolls. Luckily they had cashew nuts which turned to be my only food.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-28;"Not a real business class on a four hour plus route from Frankfurt to Tel Aviv. Basically an economy seat with a table between. Service no different than coach. A total waste - at very high $. Lounge in Frankfurt was stuffed with people, minimal snacks. My last time using Lufthansa Business.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-28;"I used Lufthansa 2 times in February on same route Budapest-Frankfurt and return. I have a Senator card and even though I used economy class they tagged my luggage with priority and they offered priority boarding. Pretty poor food, cake and one type of sandwich. This year they raised the fares and cut the service, and you have to pay for checked luaggage but overall they are still one of the better airlines.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-25;"Budapest to Frankfurt. Efficient, convenient, good experience just like all flights with Lufthansa.

No delay, perfect timing.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-24;"I had a very pleasant flight on Lufthansa from Dubai to Frankfurt. The flight was quite full and we departed on time. Each seat has Bose noise cancelling headphones installed. You get a pillow and a big blanket. The food was decent enough, they offered canapés after takeoff and breakfast before landing -  the flight takes off at 1:30 and lands around 6am, usually people don't eat anything at that time. The crew was very welcoming and attentive. They offered me to move to another seat where I had no neighbor. Overall the staff made passengers feel very comfy on board. The only thing that bothers me is the headrest of the seats. It makes sleeping very difficult. We arrived ahead of schedule and baggage was dilvered quickly. Ground service in Dubai is okay but not as good as in Frankfurt. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-24;"I flew from Frankfurt to Seattle with Lufthansa (LH 490). Boeing 747-400 with a rather old cabin. The seat provided a very decent legroom, so the comfort was sufficient to me. Cabin crew was outstandingly nice, although a stewardess adressed me always in English and the american woman next to me in German, which was quite funny. The food delivered was delicious and drinks were available to all passengers during the entire flight. IFE selection was really poor, but I watched a nice film and therefore, the selection was ok for me. IFE was slow, but as I heard it from a friend of mine working with Lufthansa, they updated it. Flight on time, cabin very clean - overall a nice experience! I highly recommend to fly with Lufthansa on both short and long-haul flights.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-23;"Extremely unimpressed with Lufthansa's version of Premium Economy at a rather large price mark-up over Economy. Not made to feel special in any way on our flight from London Heathrow to Cape Town. Section still in Economy, only denoted by a tiny pull-down screen so you might just as well be in Economy. Food exactly the same as Economy. No breakfast rolls loaded in Munich, but Economy had them. Paper cups for heaven's sake. What airline is this? The only advantage was enhanced legroom, and that is all. Never ever again. BA's version far superior.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-22;Sao Paulo to Frankfurt. The new Business class in Lufthansa is not a good experience. Narrow seats that are angled in a weird way - very uncomfortable in sitting position and narrow when lying down. The toilets are small with shaped walls so not even the toilet seats can stay up. The food is okay but I did not find it up to standard compared with other airlines. ;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-21;"The service on Lufthansa from Mumbai to Frankfurt was fantastic. Being on the Boeing 747 upper deck makes it a little special and service was impeccable. The flight attendants were attentive and took care of us. FRA to SFO was on an A380 which is not very personal. The upper deck has a lot of seats and so you don't fell like anything special. Flight attendants were attentive, pleasant and helpful. Food mediocre at best. Not that impressive and on the FRA to SFO portions were small. Beverages offered a great selection. Connection in FRA was not as efficient as I'd expect.";POSITIVE

However the return flight was very good.";POSITIVE

Typically German, everything on time, everything considered, from entertainement, seat ergonomics, service and punctuality.

lufthansa;2016-02-06;"Dublin to Bangkok via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. My husband and I booked the flight earlier last year, then they changed our flight 3 times! The transit time was incredibly long when they first changed, then we changed back to a better timing which suit us. Then they changed the flight time again both trip. I was not able to change back to a better time because they said I already changed once and if I would like to change I need to pay 150 Euro fee per person. It was not my choice. I contacted to many by many methods but no reply. Then I realized that my seats that I bought disappeared from the system and I did not receive any refund and no reply. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-06;"The Lufthansa flight from Munich to Helsinki was quite empty and I was able to secure a seat behind a flight attendant's seat near emergency exits, which had extra legroom. The seats were leather, and the plane was in good condition and clean. Boarding was through automated self-service gates, making the process smooth and quick. Lufthansa still offers complimentary food and drink aboard intra-Europe flights, which is a nice gesture. The food was a sandwich, which was unnecessary for me so I declined, but a free beer was nice to have. Flight attendants were very friendly throughout. The flight was late due to de-icing, but this wasn't Lufthansa's fault. A minor gripe is the lack of any screens in the cabin, so there is no indication as to how far the flight has progressed.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-02-04;"Rome to Houston via Frankfurt, and Lufthansa is a great airline. Lounge in Rome was handling Avia Lounge that wasn't really satisfying. Rome to Frankfurt, the service was great and the food, very tasty. Cabin crew is one of the kindest I've ever dealt with. I had a 3 hours layover so I went to the Business class lounge in Frankfurt. Good food selection and great service. Finally, the long flight from Frankfurt to Houston. Amazing service, great seats and good food. The wifi isn't free for the Business Class cabin.";POSITIVE

Comfortable plane with excellent service and in-flight entertainment, many films in several languages​​, TV shows, documentaries and music.

This is the first time with Lufthansa flight which I havent been served with aftermeal drink.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-28;Lufthansa is recommended on this route. Paris-Munich-Paris are short flights with great service. Cabin crew were courteous and served drinks several times and snacks are also available. Munich-Tbilisi-Munich is a long flight 3.5-4 hours. The seats are comfy for a 4 hour flight. Lufthansa offers hot dinner (MUC-TBS) and hot breakfast (TBS-MUC) which were very good quality and quantity. The staff delivered an excellent service on both ways. Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines offer good service on this route and these companies are good value for money.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-27;"One again a perfect experience with Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Berlin Tegel. Nice business lounge. Depature exactly on schedule and arrival 10 mins ahead of schedule. New A321. Obviously LH fills Economy and leaves lots of space in the Business compartment (before the flexible curtain) so most of Business passengers had their ""own"" row, which made the flight really relaxing. Food and service very nice. There's no better way to fly (at least domestic).";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-26;"As expected Lufthansa offered a very good product between Frankfurt and Vienna. Booked on LH website, which is one of the best. The price was rather expensive (holiday season), although the flights were only 2/3 full. All flights were on time, check in and boarding were smooth. Cabin crew was friendly and professional. A big plus at Frankfurt airport is that you can enjoy hot drinks and a selction of newspapers for free at LH gates. One new feature that Lufthansa offers is the new entertainment app. You can enjoy movies, TV shows, music channels and the flight map on your smartphone or tablet but make sure to download the app before the flight. App worked well on the flight, I enjoyed the music channels and flight map, but flight time was too short to watch a movie.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-24;"Although I am generally very happy with Lufthansa standard, this flight from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt was not one of their best ones. The seats were comfortable and rather spacious, there was a choice of two menus for dinner and no choice for breakfast. IFE was OK, although if you fly two long haul flights a month you will start to feel the limited choice in the movie selection. The cabin crew was generally good, although one was unsuitable for his job: it is the first time that a steward pushes me on my shoulder while I am eating and tells me ""do you want something to drink?"" Overall, the airpline was quiet and a comfortable flight.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-24;"Our Lufthansa flight to London Heathrow was supposed to leave at 7 am from Frankfurt, but ground staff announced it would be delayed because of de-icing. Although this might be a standard procedure for large airports in winter, especially for the second half of january whene traffic is not very high, it took surprisingly long to board the plane, and ground staff did not provide very clear indications for boarding sequency. We took off from Frankfurt at 8.19am. Overall the flight was comfortable, with a comfy seat and little turbulence. We spent some time circling over London before landing at Heathrow. The cabin crew was very good and we were served drinks and food onboard, where we had a choice of cereals or sandwich. A good selection for a short-haul flight.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-24;"After flying different airlines in the last months I noticed on this Washington Dulles to Hamburg (via Frankfurt) flight how good Lufthansa is, even in Economy Class. In IAD an organized boarding, the Lufthansa lounge is a great place to refresh and have dinner before the night flight. Seat comfort is okay and seat pitch is acceptable. IFE extensive and improved with a good working system. A plus is the wifi Flynet onboard, and USD 12.95 for 24 hrs is a reasoanble price. The staff onboard were professional and efficient. Shortly after takeoff they served drinks with a snack, 20 minutes later hot towels and then a hot and very decent, tasty dinner. The light concept of this Boeing 747-8 is great! One hour before landing in Frankfurt they gave us a continental breakfast with fruit, muffin, granola bar and hot/cold drinks. For a 7 hour flight a good and impeccable service. Transfer in Frankfurt was okay, change to onward flight to Hamburg took 15 minutes. The short 45 minutes leg to HAM was fine, too. They served cookies and a full bar for free. Staff were professional, friendly. Bags arrived fine to. A really good price (490 Euros return) for a great experience in Economy Class.";POSITIVE

There were also holders in the front of ours seats with fresh bottles of water. The inflight entertainment was good. You could even click to see a live camera from several views outside of the plane. Drinks and food were regularly offered also. It was a long trip made very comfortable and enjoyable. Thank you Lufthansa. I will definitely fly with you again!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-17;"I needed to travel with my family from Frankfurt to Hamburg and unless you are prepared to go by train or rent a car (abt 500km) LH is the only option. Being aware of this monopoly they charge outrageous fares, for the chosen dates the cheapest return ticket was EUR 260 per person. When booking online, by mistake I booked the return flight not one month later, but one year later. When I noticed the error I immediately contacted LH, but due to office closure hours etc. was only able to actually speak to someone more than 24 hrs after booking and was then told that I could only correct the return flight by paying an additional EUR65 change fee per Person (and additional cost as the corrected return date would only be available at an even higher tariff) – the ticket price per person for this less than 1hr flight would have reached astronomical heights of more than EUR 400 per Person. The only other option would be to file an online complaint (they don’t take complaints by phone) asking for a waiver of the change fee. I went down that option and now one month later I still have not received any reply from them, seemingly they just have too many complaints. The flight was as good or bad as any low cost carrier, chaotic boarding in FRA, no room for hand luggage, seat pitch seems rather cramped and not exactly friendly service. My conclusion is that this airline is not at all interested in providing any sort of customer service.";NEGATIVE

During my outbound flights on same route (LHR-FRA-HKG), baileys/cognac were served at the end of the dinner, but no service on the inbound flight. The internet service packs and announcements were available on outbound flight while these did not happen on the inbound journey. Cabin attendants nice and helpful.

I found the food disgusting and there is no real separation from economy.";POSITIVE

My seatback moved backwards once you lean back. ";NEGATIVE

Staff was professional and the sandwiches provided during the flight quite good. The Airbus planes operated for the flights between Paris and Frankfurt were new, hence, they were in good condition and also clean. But what really impressed me were the Boeing planes that were operated for the flights between Wrocław and Frankfurt. These were old B737-400 planes, but they were in excellent condition and super clean, with leather comfortable seats and a nice vintage-like feeling that is hard to explain.";POSITIVE

Given that week I had flown out to San Francisco and back to London, 2 days later flying from London to Seoul this just made my day. Space was great, I'm nearly 2 meters in height and over 100kgs, plus I carry a lot gadgets with me all the time. I had the window seat as well so got the side storage area. The lead cabin member was incredibly nice, friendly and always highly professional in her responsibilities. The tv screen was big, the seat was fully adjustable into the flat position. Good leg support and the width was great never felt cramped in and plenty of a gap between myself and passenger next me. Length wise I could fully recline in my seat, fully stretch out my legs and cross them, I have long legs and there was still plenty of room. The inflight media center was great, lack a bit on the tv side through but a good wide variety of movies, shame they had not been many good movies out recently when I flew. For games still bring your iPad or tablet through. Food was great a good selection and quality menu handed to you. Actually for once an inflight fill me up and I was actually feeling a bit stuffed. Non stop service of beverages constantly offered. But I do not drink on flights so glad to they had stock up on apple juice. My only slight area to improve is the overall seat comfort level, it was quite hard on a long haul flight, the air suspension just worked on firmness not comfort.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-08;"Delhi to Munich in June 2015. Surprised to see Lufthansa's latest business class product onboard. The only difference between the A340-600 and the A380 is the lack of space in the former, making it feel very congested while seated.

Beef goulash very tender and tasty and accompanied by a fabulous French Bordeaux that staff were efficient to refill!

Direct boarding to plane was a real comfort.

The seating was fine, the choice of films and TV, fine. The food is odd - if you're going for dairy free, it's just bizarre combinations of tasteless food (chicken casserole with potatoes and overcooked glass noodles). However, it all went wrong when I got into LCY to discover that my luggage had gone to Heathrow. Something about the plane only taking the first 15 pieces of luggage and weight restrictions. Also that they could either take the luggage or the passengers.  However, it went from bad to worse as it has been 2 days and my luggage still hasn't arrived. Well, it did - at 1am this morning but was taken away when nobody answered the door. How very selfish of me not cooperating with the courier for being awake at 1am following a long haul flight. I'm pretty furious and now have to take another day off work in case my luggage arrives today. I tweeted Lufthansa and they've been no help at all.";NEGATIVE

For someone who just occasionally flies in business I have just praise. Seat was very comfortable, I managed to sleep 3hrs after very nice lunch. AVOD is excellent, I really enjoy LH audio selection. I was most impressed with service, the FAs kept to high standards, with service in an non-intrusive manner and a sense of humor.

lufthansa;2016-01-06;"Frankfurt to London City. Lufthansa is usually an okay airline, but this flight was a disaster. When we landed at LCY we found out the pilot decided not to take almost any luggage on a fully booked flight as it would have been too heavy for the regional jet. Staff were not particularly apologetic at LCY, just herded people to fill out forms and promised bags will be delivered by next morning, which turned out to be a lie as bags still have not turned up yet the next evening. They outsourced this task to an appalling company that even they can not contact as they never pick the phone up or respond to emails. They also booked us (family of 4) in rows 3, 27 and 28, even though since this was a connecting flight this was done 15 hours before the flight, not a last minute check in.  Very disappointing as we have been flying with them regularly.";NEGATIVE

Service was alright, food was tasty even though you can tell that LH wants to save cost. I sometimes think it would be good to sell proper food instead of handing out tiny portions for free. We had the inflight app, so luckily we could watch some movies on our devices. If you don't have those there is no entertainment. I would still rate as good since you feel safe on LH.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-04;"Our flight to Rio de Janeiro from Frankfurt was delayed from 2200 in the evening to 0900 in the morning. Lufthansa couldn't provide a hotel because there are no hotels in the transit zone of Frankfurt airport, we had to sleep in the airport in the couches because we had no Schengen visa. The staff from Lufthansa sent us to zone B saying there is some sleeping area there, but there is nothing similar to that. He said that restaurants are open whole night there but that wasn't true and only 1 shop was working. On the flight back a flight attendant was rude, another one forgot we asked for tea. Food was poor, vegetarian pasta or chicken is not what I expect on a long flight. Sandwiches on the flight from Frankfurt to London were okay. We bought tickets well in advance and they were cheaper than others.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-03;Munich to Hong Kong in business class. Like the new business class cabin of Lufthansa very much. Find the seats very comfy and like the colour scheme. Was greeted by a friendly flight attendant on entering the aircraft. Shortly after that greeted by name by the purser. Welcome drink was served by your 'new' personal flight attendant. On this route LH has introduced the enhanced restaurant service. Guess it is a very nice new touch but it didn't work out at all on this flight. Seemed like it was the first time for the team as the purser kept telling them what to do and they seemed pretty overwhelmed with the additional work. Overwhelmed and stressed with a warm smile though. The restaurant service will probably be a nice addition once the crews are trained. Other than that it was another great flight experience. Have been a Senator with Lufthansa for almost 15 years. After some years if downgrading I am very happy to see how much they have improved their entire product. Also entertainment offered a wide choice of current blockbusters. Only minor complaintn is still the quality of the catering. ;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-03;"Hong Kong to Frankfurt. First time on Lufthansa Premium Economy and I really like the product. The seat is very comfy and gives enough room. Seat cushion is soft and allows to be comfortable even on a 12.5 hrs flight. Screen has a decent size, amenity kit is almost the same like in business class, crew warm and attentive. Onboard the A380 the premium economy cabin is separated from economy cabin which is very nice and creates a more exclusive touch. Food is the same like economy but served on china, which adds quality to the catering. Cabin was full but didn't feel cramped. Find Premium economy a great alternative to business if the fare is good. Had a good 8 hrs sleep and arrived well rested. Would recommend.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-02;"Even for a short flight the business class service from London to Frankfurt was hard to rival. The service at Heathrow Terminal 2 was seamless and the Lufthansa lounge was fully replenished with options of a full continental or English breakfast, alcohol and was wonderfully quiet. The food quality was excellent and the staff attentive throughout. Onboard the cabin staff were very polite, a light meal was served with other refreshments and they addressed everybody by surname and provided newspapers and also assisted with any connection queries, bags etc. Overall a flawless service which I will gladly repeat.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-02;"Flew with Lufthansa on flight to Berlin via Frankfurt from Singapore using its A380 and A320. The first leg SIN to FRA, I sat in premium economy cabin seat no 56H. I got a chance to bid an upgrade to premium economy class by online. In my opinion, the premium economy class is not better than the normal economy class. The advantages are only more space and more attention from the cabin crews on what you need during the flight (such as more foods/beverages, add blanket). The meal was OK. I had pre-ordered a meal, but the cabin crew did not notice it. Thus I had to ask and wait my meal. The seat was good and comfortable. I could recline it much more to the back. For the value of money, upgarde to premium economy for long route (more than 10 hours flight) is worth. The flight entertainment was not spectacular and contains old movies. Inter German flight from Frankfurt to Berlin was using A320 which is a normal flight and nothing special as it is only 50 minutes.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-02;"Frankfurt to Houston with a same day connection from Delhi, got a chance to refresh in Lufthansa'a Business Lounge. Got to admit, despite being a long flight, I barely felt any fatigue and slept like a baby. Seats were comfortable, food served onboard was light on the stomach and of pristine quality. Service was okay, inflight entertainment was out of this world. Landed in Houston, completely relaxed.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2016-01-02;"Delhi to Frankfurt, A380 had the new business class product from Lufthansa, which can be found onboard the 747-8i and some of the refitted A340-600s. All in all, the service was good, food was good, entertainment choices were better than most airlines, seats were comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. Had extra storage cabinets next to my seat, which was very convenient.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-30;"London to Incheon via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. We were delayed by around 1 hour because of another plane having to land in an emergency and missed our connection to Seoul. However, Lufthansa provided us with free meals and accommodation and we even got to have a look around Frankfurt. Due to a faulty A380, our plane to Incheon was delayed by another 3 hours. Having said that, the food was very tasty, crew were very nice and helpful and I had a large selection of movies and programmes to watch. Also, ride was very smooth but I give credit to the pilot and plane.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-25;"Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Frankfurt. My flight was delayed by one day due to Lufthansa pilot strike on 9 October 2015, which caused inconvenience. However, I appreciate the fact that the airline / airport effectively arranged 5 Star hotel to stay overnight and arranged taxis to and from the hotel. They executed it very efficiently, well done! The flight crew were very nice.  I found the flight went smoothly but I found the meals rather inadequate. It was a 12.5 hour flight. We were given a meal about an hour after take off and had to wait about 8 hours for the next meal which was very snacky and inadequate. I have no problems with the beverages, it is just the inadequacy of food that was the problem.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-24;"Mumbai to Dresden via Munich. The experience on Lufthansa A330s is always quite good, as its 2-4-2 seating never make it really crowded (assuming you are at either of the sides) and hence easy for you to access literally anything, from food to the washrooms. The cabin crew were quite decent on the onward trip, but we had a really great Indian flight attendant on the return journey who amused us and a foreign student group by some hilarious taking-for-a-ride story. Nice to see a personal touch with the service. IFE was good too, but suffered a hitch on the way back. Thankfully, no one complained too much about it and the staff explained it quite patiently to us. Luggage handling is always efficient, and this was exemplified by the fact that my return journey had only a 35 minute layover at Munich, and that the bags arrived fine at Mumbai. Good food, too, though they might consider increasing it to two full meals per flight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-23;"Seemed a good flight as usual with Lufthansa. Then we got to Munich, very foggy but landed with no issues. Issues started when we got to the other plane to Wrocław. We waited in the bus for 30 min, no information whatsoever. The pilot came over to apologise, plane broke down, in the meantime got the text message from Lufthansa with the same information. We swap the planes, all was well organised. Munich to Wroclaw pilot apologised for lack of sandwiches, but it was either wait for the sandwiches or make it to Wrocław Airport which was closing shortly after midnight. It got the passengers into Christmas mood, sharing the sandwiches between each other. Would always recommend, even if things go wrong they do work on it and even manage to make people laugh.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-23;"Great service, good food on Lufthansa from Newark to London City via Frankfurt. Baggage not on belt on arrival at LCY, with a 55hr delay in delivery. This after Lufthansa had cancelled a Star Alliance RTW business class itinerary, with comment that what had occurred was not possible. Questionable systems and poor communication. Their website for delayed baggage not updated fast enough, and a sense that customers have to drive communication.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-21;"Delhi to Boston via Frankfurt. On the first leg of my trip, Delhi to Frankfurt, I requested a gluten-free meal. Although the meal I was served was labeled gluten-free, it contained foods with wheat. I alerted the stewardess and she was sympathetic but had nothing else that she could serve me other than fruit. When I changed planes in Frankfurt, I notified the staff at the next gate what had happened and requested that someone onboard actually look at the food for the Frankfurt to Boston segment to make sure that it was gluten-free. I upgraded my ticket in Frankfurt to premium economy and everything was well-handled from that point on. However, this not should have happened regardless of what type of ticket I had.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-21;"Helsinki to Kuala Lumpur via Frankfurt, returning from Singapore to Helsinki via Frankfurt, and Lufthansa didn't disappoint this time. I like the service concept onboard, IFE offering a nice selection of entertainment. Economy meals quite good to be honest. Was on row 95 on SIN-FRA (A380, upper deck) lots of legroom and a small quiet economy cabin behind business class. It was maybe the smoothest and most comfortable long-haul flight in economy ever.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-20;"The inflight experience with LH was fairly positive, but ground experience was terrible. The first issue was small. While waiting for LH 1392 in FRA, we were denied access to the LH business lounge because our boarding card showed economy despite presenting the ticket which clearly showed business.  We were travelling with backpacks which fit in the carry on luggage sizing rack at the gate. However, the gate agent would not allow them as carry on items because we had to push them down to get them into the rack. We observed larger suitcases being carried onboard without being challenged. Two of us quickly repacked our packs to the satisfaction of the gate agent. However, the third member of our party was unable to repack as quickly and was threatened with having her ticket cancelled.  While she was eventually able to repack her bag to the satisfaction of the agent, she was quite flustered by the experience. The flight was not full (contradicting claims made by the gate agent) and there were lots of empty seats and luggage bins on board.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-20;"Frankfurt to Bangkok, the boarding was quick since the staff didn´t know how to handle Premium Economy passengers. We were greeted by the cabin staff and found our seat 25A/C. The seat is nice and has a lot of space, like LH old C-Class seat in 1992. There is juice as welcome drink instead of sparkling wine. AVOD screen is big and the choices are much better then on my last flight with LH. The food is the same as in normal Y, but there is not always glass or china, most drinks are served in plastic cups or paper cups for hot drinks.  During flights nobody showed up to offer water or juice. Our lactose free meal ended up in a vegan meal which was inedible. For breakfast we got the same vegan meal again, even complains where not even solved. The seat is nice and very good, but the food and service on this flight was not worth it.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-20;"Lufthansa from Bangkok to Frankfurt on an old Boeing 747-400. Boarding was chaos, since ground staff just opened the doors for boarding. Crew was nice while entering the aircraft. Premium Economy is just behind the business class but no curtain to economy. Only juice was served as welcome drink, instead of sparkling wine like in LH ad. Food was nicer from BKK than from FRA. The seat is absolutely nice and there is a lot of space, I got a decent 4 hour sleep. Crew was there even during flight and offered drinks. Again more plastic and paper cups instead of glass. Food same as economy and the service is no different, because the premium economy has not a separated cabin. It is open to economy after the 4 rows. Nice is the small amenity kit with a toothbrush, paste, eyeshade, earplugs and socks. I would say that the seat is the best shot LH took. They still have to work on the service to provide a truly premium economy. For almost the same price we could have been in business class on a middle east carrier. For us LH premium economy will be a choice for flight to the US, but not for going east or south.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-17;"Flew Lufthansa from Zürich (ZRH) to Bangkok (BKK) via Frankfurt (FRA). We had a chance to try the Jumbo's upper deck (this is the 3 class configuration with premium economy, but without first class, so there are business class seats) and I can only recommend. Really calm and quite up there as not many people moving. The seats are the upgraded business class seats, so they are OK. I must highlight the onboard service which was exceptional in our case. Unfortunately that's not always the case as (like at many other airlines) the service quality really depends on your flight attendant.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-15;"Positives about our Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Denver. Premium economy seats were the same price as economy and offered about 1"" more width, 4"" more leg room and much bigger entertainment screen. Entertainment system was gate to gate. Negatives - We were supposed to board at 12.30 and depart at 13.20. By 13.00 there was no boarding call and no communication from the ground staff at all. Boarding completed about 30 minutes late, we taxied for a while and then the pilot parked and turned off the engines, no communication for 20 minutes to explain what was happening. Waited 3.5 hours on the ground with almost no communication. The crew only came though the cabin two times during the 3.5 hour wait, once with water and once with crackers. Everyone was starving since they had been expecting to get lunch right after take off and was very aggravated by the lack of any service, not even a juice was offered. The kids lunch served (at 6pm) was 5 slices of potato cooked in ketchup with shrimp salad, terrible and neither kid could stomach it. During the flight the crew only came though with water twice on the whole 10 hours. Dinner was either shrimp or mushroom, not something many people would like.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-14;"Birmingham to Budapest via Frankfurt. Pleasantly surprised with Lufthansa for this trip. I had been regretting booking with them following the recent strikes, but thankfully this was resolved a couple of weeks before our trip. Planes clean and tidy, all crew pleasant and a small snack of half a sandwich and one round of drinks served on each flight. Definitely worth the small extra price over the low cost carrier on this route. The only issue for us was the 45 minute transfer in Frankfurt wasn’t enough, we parked remotely and were taken by bus to the terminal which took a surprising amount of time, we then had to clear security again and run to the gate just making the flight. The gate agent was just closing the flight and said she was surprised that we had made it. If this was the case why did Lufthansa book us such a short connection?";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-14;"Luanda to Buenos Aires via Frankfurt. I use Lufthansa quite often and I have never been disappointed. Flights are on time, the attendants are friendly and the meals are very good. The entertainment system is excellent and easy to use. For this flight I used the Senator lounge in Frankfurt for flights to South America and it is superb with direct boarding to the plane. As a Star Alliance Gold Card member, Lufthansa has occasionally upgraded me, so they have my loyalty! I think it is a great airline.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-13;"Recently flew DEN-FRA-BLR with Lufthansa. Overall the trip was good and LH has definitely improved their C class product. The outbound flight was a little bit of a mess. 3 hour ground delay in DEN due to snowstorm and de-icing. I understand these things are out of the control of the airline but given that 95% of the passengers were making connections in FRA they could have done a better job of holding flights/rebooking. Arrived FRA and ran to BLR flight and arrived 5 min before scheduled departure to be told my seat was given away. I was unimpressed given that they knew for hours that connections would not be made and they could have held the flight. Gate agent unhelpful so went to Senator lounge where I was immediately booked to DEL. Lounge staff very helpful. Inflight was impressed with all crews, very attentive particularly on the FRA-India legs (which is not usually the case). Food has improved and inflight entertainment good. 747-8 is a nice aircraft, hopefully they will introduce on the whole network. Ground staff could use some work.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-12;"Chicago to Budapest via Frankfurt. Our flight with Lufthansa from Chicago to Frankfurt was a wonderful experience. I have previously flown on a Lufthansa 747-400, and the 747-8 is a huge improvement! Much quieter, noticeably larger windows, and the economy seats are an improvement. The A319 is nothing special there, but great for an hour and a half flight. Service was great during the flights. The flight attendants were very accommodating for us, as we were flying with children. But, unlike some airlines I’ve flown with (ie. Qatar Airways) the staff didn’t really go out of their way to make it comfortable for the kids. As for meals, I would rate them in the top 3 of airlines I’ve flown with. Also, the IFE was one of the best I’ve experienced, with many options for children’s movies. The staff in the airports were equally as helpful. Overall, a great airline, with professional staff, and nice airplanes.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-10;"Lufhansa has been upgrading its product within the past 2 years. As a loyal customer I appreciate that very much. Even though I have been very satisfied with the service provided on most of my flights within the past few years one has to acknowledge that this last flight was my best flying experience ever. The new Boeing 747-800 is a wondeful aircraft to travel in, new business class is very comfortable and the seats lovely in any position, the inflight entertainement offerd a great variety. but what made the experience superior to any other before was the outstanding crew. Attentive, kind and smiling. Only minor let down is still the quality of the food. It's decent but not great. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-07;"I flew from DUS to SJJ with transfer in MUC with Lufthansa and was very satisfied. Both legs were operated with Airbus A321 which had enough legroom for me (I am taller than 1.90m). There was a small snack on both flights, soft drinks, beer and wine were free and the staff was friendly. Both flights were on time and the transfer in MUC was smooth. Mobile Check-In was easy and fast too.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-07;"Manchester to New York via Frankfurt. First time with Lufthansa and would use again however there are certain things that could do with improvement. The first flight from Manchester on A320 aircraft was overall good on service, punctuality, and ok seating. The seating was uncomfortable and hard. The Boeing 747 was a lovely flight with great crew. Frequent beverages. The food was lovely but dessert was tiny! Inflight entertainment system was the biggest let down and hardly any movies. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-05;"I booked Lufthansa from Bangkok to Nice via Frankfurt return. On my way back, there was a technical glitch with the engine and my flight got delayed by 9 hours. As a result, I missed my connecting flight (With Thai Airways) and was forced to stopover in Bangkok for 10 hours. However, the worst part was the customer service at Frankfurt First Class counter which is where I was directed to, to get further help. It proved to be anything but, helpful. I asked the person at the counter, that due to this delay, now I would not only miss my connections but, also have to stay overnight in Bangkok for 10 hours - how would Lufthansa assist. I was informed that my Contract with Lufthansa ended in Bangkok as my connection was booked separately with Thai Airways and not through Lufthansa.  I had  to go to customer service online or look for Thai Airways staff in Bangkok. When I tried to explain to him that it is basic courtesy that he or someone in Frankfurt office communicates this to their Bangkok office in advance, so I don’t have to go looking for their representative at midnight after a long flight, I was informed this is not possible as they had given me an airport hotel voucher in Frankfurt for the delay and had met their obligation and their contract ended the moment I landed in Bangkok. I re-iterated that all I wanted was that they communicate to their team at the other end, so whatever solution they have can be pre-planned, as it was Lufthansa fault. However, it proved too difficult for the counter person to comprehend, and I had to ask for his supervisor, who seemed to understand and agreed to inform their Bangkok team.  I could not comprehend the service standards and I could not escape the feeling that they were doing me a favor. I understand delays happen, technical glitches happen but, the manner in which you deal with your customers under such circumstances shows the quality of any airline. Lufthansa failed in this case.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-04;I have my first time experience fly with Lufthansa in July. My flight from Jakarta to Innsbruck via Frankfurt and from Budapest back to Jakarta via Frankfurt. The quality and efficiency really impressed me. The crews served the meal and drinks promptly. The entertaintement is better than most airlines that I ever took before. The flight departed on time. Check in was fast and efficient. The only downsize was that the seat was a bit hard.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-12-01;"Dublin to Frankfurt with Lufthansa in Business class. You get a great product and today everything was fine. Fast lane security, access to a nice and quiet Lounge in Dublin, priority boarding, a seat in a calm cabin with two armrests for your own and plenty of space for your elbows. Perfect food and drink servce and priority delivering of the bags. The price is not low-cost, but it is worth the product you get. Weak points? The seats do not really recline, there is no WiFi and there is no inflight entertainment, but as the flight takes only some 100 minutes, it is not a problem for me.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-29;"Hong Kong to London City via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Swift check-in, passport check and security, all very pleasant. We decided on the Thai Royal Orchid lounge as opposed to the United Airlines option. Lounge not too busy, varied choice of food. I had dim sum and spicy soup, sandwiches and a glass of white wine. Sadly there is no champagne in the Thai lounge at HKG nor any choice of wine other than red or white. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the experience and the gate was not too far away. Boarding was orderly, despite the best efforts of some passengers who clearly didn't understand the logistics involved in boarding the A380. We were amongst the first to board and received a warm welcome from the cabin crew and we were addressed by name during the service. Pre-take off drinks were offered including sparkling wine and an amenity kit, slippers and a bottle of water were in the seat pocket. After take off drinks included champagne with a smile and the dinner service was excellent, the scallops and chicken with rice dish was very tasty and the crew were charming. Dinner was rounded off with cheese and port and then coffee and a rather nice Cognac. The seat when fully reclined was comfortable and felt more roomy than the Swiss seat/bed I had on the outbound and I managed to sleep for a few hours undisturbed. The cabin on the A380 was noticeably quiet, maybe because Business class is upstairs. A hearty hot breakfast was served which was tasty and ample. An excellent flight with a stellar crew. Quick disembarkation at FRA and we made our way to the quiet Senator lounge prior to our, not cancelled flight to London City. The flight was very full because many of the mainline flights to Heathrow were cancelled. This short flight was another enjoyable one with a personable crew and a quite filling continental breakfast of cold cuts, cheese, fruit and pastries. The usual bus to the terminal but at least there were the e-gates so not much waiting at immigration and our bags were waiting for us on the carousel. Another excellent Lufthansa experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-28;"This was our first flight with our 4 month old twins, and I had anticipated a lot of stress on this trip, however Lufthansa from check in, during the flight and upon arrival was just great. We enjoyed our trip, as it was an overnight flight the babies sleep for most of the time - and thankfully did not disturb other passengers. The only point is the Baby changer in the bathroom, it is rather difficult (for a man) to change the diapers on the changing table. The service onboard is fantastic - very professional. Also the wine selection - well done - I especially enjoyed the New Zealand wine.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-25;"Check-in at Montreal's airport went smoothly, the ground staff seemed very professional and friendly. Boarding went smoothly as well. Lufthansa recently refurbished it's cabin on all longhaul flights featuring the newer IFE which had a decent choice of everything. The seatpitch was around 31-32 inches but the seat cushion was quite thin. The cabin crew were very friendly as usual for Lufthansa and very professional. The meals that they served on this flight from YUL to FRA were rather standard airline food. We arrived on time in Frankfurt without any problems. I would recommend Lufthansa because they make you feel a bit more special even in economy class.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-25;"Athens to Denver via Munich. I have to say I've never had customer service as good as Lufthansa. I flew international and for my flight home there was a possible strike that would have delayed me days if not a week. I called them in a frantic panic and they calmed me down and rebooked my flight to avoid any stress for me. Later, when I went to fly out there was a problem with my layover not having enough time to get my checked bag through customs and still make my flight. They solved the problem for me and made my travel as smooth as possible! They are wonderful. I would fly with them again because of the support they provided for me during my travels.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-25;"Windhoek to Barcelona via Frankfurt. My first time on Lufthansa Premium Economy, loved the extra space, and must say the Lufthansa meals have improved, the curry dish for dinner was excellent, and the fruit salad served with breakfast was as answer to my prayers - the supply of wine at dinner time and coffee at breakfast is still on the meagre side. Seats comfortable, service great, pity the toilets for economy are at the front of the premium economy cabin, giving a lot of traffic. Also, they seem too few, so queues build up after diner and before breakfast and landing, crowding the cabin and making it busy. After a shower and fast breakfast in the business class lounge in FRA on to BCN, normal economy seat, some coffee and bun - nothing special, dozed. Did not mark the WiFi as I do not carry any devices that need to connect, internet connectivity was advertised on the flight - I just need peace and tranquillity, disconnecting is a plus. A worthwhile offer from LH, my legs/shoulders appreciated it.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-20;Trieste to Dubai via Munich with Lufthansa. Trieste to Munich just an average uneventful regional European flight. Made use of the Senator Lounge at Munich Airport: very clean and calm but small. Munich to Dubai on a spotless A340-600 with the brand new configuration. Good seats and nice entertainment system. Crew in general nice and attentive. Quality of food has improved since last time I flew Lufthansa long-haul but portions remain quite small. Landed in Dubai ahead of schedule. Overall still one of the best airlines in Europe and do recommend. But the quality gap with the Middle East carriers I usually fly is evident.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-20;"Prague to Cologne. Booking my ticket through Germanwings resulted in a lower price (reduction about EUR 90 for a return trip, basic fare without checked luggage/meal). Flight operated by Eurowings CRJ aircraft on the way to Cologne and Germanwings A319 to Prague. Smooth online check-in (open 72 hours before outbound departure. I could choose my seat for both ways free of charge at that point skipping an option to pay for a selected seat at the time of booking). Slim leather seats with limited pitch, however reasonable for a regional short flight. Cabin crew distributed complimentary refreshment to the eligible passengers and offered payable skybar to the others. Both flights arrived on time. Good value for money, cheaper than bus, this category rated by 4 stars as they even reduced the price several hours before departure.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-19;"Mumbai to Frankfurt in Business Class on a Boeing 747-400. Lufthansa has eliminated First Class on this route and now operates this as a two-class configuration.

Service was top notch, and a very comfortable flight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-18;"Singapore to Karlstad via Frankfurt. I booked a Lufthansa business class ticket for my 81 year old mother who recently had a hip replacement operation. I specifically asked for handicap assistance which was confirmed weeks before departure. However, when my mother arrived in Frankfurt for transfer to Singapore, there was nobody to pick her up at the gate so she had to walk all the way to the next gate. For those who have been to Frankfurt airport you know that this can be a considerable distance. Upon her arrival in Singapore I called Lufthansa to file a complaint and was met with the instruction to do this via the website. I did that and got an automatic reply. Since then (now 14 days ago) I have heard nothing from Lufthansa. On her departure from Singapore I was guaranteed that my mother would have access to the business class lounge in Frankfurt on her transfer back to Karlstad as a compensation for their mistake on her outbound journey. (The thing is that there is no business class on the flight from Frankfurt to Karlstad so even though I booked a business class ticket I couldn't get any on that leg). On arrival in Frankfurt she was denied entry to the business class lounge and was put in a wheelchair in a corridor far away from the cafe to wait there for 2.5 hours. Again Lufthansa guarantees were worth nothing! It is outrageous how an elderly person can be treated this way.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-16;"We were supposed to fly Munich to Dubai return on Lufthansa, unfortunately our flight back home was cancelled and we were rebooked to another airline at the airport.

Overall, it was a good experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-11;"My Lufthansa flights were disappointing. Barcelona to Munich on an A321, with dirty interior and my seatback was not adjustable and fixed in the recline position. Staff was friendly but the quality of snack served was poor. Munich to Prague on A319, and stressed flight attendants due to so many huge bags in the aircraft. Why do airlines let people board if they come with oversized luggage that does not fit in the overhead bin or under any seat?  Eventually luggage had to be stowed in a lavatory which was out of order due to this fact - thankfully it was a very short flight of only 45 mins. My return flights were cancelled due to Lufthansa strike.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2015-11-07;"I have traveled using the Lufthansa airlines several times to and from the middle east, US and Canada via Frankfurt or Munich. Cairo to Munich was a great trip, the service, seating, and food was awesome, staff were very nice, and checking on everything throughout the cabin. Munich to JFK was super, staff were excellent, food and beverages like a first class service, the main meal was excellent. Then comes my return flight Toronto to Munich  operated by Air Canada, then things take a different route, the service was slow, and the food was not even a decent meal. I understand this is a different airline, but my problem is I picked Lufthansa and paid their price and chose to go through a layover rather than a direct flight, all this to get the service I chose. I pay to go on Lufthansa I expect to be on a Lufthansa airline or another airline up to their standard of service. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-11-04;"Dallas to Delhi via Frankfurt return with Lufthansa. First international travel with a 22 month old baby and it did not turn up that easy. Crew and service on Lufthansa flights from Dallas till Frankfurt was amazing, but it was the opposite from Frankfurt till Delhi - the cabin service crew was nice but service was limited and slow. The legroom really made my journey difficult from Frankfurt to Delhi. Holding a toddler on the flight is not a good idea because seats are not that wide. My tired toddler made me stand through out the flight. While returning (Delhi-Frankfurt), again service was poor, whereas it was nice from Frankfurt to Dallas. Is this limited service common for south asian flights. Flights are usually full, so there is a little chance to change seats. Air-conditioning in flight can give you a hard time and square cut blankets will not help you, better carry your own 1 light weight blanket and cap/hat and socks. If you are a non-veg then you have some meal options but for veg folks, you will get limited option and they missed my veg meal and I could not settle for sea food.  $1400 flight and this kind of service.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2015-11-01;"FRA-BOM in Business Class in the upper deck on a B747-400. Lufthansa has recently overhauled the Business Class seats in the Boeing 747 and provide true flatbeds. This was a pleasant surprise. The in-flight service was classy. All in all, a very good experience. If there is a quibble, it has to do with FlyNet, Lufthansa's onboard wifi service. It is slow and unreliable.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-29;"I'm a bit hesitant to fly Lufthansa since they have implemented the new Eco-light booking option as it has amounted to the implementation of a new ""junk fee"" for luggage which previously didn't exist on LH. Flight delayed but no announcement was made at the gate. Boarded by bus from a remote location. Seats were  ok from a comfort standpoint, legroom seemed rather cramped. Cabin drink service was efficient. With Lufthansa's services plummenting to that of a discount carrier and their price point being higher than the competition and devalued mileage accrual, I find it hard to justify continued patronage of Lufthansa.";NEGATIVE

We chose Lufthansa both because of price and because of its affiliation with the Star Alliance, allowing us to earn mileage. Most aspects of our travel experience were fine. the check-in process, cabin crew, in-flight entertainment, etc. were as expected. I do have two items to comment on: the selection and quality of the food served, and the discomfort of the headphones. The selection and quality of food was terrible.  Food was inadequately seasoned, no balance between protein, vegetables and starches, and the salad was a joke (a few scraggly strips of lettuce with no veggies at all). The rolls served were ice-cold. Not a pleasant dining experience. The second item was the discomfort in wearing the headphones for the in-flight entertainment. The plastic earpieces were incredibly uncomfortable and the flimsy pads weren't anywhere near sufficient to reduce the discomfort. If we had been on a short flight, I could overlooks these drawbacks, but we were on a 10-11 hr flight, and these things made the overall experience less than ideal. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-26;I recently flew Lufthansa from Los Angeles to Budapest via Munich in Economy Class. I wasn't looking forward to traveling in Economy. I have to say I was impressed (I'm not easily impressed). Decent leg room (I'm 6ft). Two good hot meals with drinks every hour. Excellent IFE system and friendly professional crews both ways. Well done Lufthansa . Will fly LH more in the future.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-26;"Check-in staff failed to enter the correct frequent flyer card. The quality of the food was below anything I have ever experienced. We had to ask for our food as the FA had forgotten us during dinner and breakfast, he was probably the most unfriendly FA I have experienced. The cabin got quite messy after a while. In DUS, in spite of having priority handling, our luggage was among the last ones to arrive. On the plus side, IFE was state of the art and the seats were rather comfy.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-24;"Early morning Lufthansa flight out of Vilnius to Frankfurt was on time, served breakfast and complimentary drinks. Connecting flight to London City landed on time though it was delayed on departure from Frankfurt. Nice sandwiches served, two rounds of complimentary drinks. Cabin crew were really friendly on both legs. In these days of Low-cost Airlines it's nice to fly an airline that actually delivers what passenger experience and service is all about. Definately recommended.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-23;"Budapest to Newark from Budapest via Munich with Lufthansa. Our flight from Budapest to Munich was quick, we were provided a full lunch and flight attendants were efficient in moving through the cabin quick so that trips to the washrooms would be possible for everyone before descent. The flight from Munich to Newark was on one of Lufthansa's A340-600s (my first time on an A340) which I must say are absolutely stellar even compared to the A330 which has pretty much the same cabin. The fact that all economy class washrooms are on the cargo level of the aircraft make it very easy to get to them even if it's the middle of dinner service. The seats were extremely comfortable and the IFE system packed with good content. The flight attendants were professional and went out of their way to make everyone comfortable. Despite taking off from Munich 50 minutes late due to delayed incoming passengers from other flights the pilots did a good job at making up for time and we arrived almost on time in Newark. This was my third time travelling with Lufthansa and they never disappoint.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-21;"Frankfurt to Faro, on a new Lufthansa A321 with the new short haul entertainment system (works on your own mobile / tablet, but you need to download Lufthansa Entertainment App before). Very good seat, professional and friendly service. Good catering. Perfectly on time. No downsides at all.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-20;"Lufthansa from Dusseldorf to Munich. A smooth flight and friendly crew. Seats are more than ok for one hour flight. Quite fascinating was the new On-board Wifi technology, using my own iPhone for IFE.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-19;Flew Lufthansa from Lisbon to Birmingham via Frankfurt and cannot praise Lufthansa enough. Crew were friendly and professional. Food was of a good quality and complimentary alcohol/beverages on short flights was a nice touch. I have flown Lufthansa a few times with in Europe now and they are the best.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-19;"Booked seats in a small section on upper deck which seemed not as crowded as the rest of the plane. Before take-off the flight attendant adressed us by name and checked if the special menus were correct. The vegan food we ordered was some of the best airline food we have had. Flight attendant was friendly and professional. IFE was great, enjoyed some recent movies and liked the vast music selection. Only small negative point: No amenities are provided and Wifi was not for free. Lufthansa product is not as fancy as Turkish Airlines or Emirates but the staff is amazing. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-18;"We booked 2 return seats Manchester to Istanbul via Frankfurt. We booked and paid for extra legroom 12E/F on an A320. This was done using their layout layout of the A320. On arrival at MAN and prior to boarding we noticed that we had been allocated seats 9A/10A. Upon bringing the matter to the attention ground staff we were given seats 12A/B. However, on boarding our connecting flight FRA-IST we noted that seats 12E/12F were not additional leg room. the plane being an A321. The same aeroplane and same problem on journey leg IST-FRA. The final leg FRA-MAN presented the same problem, this time being an A319. Given that we had the correct row number for the first leg of our outward journey, we have no complaints other than the stress caused by the initial seat numbering. Having paid for the additional service we were not given the leg room seats as the only seat plan showing at the time of booking was the A320 configuration. Have you tried getting through to Lufthansa customer service? It's easier to get an audience with the Pope.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-15;"Originally booked in economy but tried to bid for upgrade to Lufthansa premium economy. Got email about unsuccessful bid 24h before flight. Mobile check-in was straightforward, selected preferred seats. During baggage drop-off informed about free upgrade to premium economy which was received with big smile, and even bigger question mark above my head as I was denied pay upgrade? Spent 2 hrs in the business lounge in T1 which follows Lufthansa standard food and catering options. Boarded clean and well maintenanted A340-600, greeted by smiling crew. Premium economy seat is comfortable and spacious, has good recline and very good legroom. Small bottle of water and premium economy amenity kit at seat. IFE screen is large and picture quality is excellent. I like the Lufthansa IFE selection and audio programs are my favorites. As flight is only 7hrs I watched only one movie, but listened to a few music albums. Food is served on tray and I did not see any difference in options compared to economy. Dinner and light breakfast were served during the flight. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient, I felt like a guest, not a passenger. Arrival was with a small delay, connecting flight to Zagreb on clean A319 on time, I slept the whole flight. Miles were credited next day. Due free upgrade overall experience was even higher then expectations and I can strongly recommend Lufthansa's premium economy product for business traveler on a budget.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-14;"I flew Lufthansa from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt in Business Class. The first flight was cancelled while we were taxing due to a problem with an engine switch. The few agents in Buenos Aires had problems dealing with the number of passengers. They weren't able to handle re-booking requests at the airport, but advised to call the call-center in Buenos Aires. Unfortunately, no one picked up at this time of the day. I was only re-booked on the next-day flight after I called Lufthansa in Germany. My seat was 85A on the upper deck which I prefer because you don't have a lot people walking around in the cabin. Two to three flight attendants took care of us on this 14 hour flight. The seat is comfortable and the footsie issue a lot of people complain about wasn't a big deal for me. The cabin layout is quite nice. However, it's difficult to leave your seat if your neighbour turned the seat fully flat and you happen to sit by the window. Then you have to climb over your neighbour. The food was great, however this flight was one of the last ones which didn't offer Lufthansa's new catering service. IFE was good with a large selection of movies. The flight attendants were friendly they always addressed me by name, which was nice. My neighbour was Japanese and one flight attendant spoke to him in fluent Japanese. The amenity kit was okay but other airlines offer a better product. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-14;"Tokyo Haneda to Frankfurt. We traveled as a group of three seated in a small Economy class section between Business and Premium Economy class, which was a quiet and calm area. Crew was good, but not as good as ANA's crew on our first flight. Cabin announcements were too quiet and difficult to understand. Seat is a typical standard economy seat, seat pitch and width were okay. Lufthansa's plus were catering and entertainment. We got two full meals, a snack in the middle of the flight, and a small snack after take-off. All meals were very tasty and sufficient. Lufthansa has also a large selection of drinks including alcoholic beverages. Drinks were also offered by the crew during the flight. Entertainment system was fantastic with a wide selection of movies and music channels. Lufthansa also has one live TV channel, so I had the chance to watch a Premiere League football match, which was a nice touch. I've been flying with Lufthansa for a couple of years now, European and intercontinental flights, and can highly recommend this airline!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-14;"Flew Lufthansa from Los Angeles to Prague via Munich return. I found their service outstanding and attention to detail good. Enjoyed the inflight meals and overall cleanliness of the bathrooms. Flight was well stocked with drinks and they even offered swiss chocolate as part of the flight. Had short hops from Munich to Prague and thought it would be a drop off in service, but found it just as good. On the way back flew the new Airbus and found it even more roomy and accommodating. The ground crew were outstanding in getting us to gate on time when our flight from Prague was delayed a few hours leaving us 45 min to get to the gate in Frankfurt. Would highly recommend this airline and would fly again for any long haul services in future.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-13;"Traveled Lufthansa business class from Munich to Lisbon. MUC airport is always a joy to travel from. The flight was very pleasant. Was seated in the first row of the business cabin with plenty of space. For dinner, a menu was provided with 3 choices for the main to chose from. Food was execllent. The crew was attentive and very kind. This aircraft offered the European inflight entertainement system which passengers can receive through the LH app on mobile devices, very nice touch. I have been a Senator for over 10 years and will fly LH again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-13;Lufthansa business class from Frankfurt to Hong Kong in a new Boeing 747-8. Selected seat in main cabin on lower deck as it feels much more spacious than the upper deck. Seat was a center aisle seat with plenty of space between the two seats. Seating and lounge position was very comfortable. Screen is nice and entertainement had plenty of options to choose from. Only minus in my opinion is the lack of stowage and the rather small seat width around the shoulders when fully reclined. The issue with the feet being close to the neighbour didn't really disturb me. Food was good but not excellent. Crew was great. Had about 7 hours of sleep and arrived well rested.  Best European airline for me with very consistent service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-12;"My husband and I occupied Seats 45H and 45G on this flight. We are both seniors. Our row was directly behind row 44, which is the bulkhead row. Sitting there, I expect that there may be a baby or two seated in front of us, but not five (5) as was the case on this flight. As the plane attained altitude the woman in front of us changed her baby's diaper in the seat. The staff softly mentioned to her that changing should be done in the restrooms, and then proceeded to reward her behavior with a multitude of gifts for her two children. The children acted out, screaming and yelling, setting off the other children in the row during the entire flight. They were continually rewarded with extra attention from the flight attendants, while we struggled to get their attention for basic service. Surely five is too many young children too be in one row, making the flight a miserable experience for everyone seated around them. Lufthansa needs to disperse the children on any flight, so they don't constitute a critical mass of misery for all the paying passengers around them. At the very least, all other passengers should get their fair share of attention from the flight staff. This arrangement demonstrated very poor judgement on Lufthansa's part.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-10;"Athens to Seattle via Frankfurt. Excellent service, on time departure, pretty good food, enough leg room to get by. After flying Air Canada Rouge the difference on Lufthansa was very obvious. This airline makes it look easy and appears they know that we the flying people are the customers and they know how to treat us, especially on a transatlantic flight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-09;"Toronto to Frankfurt, and this flight was operated on one of Lufthansa's older Boeing 747 aircraft, with smaller individual screens. Slight delay of over thirty minutes, partly due to flight attendants having to find new seats for a young family for unknown reasons. Meal service consisted of dinner and breakfast, but taste was not as good as on flights originating from Frankfurt. Announcement was made about free WIFI onboard, but I wasn't able to connect throughout the flight. Cabin attendants were pleasant and helpful.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-08;"I loved the Lufthansa service on the flight from Frankfurt to Chicago O'Hare. Pilots were very helpful with information. Translators were very efficient. Cabin crew service was exceptional. However, Lufthansa staff at Frankfurt were not helpful. They changed my terminal of departure and I struggled moving from one terminal to the next. The security guards and airport officials could not speak good English. I figured it anyway, and nearly missed my flight.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-07;"Dusseldorf to Jakarta via Frankfurt. Thanks to my Star Alliance Gold membership I was able to use the first class check in, which was very nice. Staff really friendly and helpful. In contrast to that however, was the receptionist at the lounge. She was grumpy and unfriendly. The lounge was rather crowded. Food selection was OK and there was a rather vast selection of beverages available which was nice. DUS to FRA is too short for any kind of service for economy class. The hardware is the Lufthansa hardware for short haul flights. Nice and comfy for short flights. Transfer in Frankfurt was unpleasant due to the long walking distance. I went directly to the gate where the boarding procedures were comencing shortly after. I was able to use priority but the procedure seemed very smooth. Shortly after take off menus were distributed, however, only to some of the economy class passenger. Also, there was no choice between food options later on. I know some passenger had a different menu. Crackers and drinks were served. I ordered water and tomato juice, but my juice was forgotten and I was left with only salt and pepper until I had to remind the FA. Approxmately 3hrs after take off dinner was served.  Food was tasty, and the portion itself was comparable to other economy classes. The seat comfort was better than I had expected. The seats recline nicely and there is a decent amount of legroom available. When I wasn't enjoying the new very good entertainment system I was able to catch some good sleep. During flight, the FA served water and juice and there was a self service bar for drinks and crackers in the galley. Shortly before arriving for a technical stop in Kuala Lumpur breakfast was served. Containing of scrambled eggs and potaoes along with the usual items. Most of the passengers left in Kuala Lumpur and the airplane was pretty empty when we were heading to Jakarta. A nice and fresh sandwich and drinks were served on this short trip. Overall I would say a good experience. Not the top level five star experience you get from some carriers, but quite OK. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-06;"Hadn't flown Lufthansa since I defected from Star Alliance more than ten years ago.  On these two sectors, I was impressed. New Boeing 747-8, very comfortable business class seating, smiling and efficient flight attendants and well above standard food and wine. Lufthansa have come a long way in ten years and if this is their new standard, I may consider returning to Star Alliance. Only downside was the transit in Frankfurt where we had to disembark at a remote stand and then had to navigate the complex chicane of border control and security.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-06;"Beijing to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The A380 is extremely quiet and with Bose noise cancelling headphones it is even better, the quietest flight I have experienced so far. The seat was very comfortable and a good movie selection on a large screen. Good menu (a bit on the meaty side because of the Oktoberfest menu) and friendly cabin crew. Highly recommended. We left Beijing 30 mins late and arrived Frankfurt about 20 mins late. Nonetheless we did not miss our short connection to London City because ground staff brought us to the airplane by bus. A very good service indeed.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-05;"Lufthansa continuously provides a very good European Business product. Check in was very efficient with instructions to use Fast Track security so that the way from arrival at the airport to the lounge was not longer than 5 minutes. Priority boarding was strictly enforced and passengers were welcomed by pilot and purser. Lunch was of very good quality and the crew was very attentive. All necessary information was given after arrival in Frankfurt and the explanation why a Schengen aircraft arrived closely to gates ""C"" (non-Schengen) was given. Bus transfer to the Schengen terminal was fast.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-05;"Montpellier to Cluj-Napoca via Munich with Lufthansa. The first leg was cancelled due to bad weather at the departure airport. We waited more than 4 hours in the airport without food or water from the airlines and then transferred to Marseille airport by bus. In Marseille, we were acommodated at the airport hotel, 2 in a room even though we did not know each other. A hot meal was available at the hotel but was not ready to be served when we arrived. After a night in Marseille, the following day we were put onto the flight to our final destination. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-04;"We flew Lufthansa from Manchester to JFK via Frankfurt, returning Washington to Manchester via Frankfurt.  A321 and A320 on short hauls, and on the US a Boeing 747-88. Solid performance both ways with the US flights being on schedule. Aircraft were clean and tidy, IFE good but not exceptional, touch screens responsive enough and a adequate range of content. The slim line seats are okay for if you stretch a bit. Our seat choices were honoured as well. Food was edible but bland. What impressed me was how Lufthansa dealt with a delay issue (not LH fault) by proactively booking passengers through on alternates while we were still airborne to FRA. What didn't impress me was the lack of enforcement of cabin baggage rules on the US-EU sector, if you werent on the plane in the first 10 minutes of boarding, you had nowhere to put luggage due to all the maximum sized carry ons already occupying the overheads. The European flights had nice sandwiches and seemed more roomy - with more restraint in overhead usage space.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-04;"Lufthansa flight from Chicago to Frankfurt was pretty good. It was definitely way better and more comfortable than the one I took with Lufthansa one year ago. They were the kindest cabin crew, they smiled a lot, but not with fake smile. When I was forgotten during beverage service once, I was apologized many times for that. Food was served twice (full meal and snack) and beverages few times, probably 3 or 4. I was seated at the beggining of my part of aircraft, middle corridor, so no seat was in front of me, although it didn't mean more space for legs. Plane wasn't full, which means that journey was way more comfortable. Many passangers had 2 seats for themselves, some had more. Only one thing that I didn't like was comfort of the seat. It was too thin. More up-to-date films would be appreciated if they really want to be 5-star airline (and their crew behaviour suggests so).";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-04;"Hamburg to Frankfurt, very friendly Lufthansa staff at check-in in Hamburg. There was bad weather in Frankfurt, and as we were early at the airport they booked us on an earlier flight in order to prevent us from missing our connecting flight. Found that very attentive! Plane was  very clean. We were served a small bag of tasty crisps, no more food was served due to bad weather. Cabin crew and captain apologized nicely. Good and punctual flight with LH.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-10-03;"I flew Frankfurt to Buenos Aires in Lufthansa First Class at the end of August 2015. Before the flight, I visited the First Class Terminal. Having been there a few years before, it's amazing how Lufthansa keeps the service at such a high level. When the plane was ready to board, I was driven to the 747-8 with a Porsche Cayenne. First Class has eight seats, however, on this flight it was only one other passenger and myself. From the moment I boarded the plane, two flight attendants looked after us for the next 14 hours. The seat has to be the most comfortable on any plane these days. I sat on 2A, which is my favourite. Lufthansa did a really amazing job. The amenity kit might not be as luxurious as on other carriers, but it was good for me. They gave me a Pyjama from van Laack in which I could sleep. The food was superb and I was served several starters. One of the flight attendants offered to prepare another main dish if I didn't like the course I ordered. It was followed by desserts and pralines. The service was very kind and attentive without being intrusive.  IFE was great and had a fairly large selection of movies, tv shows, music and other things. When I was ready to sleep, the flight attendant made the bed on the seat behind me (3A). The bedding was almost as good as a regular one from home. They also put something like a mattress on the seat to make it more comfortable. I asked to be woken up two hours before landing in Buenos Aires and so I was.  On this flight, the purser came around three times to check on me and the other passenger. On arrival in Buenos Aires we were greeted by a representative who explained us how the immigration process works and told us that our luggage would be delivered to a dedicated luggage belt. I highly recommend Lufthansa First Class. It's not cheap, but it's a top-notch product.";POSITIVE

There was no dedicated PE check-in counter or priority boarding offer ex-SFO. Food and drink were the same as economy.  The hot towel offered before meals is like a wet tissue. ;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-29;"I flew Lufthansa from Johannesburg to Frankfurt and then onto Vienna. I will just review the long-haul flight in this case. Johannesburg OR Tambo international terminal is fairly clean and modern and has a free, quick WIFI service with 30 minutes complimentary browsing time. The flight was very impressive with the new business class onboard the upper deck of the A380. Lufthansa now has a restaurant service onboard long haul flights so you order your food and favorite drink before departure. The food was fantastic and crew very attentive and friendly. My only critic is in regards to the inflight entertainment, which has a fairly limited selection in comparison to certain Asian airlines.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-28;"Munich to San Francisco with Lufthansa, and we have flown it before.  I enjoyed almost everything on this flight. The entertainment was top notch with tons of movies, television shows, documentaries, you name it. The inflight service could have been better, often thirsty and having to walk to the galley to get water. The food was okay. We were served lasagna which tasted sweet, not to my liking. The seats were comfortable. There was a lot more legroom on this flight than the flight there (an A380 where seats were crammed together). However on this A340 I felt there was more room. I would fly this flight again with Lufthansa.";POSITIVE

This was my first time long haul on Lufthansa for over 5 years, and what a fantastic surprise. The seats and cabin were clean, comfortable bed and nice duvet etc and amenities. Food service was so good, and the best I have experienced since flying Qatar Airways in June this year. Nicely presented and food of a very good taste. Cabin staff were the highlight and biggest change since my last time on Lufthansa - they were genuinely keen and happy to serve, great interaction with customers. The IFE was good for some short night time viewing, didn't test the wifi on this trip. Most of my trips are out of London and I prefer directs, but would seriously choose Lufthansa over British Airways if they can offer good schedules.";POSITIVE

The Boeing 747-8 is a joy to fly from Frankfurt to Tokyo Haneda, with a very professional and willing crew and great food. The new flat bed seat was comfortable over the 11 hrs journey. The European A321 Business class seat is at best hard and at premium economy level.  Gate discipline by staff at Frankfurt was non existent. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-26;"I recently flew Lufthansa from Prague to Malta via Frankfurt, return. On both directions I changed planes in Frankfurt. The service on board was adequate for the duration. The Frankfurt to Malta portion is a little over 2 hours. For the first time in a long time the flight attendants were smiling and seemed to like what they are doing. On each flight we were served a sandwich, which was pretty good and free drinks, including alcoholic beverages. Lufthansa needs to work on is their in-flight entertainment. No entertainment options. Usually their in-flight magazine contains some interesting articles, but not this time.  The planes were clean, in good shape and the legroom is good compared to other economy classes. Be prepared to walk at lot at Frankfurt airport, especially if you need to switch from area B to area A. Although in the same terminal it takes easily 15-20 minutes. If the price is right I suggest to try it for yourself. Just be careful as Lufthansa introduces more and more hidden fees depending on your fare.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-24;"London Heathrow to Frankfurt day return trip. The Lufthansa lounge at Terminal 2 Heathrow is spacious, but gets busy during early morning peak travel times. With Senator card able to use that section of the lounge - which was clean and nicely presented, good choice of newspapers and magazines. Food here is provided by Do&Co which I tends to equate to a great quality. Freshly baked croissants at 05.10am on a Monday morning is nice to find. Onboard it was the standard Lufthansa short haul business cabin, with middle seat left empty. Breakfast was a cold plate choice and warm rolls offered, all of good standard. Newspapers and magazines also supplied in this cabin. Good info from cockpit and staff service was efficient. Return trip did not have time to use Lufthansa lounge at Frankfurt - boarding by bus to a very remote stand. Late lunch cold cut tray offered, drinks and coffee, but service was not so good. The cabin staff meant to be serving in business class quickly disappeared to help in Economy cabin and not seen for the rest of the flight.";POSITIVE

Afterwards they resumed with the service and apologized for the interruption! ";POSITIVE

Flight crews were professional, friendly and highly efficient. On all flights the captain or co-pilot was standing at the front and welcoming the passengers. On A321 flights you can use boardconnect, the wireless IFE on your iphone or laptop, wonderful feature where you can download all kind of magazines and newspapers, watch movies and see the flight route for free. Wifi is announced for 2016 on intraeuropean services. On all flights (even the short hop Frankfurt-Bremen 35 min) full bar service including wines and a snack like sandwich or crackers. Munich is a great airport to transfer within minutes. Highly organized, Lufthansa offers all passangers free hot beverages at the gates and free newspapers. Frankfurt the ways can be quite long, depends on where you land and depart. But fine too. All in all besides its subsidiary Swiss the best way to travel within Europe.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-20;"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansa’s new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansa’s ambition is to become Europe’s first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care – and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I’ve had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (‘lie-flat’) seats have been described by others. Since I’ve been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these ‘new’ seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow – perhaps too narrow for comfort – and I don’t really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn’t close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I’ve noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world’s biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But it’s a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-19;"Sao Paulo to Hannover via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Excellent flights with professional and charming flight attendants on both flights. From São Paulo to Frankfurt on brand-new jumbo jet with new business seats. Very good seat comfort and enough space, quite ample inflight entertainment, tasty and high-quality food. The flight attendants make the real difference, and are really top notch! Very attentive, friendly and responsive. I like the lounge music channel no. 8! Fast wifi on board. Business lounge in Frankfurt is also very good with good buffet and shower facilities. And on the 30 minutes flight to Hannover the service was impressive, a full meal was served (see photo). Only the seat comfort on intra European flights could be better. But they stream you the inflight entertainment on your tablet or phone, a great extra. In total, Lufthansa has improved significantly its service and product and it's a pleasure to fly with this airline!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-15;"Dallas Ft Worth to Düsseldorf via New York JFK with Lufthansa. Super nice staff, plane was full but easy to board. Plane left on time food came out quick and was hot, I took the chicken teriyaki. Drinks were many, I had 2 glasses of wine and 2 shots of cognac, and woke up in Frankfurt. Staff was great and plane was clean, all the IFE worked and seats with power outlets.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-15;"Lufthansa was kind of special for me on my trip from Vienna to Milan via Munich. I have never had to catch a connection flight and even though I was a bit worried, I knew it would be okay and it was. The cabin staff were helpful and kind, and I can't complain about anything. This was the first time me flying with Lufthansa, but I hope, not the last one!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-14;"I flew Lufthansa from Munich to Istanbul on Thursday, 10 September. Fortunately, I missed the LH pilots' strike by one day. As a Star Gold, I used the business class check-in, which was friendly and efficient. Boarding was punctual and disciplined, but we all ended up on the same bus. Onboard, I had a window seat in a row to myself. Breakfast service was prompt. The meal was tasty and LH offers sparkling wine even in economy. We departed and arrived on-time, and luggage was waiting when we cleared immigration. The most impressive feature of the flight was the onboard entertainment streamed to the passenger's own ipad. The live route map can be enlarged to a point where you see the airplane actually moving over detailed terrain. I am looking forward to my return flight on Tuesday.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-12;"London to Mexico via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. Checked in online. Arrived at the airport with half hour to spare, worried about unable to check my baggage but staff really went out of their to accommodate. Flight to FRA delayed by 45 minutes due to no show pax, barely made the connecting flight. Seated on the A380 upper deck for the flight to Mexico, and it was very spacious and the seat was comfortable - although a bit narrow. The seat next to me was empty otherwise not sure if I would particulary like the design of the foot divider. Notice there was no divider to separate myself and the pax next to me which isn't ideal. Food was ok, nothing special. Good IFE selection. Overall a good product but something should be done about adding more privacy between pax and separate out the foot divider as LH have done on the A340-600 series.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-09;"Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Boston in Premium Economy. Great seat with lots of space, and great IFE with lots of films and large touchscreen monitor. Very friendly cabin crew, drinks available throughout the flight  Pre-made off cocktail (non-alcoholic though). The food is the same as in Economy.  Additional lower leg support would make the seat even better. Overall a good experience with only minor complaints. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-08;"I was upgraded to premium economy at the gate on my Lufthansa flight from Johannesburg to Frankfurt. I was surprised at how much better premium economy is to economy, so much more space, smooth and fluid entertainment system, great service throughout the whole flight. Friendly and attentive crew. Great food and drinks. Seats are very comfy and plenty of space to put all your stuff like phones, iPods, wallets, headphone, etc. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-07;"My latest Lufthansa experience was quite underwhelming. The catering has become meager (a small package with biscuits and one drink). The flight back was almost one hour late. The Boeing 737 on the flight back looked slightly tired, uncomfortable and worn seats and had not been cleaned properly before the flight (my tray was full of sticky spots and crumbs, cabin wall also had beverage splashes on it). In Frankfurt and Bologna we had parking positions away from the terminal which meant bus transfers - in Frankfurt they were quite long,  plus 15 minute taxiing from the runway to our parking position. While the announcements in German were good, those in English were shorter, spoken in a hurried way and not very easy to understand.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-07;"Brussels to Munich with Lufthansa. The flight departed and arrived on time. Seat was much better than on the first leg. Overall no issues, and would fly Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-06;"Athens to Montreal via Munich with Lufthansa in September, and was very impressed with the service. Equipment was like new, comfortable leg room in economy, good entertainment choices, good meals including complimentary wine/alcohol and constant refills of water or juice. Staff professional and very friendly. Would only advise that customs control for connecting flights could be more efficient at Munich Airport. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-03;"Lufthansa return Hong Kong to Munich in Premium Economy. Onboard, the seats were quite narrow and smaller in comparison to Cathay and not very comfortable. There is no proper divider between economy and premium economy and no separate toilet. The return from Munich it was raining heavily, and we had to take a shuttle bus to the plane. When we arrived at the plane, everybody just ran for it. No staff there with umbrellas or to coordinate. Given how strict Lufthansa are eg. With luggage weight, the number of pieces of luggage etc, you would think they had better coordination in bad weather. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-02;"Lufthansa Premium Economy is a great thing if you cannot afford Business Class and Economy class is not enough. It's a very good product and is more than just more space. It's better service, nicer food, more baggage and a bigger inflight entertainment screen.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-02;"Boarding was efficient and friendly. There was a delay in departure of almost an hour due to an airport operational issue but we were kept well informed by the captain and well attended to by the cabin crew. I chose sleep over dinner which was served shortly after take off, but the menu offered a good and varied choice. The A380 is wonderfully quiet and the flat bed seats are comfortable so I was able to sleep soundly for most of the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic and a credit to Lufthansa. I did not use the IFE on this flight. Breakfast was delicious, offering a selection of hot and cold dishes as well as very good coffee, with plenty of time to enjoy the meal before preparation for landing. Will be opting for Lufthansa on this route in future - a great flying experience!";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-09-01;"In a word, brilliant. Typically German but I like that. Efficient and to the point. Aircraft was really clean both inside and out. IFE is by far the best. Excellent choice of films and music. The moving map is by far the best I've seen with 3D visualisations of the aircraft and virtual views from the cockpit and over the wings. Food was good. Service was friendly and regular refreshments. Only gripe was leg room seemed a bit tight. Highly recommended.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-31;Munich to San Francisco in Business Class. Great service with very friendly staff. Captain welcomed us onboard both flights. Food and the new business class seat were fantastic!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-31;"Yesterday, was the 7th flight we have taken on this airline. Very good. In the past we have flown from Manchester to Frankfurt, then on to Bangkok. We went on a Cruise to Mumbai, then flew from there to Manchester via Frankfurt. In addition on 23rd August we flew from Manchester to Budapest via Frankfurt. Yesterday it was Munich to Manchester in a full if rather small plane. I do like the staff on Lufthansa, they are efficient and friendly. The seats in Economy have a reasonable amount of legroom for a 6 footer. The food is normally quite reasonable although I am not a fan of airline food as I sometimes believe they are trying to kill us.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-30;"I was flying Lufthansa CityLine with my wife and son to Munich for a holiday. The aircraft was clean, seats comfortable and cabin crew was nice, but during flight back to Warsaw the meal was a piece of cake, despite the fact that it was about 12:30.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-08-27;"Good service, smooth check-in, I got a chocolate stick when I boarded the plane. Seat is comfortable, cabin crews are friendly and attentive. Just 1 hour flight, cold and hot drink was offered during the flight. But the price is a bit expensive, it cost me AU$300 on this 1 hour domestic flight. ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-26;"A very efficient check-in was followed by a chaotic boarding process, with passengers drifting unbidden through the departure gates only to be stopped at a checkpoint at the airbridge. The onboard seating had plenty of legroom for a short flight, but was rather narrow. A small pack of biscuits and a drink were offered by the hard-working and friendly crew. Transit at Frankfurt involved bus transfers at each end and wading through the very crowded terminal. We made it but our luggage didn't. The onward flight was similar to the first, with a tasty sandwich and a drink offered. Both flights operated roughly on time, despite the second cabin crew having to spend a lot of time helping some passengers to store grossly oversized items of hand luggage. Our cases were delivered to the hotel six hours after arrival.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-26;"My mother in law passed away and I needed to get a flight for my husband immediately. I called several airlines and only found two that offered special bereavement tickets. One was Delta and the other Luftansa. Out of these two Luftansa had the best rate. I was very disappointed that the other airlines couldn't care less about their customers. The only important thing was their bottom line. I purchased two tickets and saved $2000 on Luftansa. Thank you so much for making this difficult time a little easier. In the future, I will try to give my business to Lufthansa and Delta.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-25;"Business Class on Lufthansa is amazing, and cabin service among the best I have experienced. The food is good, wine is good and the entertainment also very good. The only thing I would note about the bed is that there is less room for your feet compared to some other flat beds, but is otherwise very comfortable.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-24;"Flew from Athens to Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The meal was not the best, yet tasty and enough in quantity. As the flight were on about 6am, we were served breakfast - an omelet with baked vegetables, a small piece of bread, some jam, butter and the drink of our choice. Most of the cabin crew members spoke Greek fluently, which was of great assistance to the non-English/German speakers on board. However, the service was not good for my standards as I spotted rudeness coming from several flight attendants. One would expect much better by one of the biggest airlines worldwide but I had a good overall experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-23;"Just a short flight across to LHR to then go on to Auckland. The check-in lady seemed a bit unfriendly to start with but credit to her and her supervisor for doing their best to check our bags all the way through (the system didn't allow it in the end). Compared to other European airlines you don't get much for food - just a slice of cake and a drink, but for a short flight this isn't a major issue for me. The flight left close to on time (someone checked their baggage in but didn't turn up so this held us up a bit) and the actual flight was very comfortable. Did the job required - no complaints.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-22;"Lufthansa has been my favorite airline for many years. We departed from Chicago O'Hare with a slight delay, but it was caused by bad weather conditions and airport traffic. After that, the takeoff and flight, as well as landing, were pleasant and smooth. There was enough legroom even in economy class and the flight crew were very professional. The onboard entertainment system was really good - many new movies, tv series. The only problem for me was food, because it was really awful, especially in comparison to my previous flight from Frankfurt to Chicago O'Hare, where the food was quite tasty. Otherwise flying with Lufthansa has always been a pleasure and I'm looking forward for my next flight with them.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-21;"My first time flying with Lufthansa turned out to be very satisfying. The seats and IFE screens on the plane were new which offered a modern design and very responsive IFE. The movie and music selections were good, and the moving-maps offered a detailed position of the aircraft. The seats were quite comfortable and a meal was served even though the flight was scheduled past midnight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-21;"Everything went well and flights were all on time. On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants  were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic. I must also say pay for the seat selection. It's worth it if the flight is oversold. I recommend Lufthansa for travel to Germany and beyond.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-17;"MAN-MUC. Flight departed on time. Free drinks and light breakfast. Crew professional. New recaro seats not ideal, but allow extra leg room. No jetway available at MUC, passengers bussed to the terminal. Had an hour to connect in Munich, and was worried that checked bags wouldn't make the connection. MUC-MAD again departed on time, drinks and pasta lunch. Crew again professional. Flight arrived in Madrid 15 minutes early. Had to wait to be off loaded since at non jetway stand. Waited 20 minutes at the baggage reclaim and my bag arrived in the first batch. Lufthansa- professional, competitive and have a decent economy product. Would definitely recommend.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-16;"I flew with Lufthansa from Delhi to Vancouver via Munich. Both of the airplanes were A330-300. Delhi To Munich the cabin wad clean, Crew was really nice and constantly asking passengers if they needed anything. I was really lucky that I had a window seat and no one was sitting besides me the entire flight so I could easily put my legs on the side seats when I wanted to sleep. Food was okayish not that outstanding. In flight entertainment was really good as there were varieties of things to choose from and touch screen was also very responsive. Overall it was a good flight. Munich to Vancouver we had to board via a bus. As soon as I got into the plane the plane was full. Not even a single sear was empty so I knew this time I couldn't be lucky to not get a seat just for myself. Ended up sitting on a window seat with a decent man beside me. As soon as I turned on the flight entertainment I was disappointed. The touch wasn't responsive at all like it was on my previous flight. You just to push really hard to click on something and let it play. Content was same as of the previous flight. Overall the experience was okayish. What else can you expect from an economy class.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-16;"Very comfortable cabin, though not a dedicated business cabin (Y-class seats, middle seat free). Staff was extremely friendly and courteous, meal service on both short legs was exceptional quality. priority luggage arrived early on arrival. Only Frankfurt airport is sort of a let-down - dingy, crowded, long walks through rather untidy corridors. a nice touch by Lufthansa is that at the gates they offer free daily newspapers and free coffee, tea, cocoa as well as water on self-serve basis.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-13;Was a pleasure fly from LAX to MUC and eventually to FCO with Lufthansa. Great crew and pilots. All flights were on time and there weren't any delays at any point in my journey.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-12;"Lufthansa has a comfortable business lounge at Washington Dulles International airport offering an enjoyable selection of cold and hot dishes and drinks. You can board the plane directly from the lounge. No need for queuing. In the rear of the B747-8 some economy class seats in rows B and I have extra space since there are no A and K seats. The food was served relatively fast after takeoff in order to give you as much time for sleeping as necessary. The cabin crew were very attentive, ensuring that passengers do not recline back during dinner and breakfast and giving you a second helping for wine and soft drinks. New economy seats are comfortable and offer sufficient space to sleep well. Inflight entertainment still has the best selection of classical and jazz music of any airline I know.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-11;"We were told at checkin that out 5 and 6 year old children would be in separate seats across the plane as there were insufficient adjoining seats. Traveling with young children is stressful for any family, but traveling next to unrelated unsupervised kids is surely most people's idea of hell. After 45 mins of arguing we finally managed to secure two pairs of seats in different sections of the plane, sandwiched between strangers. I know it is the modern way to extract every dollar out of the customer through random taxes and numerous surcharges, but it doesn't make any sense to scatter family members throughout the plane.  Maybe Lufthansa should automatically allocate seats for families with young children or be transparent and honest about hidden costs of securing seats. I'm not sure the current policy is very customer inspired for the family traveller or the individual that could be sittings next to an unsupervised, emotional and tired young child. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-10;"Lufthansa's first class product is truly world class. Flying in seat 1A on the 747-8i from Frankfurt to New York was like sitting in a decked out BMW. Everything in the cabin exuded luxury and precise German engineering. The leather of the seat and the console. The seat movements were effortless. The table slid in and out from the side console without any resistance. It is a quality product. Even the details in the bathroom made it a pleasure to hang out there. Although the cabin has a very open feel, unlike the very private suites on Singapore Airlines or Emirates, there is a side panel that you can lift that creates enough privacy if you so desire it. The catering was superb, as was the service. European professionalism with class. Add to that the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and the drop-off to the plane in a white Porsche, and you get a Top 3 global first class product. If I had to change one thing, it would be the video screen. It’s far too small for a product like this. It doesn’t do justice to the rest of the cabin. My only question now is: why can't LH make their business class as superb in comparison to other airlines?";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-09;"The flight from Bologna landed late. Nobody was waiting for us and we had to run from one side of the airport to the other, and Frankfurt airport is a huge airport. When I arrived all passengers had already boarded. Then in Chicago I got another surprise - my luggage did not make it on the plane. I went to the Lufthansa booth to fill the form and they told me the suitcase would arrive on the next day flight and I should expect it for around 5pm (it arrived at midnight). They gave me a bag with toothpaste, toothbrush, a deodorant and some other items. The onboard service was good. Food was good. The cabin was nice with new furniture. WI-FI didn't connect.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-09;"Food on return trip was marginally better than on outward trip but nothing to write home about, especially the overly tired pain chocolat on the way out which I tried to bite but then thought better about it. Staff are friendly and attentive. Seats were comfortable, and needed to be so, as Lufthansa seem to have a unique way of putting a plane down quite hard onto the runway. My only criticism is with the lack of organisation at the check-in gates, with flights sometimes not being called properly so that passengers mill around not knowing what is going on. This aspect is even worse when things go wrong, as they often do on the trip to and from Salzburg as a result of delays and cancellations due to adverse weather. There is very little signage or help from Lufhansa staff in such circumstances.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-06;"I am a frequent traveller. Based on this experience I would not recommend Lufthansa for economy class long-haul. The space between seats was very cramped (worst I've had on long-haul). This was for an 11 hour flight. Quality of food was poor, essentially inedible. On positive side, staff were friendly, flight was punctual, entertainment system was good.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-08-01;"For the first time I flew Lufthansa from Rome to Sao Paulo via Frankfurt, I was very impressed with the meal service and with the cabin crews. The service was great and the seats were very comfortable, especially on the brand new 747-800. The only negative point is the inattentive and rude ground staff at Fiumicino airport. Overall I would recommend Lufthansa on this route. The business class service is excellent, almost on par with that offered by Swiss.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-31;"Traveled from Stockholm to Munich in the originally booked slimline Economy seat, which surprisingly felt more roomy at a 30-inch pitch than the 31-to-33-inch Air Canada E190 Economy seat I sat in three days later. Complimentary sandwiches and beverages served en route. Effortless connection to onward flight to Canada on arrival in Munich. Received an unexpected upgrade to Business Class, which was a wonderful experience with more personalized service, good food, a decent selection of documentaries to watch (which I prefer to movies), and a comfortable recliner seat.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-30;"For the first time I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to Dubai, I was very impressed with the meal service and with the cabin crew. Service was great, every 20-30 minutes water and juice was served. The seat comfort was good. Overall a good experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-30;"The flight attendants were surly, service poor and the seating uncomfortable. The 747 had the new slim seats and the passenger in front of me had his seatback reclined the entire flight. The movie screen was so close to my face. The beverages were passed out in very small plastic glasses and rarely more than half full. One has to ask for 2-3 cups to get a healthy amount of fluids. The flight attendents hid behind the curtains much of the flight, discouraging passengers from walking in the aisles. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-30;"This is a very quick flight onboard the small A319-100. The seats are the usual economy seats with the middle seat empty. However, what I’m always amazed with Lufthansa is how even on a 55 min flight they can provide you with a delicious, fresh and well presented meal. On such short flights, where seats on various European airlines are often very similar, it’s a memorable meal like this that can make all the difference.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-30;"Smooth check-in in KIX. Acceptable ANA lounge. Not a friendly welcome on board. Seat 1A is the best, with a lot of room, much wider. Service was extremely friendly, especially from the Japanese attendant who was completely dedicated to customers. Unfortunately western food was horrible, it seemed old, no taste - crew did not accept that I switch to Japanese menu. Wine list as poor as on the way to KIX. Catering was below international standards in Asia. Connection in FRA was quick (arr and dep in Term B). however no lounge on the Schengen part of Term B. A trap. Bus to aircraft. Nice welcome, nice snack, very friendly service.";NEGATIVE

Lufthansa could not help that at Rome Airport the lounges were closed, however a voucher of 10€ was rather limited - for a small snack and 2 basic non alcoholic drinks I paid 17 €. Flight delayed on departure due to extremely strong winds at Frankfurt airport. Once boarded FA's were friendly - meal was rather basic for this flight, drinks just OK. Frankfurt to Brussels flight had a delay of nearly one hour due to stormy winds. When seated for 20 minutes onboard, drinks were provided to all passengers. Captain did give ample information - meal ok, luggage could have been faster at Brussels airport.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-27;"LH145 - 06/07/2015, A319. Easy boarding Process in Nuremberg, friendly staff on board. After arriving in Frankfurt, due to short connection, direct transfer with a limousine was already organized. LH440 - 06/07/2015, A380. Unfortunately when arriving at the gate to Houston, plane was delayed due to technical issues. Ground staff were confused, delayed the boarding twice. Boarding started about 45 min later than normal. Due to the amount of seats in business class, there were already 2 lines of about 40 people each for the boarding process. When boarding started the ground staff did that manually in only one line, without activating the two self service scanners. After 20 min I went to the purser and asked if she can assist me with boarding (First/Sen). She told me the boarding process had already started (sure, I was waiting there) and I can board after queuing in the line. After I asked why the scanners were not activated, she looked confused around and asked some colleagues, who then activated the scanners, which gave me the possibility to board. Unfortunately already a lot of people from Economy had boarded, which caused a delay on the stairs to the two bridges (First/Business and Economy). Overall my worst boarding process flying First with LH. Welcome on board was great, service and food thru the entire flight the same. Great people and a big thank you to the team of LH. The pilot could not catch up, so when we landed in Houston and the door opened, I had 10 minutes connection time to the boarding to TPA on C34. Fortunately it worked out with Global entry and a 15 min delay of my flight to Tampa.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-27;"Smooth check-in in Lisbon. TAP Lounge is closed now, and no alternative is offered for the moment. Flight delayed 30 mins due to late arrival from previous sector. Nice, but not overly friendly cabin crew. Only one FA looked presentable, others looked shabby and tired, but still, they always smiled. Nothing special about food - little tray with hot pasta, one bread roll and tiny Mars bar. Boring. IFE streaming to your own device was a nice touch, but flight itself is nothing to remember.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-27;"When I arrived at Washington Airport from Tampa, easy connection with the new Subway-Skytrain to the Terminal with the Lufthansa Lounge. Gate to Munich is right next to the Lounge. Warm welcome from the ground staff, excellent food and wine. Easy boarding process for First Class due to a direct door from the lounge to the jet bridge of the plane. Very warm welcome from the cabin team. Very good food on board with excellent Service. One hour before landing I got my wake up call with a easy and lite breakfast. Overall a great flight. Easy and fast Immigration in Munich with Custom/Federal Police office in the Lufthansa Lounge. Pick up with the Limousine worked perfect to the small Airplane to Nürnberg,like everything worked out on this trip.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-25;"On Tuesday 7th of July 2015 we checked in to flight LH1285 to Frankfurt from Athens. When entering the aircraft we noticed that the seats in Business Class were the same as in economy and the legroom was the same. The seats were uncomfortable. Usually when you come into Business Class in an airplane you are greeted with a drink (water, juice or wine), but not on that flight. The stewardess did not pay much attention to us. No english newspapers. We had a little boy with us (8 years old) and when his mother asked for a pillow and blanket, only 2 pillows where found in the whole plane and 2 blankets. We waited a long time until food service started, even economy passengers in back of us got service before us. We were served 20 min later. As I said before the seats were very uncomfortable and as I am not a small man I could not put the tray all the way down because the legroom between the seats was not that much. 7th July 2015, Frankfurt to Keflavik Iceland, flight LH856. The same poor quality seats. We asked for a pillow and a blanket but there was only one blanket and no pillows in the whole plane. The reason we were given was that the plane came in over night and all blankets and pillows were used! The stewardess onboard was very nice and tried to calm me down, the reason she said that the seats weren´t better than this was that the flight was short haul. I fly all over Europe at least 15 times a year and everywhere, the Business Class has better seats. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-24;"Lufthansa used to be the best European airline, not least due to their care for ensuring connections even in case of delays. I am very disappointed that this appears to now be history. As a business class traveller with a Senator (Gold) card I would expect the best treatment so if I am treated as I have recently been, what must it be like for other customers? 1 hour delay from London Heathrow (about 30 minutes on arrival to Frankfurt), no busses there to meet the flight I guess is airport rather than airline problem. No information on the flight, the head purser first doubted that what I said about my onward flight, gave some wrong information and was later very rude as well as claimed that it is not Lufthansa´s task to give information (on a Lufthansa connection with a Lufthansa ticket?) this is most definitely a problem of the airline. With a direct transfer I would have made it, now it was a night in Frankfurt instead and arrival 13 hours late. Add to the misery that I was finally told, by the pilots, that I should hurry to the gate, although when I arrived the flight had left long ago so all the running was a total waste. Recently (end March 2015) on a late arrival from Amman to London, again with a Lufthansa through (business class) ticket via Frankfurt, I made it (running) to the gate for the next flight but no rebooking had been made and again, no information whatsoever from the flight crew. I am afraid Lufthansa is rapidly ceasing to be my first choice. What a shame, when only better information would deal with this problem. The very value for money that I used to appreciate - pay more but get something for it - rapidly slips with such treatment.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-24;"MRS-FRA Business class on an old Boeing 737, but breakfast was surprisingly delicious. Connecting in FRA extremely stressful (this airport is now worse than CDG), I had 60 mn to do it. It took 30 mins only to arrive at terminal, due to very very remote parking plus a lot of airplane traffic that stopped our bus. Then a long queue at Immigration, and very remote finger (Z62). Boarding had started when I arrived. Service on upper deck (FRA to KIX) was pleasant but slow, the food was delicious. Brand new flat seats, a bit too narrow, but pleasant anyway. Wine list : the weakest point. Germany has so many nice wines they could have offered but Italian and Chilean instead. Champagne at high standards. Luggage quickly delivered.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-07-22;"Boarded flight LH471 from Toronto Pearson to Frankfurt then LH632 from Frankfurt onto Amman. Used online check-in which was quite user friendly and smooth. Travelled with my disabled mother. She was helped into her seat by the very friendly cabin crew who escorted her from the aircraft entrance and I was helped with my onboard luggage. During the flight the flight attendants helped my mother with the food, something that I greatly appreciated. Upon arrival in Frankfurt we were met by very friendly and professional Lufthansa ground services personnel who escorted her and myself all the way to the Sheraton Airport hotel as there was a 12 hour wait between both flights and later came to the hotel to pick us up for our onward journey. The flight to Amman was on a small Airbus 320 however the cabin crew were extremely professional and helped us throughout. I am very pleased with Lufthansa and will certainly fly them again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-21;Flew BOM to BCN via MUC in June with 2 friends. Tried to do the online check in and it only worked for one of our tickets. When we got the the airport the lines for check in were long so we all went to the online check in counter and they allowed us to check in. Flight on time and boarding was quick. They serve a horrible roll after take off at 1am which was inedible. Seats quite uncomfortable. Headsets can hardly hear and this looked like a new aircraft. Crew was pleasant enough. Overall uneventful flight. Landed in MUC on time with a 40 minute connection and had to run for our next flight which we made with moments to spare. LH did nothing to make the connection easier which they so proudly advertise. Service on MUC to BCN much nicer - sandwich was lovely and fresh as was the coffee.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-21;"Lufthansa had a cheap offer for their newly introduced premium economy. Even though I used to prefer airlines with a stop-over we used LH direct flight due to the short travel time. The newly launched connection FRA-KUL is really worth the extra money. Lufthansa is clean, efficient and friendly. The seats were very comfortable, screen was big and food was ok. I slept for a straight 8hr and my wife slept 9.5hrs. We were really pleased with the service and comfort of this new connection/product. I haven't been a big Lufthansa fan in the past but this somehow changed my mind. We will come back.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-21;Flew LH from LIS to FRA on a Boeing 737-800. Flight on time. Check in at LIS was a breeze and flight on time. Breakfast served was okay and service was nice on this 3 hour flight. Got to FRA with a 2 hour connection. Had to get from one end of the terminal to the other and we kind of ran as we were a bit lost. Got to our gate and sat down to wait. After 30 minutes of waiting and near the boarding time I went to the desk to ask the status and was told we were delayed 3 hours. They did not tell passengers unless they asked and they never showed any change of timing on the information boards. LH then started handing out 5 euro meal vouchers- nothing in the canteen nearby was available to eat for 5 euros! Flight finally left 4 hours late and arrived at 5am in Mumbai instead of 1am. The food was awful. Seats on the 747 as uncomfortable as the A330. Crew were polite.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-20;"Check-in and boarding were efficient. On board it was a fresh looking A330 with new Business Class seats. These are an improvement over the older angled seats but they are inferior to pods found on other carriers. In the fully flat position there is little space for your feet and overall, the seat is narrow. Flight left late due to congestion at FRA and arrived slightly behind schedule. The service was fairly attentive with FA's smiling throughout the flight. The appetizer was delicious but my lunch selection was overcooked and was quite bland. There were a wide selection of spirits and drinks to choose from and the wines served were fairly good. Pre-arrival meal was tasty and the portions were quite big. The IFE had a poor selection of movies and lacked in the number of new releases for both movies and music although the Bose noise-cancelling headphones were a nice touch. Upon arrival luggage was delivered promptly topping off a good experience.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-20;"Departure procedures from Heathrow were very slow. The flight to Frankfurt was delayed, with no explanation offfered. No seating was available at the gate. It was a mater of just wait and don't block the passageway. No information was given on board about the connecting flights. No effort was made to fast track passengers to make connecting flights. Enroute to the gate to get the Johannesburg flight we were informed by other passengers that the flight had left. Again there were no announcements. No Lufthansa representative was assigned to deal with passengers that were stranded. The group was split as some passengers did not have visas to enter Germany. After much walking and asking random people what to do, we found a service desk with staff willing to assist. This was also stressful as it was late and everyone was going off shift. The airport was near deserted except for the confused and stressed passengers, some of whom were travelling with small children. We were given a taxi, hotel and meal vouchers for the overnight stay. We had no luggage so a change of clothes and toiletries were an issue. We have been re-routed via Lagos with a 6 hour layover. ";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-19;My original flight for my return to NZ was to Shanghai however due to Thunderstorms at Frankfurt the Paris flight was delayed and arrived an hour and a half late causing missed connection to Shanghai. Hope was given to us by the crew as they said everything was delayed and so we had a good chance but this was a false hope. On the Paris flight the English announcements were hard to hear as the sound was not turned up loud enough to overcome all those that had understood the German announcement and were now talking loudly. Attendants on Dubai flight were friendly and professional. There was mixed customer care when hundreds filed in to the customer service area. Some received overnight kits some received juice and water and some did not. The processing of people got faster when a second area opened up downstairs. Again mixed customer service. I got great service with all vouchers explained as well as clearly written on what was what as well as a meal voucher where as a lady I buddied up with didn't get as good service and no meal voucher. On return to Frankfurt airport the next day for rebooking great professional staff sorting out re ticketing of new flights. Accommodation was supplied in Frankfurt and also at layover on Dubai. This was fabulous. Overall my experience of Lufthansa is very good. I would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-19;"Check in was quick and efficient. While boarding the aircraft an announcement was made for priority boarding of business class passengers and those with Star Alliance Gold status. As a Gold member I moved into the priority line and when checking my boarding pass the gate agent complained about me going ahead even though the announcement clearly allowed for it. Once on board the aircraft was in pristine condition. As it was not a full flight I moved into a row all to myself and had a very comfortable journey. The FA's were not particularly friendly and performed the inflight service like preprogrammed robots. The dinner served was fairly basic but quite tasty. Flight left late but the crew me up for the delay resulting in on schedule arrival. The bags took nearly 40 minutes to come out and those tagged ""priority"" came out last. Overall it was a good travel experience but below the standard I have come to expect from Lufthansa.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-19;"The short flight from Manchester was very good, staff very nice, friendly and very helpful. Frankfurt to Johannesburg I was seated in Economy as usual, but just before take-off it was announced that seats were available in Premier Economy at the extra cost of 300 Euros. I asked a flight attendantif I could look at the seats before I committed to paying the extra money and she kindly took me through - I was delighted to see seats in this class were far superior to Economy. I agreed to pay the extra, was moved to my new seat and from then on my flying experience turned out to be one of the best I had ever had, it was brilliant, I felt that I was treated like a VIP. The flight attendant couldn't have been more helpful and kinder. I would defintely recommend Premium Economy to anyone. Thank you Lufthansa and your staff.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-18;"Flew from Heathrow to Barcelona via Frankfurt and back. Check in at Lufthansa at new Terminal 2 Heathrow at 06.00 in morning chaotic and lengthy - lots of passengers, too few check-in staff, check in equipment seemed not to be functioning well. Transfer at Frankfurt is complicated and long, compared with for example, Schipol, but better than Paris. All flights pretty full - but full compliments to Lufthansa cabin crew, very friendly and attentive given busy short haul flights. Complete punctuality. Also, a nice touch that pilot comes out of cockpit to say goodbye to passengers at end of flight. In contrast to Heathrow, check in at Barcelona extremely quick and efficient. All in all a good experience. ( As a bit of plane spotter, a bonus was that the LHR/FRA flight was on a retro livery Airbus!).";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-17;"First time flying with Lufthansa for a long haul flight. Seats, food, and entertainment systems were on par with other European carriers. The real winner here was the international in-flight WiFi capabilities. The service was a bit hostile and pretentious at time. The meal service seemed a bit rushed and flight attendants nagging passengers to finish.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-16;"My family took a long haul flight with Lufthansa to Berlin via Frankfurt. They only give us a transit time of 1 hour 5 mins. By the time we came down from the plane at Frankfurt, I happened to look up at a clock in the airport, and it was already 20 minutes into the transit time. We walked to the gate, and it was a long walk. An airport staff member stopped the whole group of passengers from going down to the immigration clearing area, which we had to pass through before we can reach our gate for the connecting flight to Berlin. He just said the area downstairs was too crowded, so we cannot go down. He held us up for 10-15 mins. Finally, we were allowed to go down, and there were only 6 staff doing the immigration clearance (as compared to over ten in Heathrow airport). That takes another 10 minutes or so. In the end, we reached our gate 2 mins late, and the plane had left without us. After that, customer service was non-existent. This is no fault of ours. They could not put us onto the next few flights as they were all full. We were told to go to the gate to wait and enquire if any passengers didn't show up. We tried this for one flight, and I refused to do it again. The next available flight was 5 hours later. But we would have reached Berlin too late for us to take another connecting flight to London. I have booked this BA flight some 4 hours plus after our supposed arrival time in Berlin. Yet we had to miss it. To add to the insult, we were told we had to take the flight to Berlin, or they would re-calculate the total cost. In the end, we had to pay out to get a connecting flight to London from Lufthansa.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-13;"The long haul IFE now includes a new upgraded touch screen PTV with a much improved content selection, and each seat has a USB charging port. It's airline food, but it's pretty good. Drinks and snacks available throughout the flight. Lufthansa product has greatly improved since the last time I flew this route, two years ago.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-09;"I was impressed and happy with the service, friendliness, food and entertainment on board. This was a big improvement to flights last winter with the old Business Class. The crew were great and the 10 hour flight went by quickly. The A380 is quiet and smooth in the air and LH has done some homework and the hard working flight crew made the difference. In my 16 years of flying the captain did greet the Ladies, gentleman and children on board.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-09;"The longest flight of Lufthansa. Crew was professional. Seats not so comfortable like Emirates or Cathay Pacific, but acceptable. For the price I paid, I expected more than I was given. Moreover, considering the lengh of the flight, the service should be very good, but it was decent. Entertainment system was ok and acceptable. To be honest, I don`t have anything to complain, maybe except the space for legs, but it is also difficult to find anything to praise in that service. ";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-07-08;"My journey was incident-free and my customer experience very good for an economy price. Staff were on the whole friendly, the planes were a good temperature, and there were only very small delays (20 mins for one connection). Food was nothing exciting but on planes it never is. I brought my own snacks. Entertainment system was a little less modern and the screen smaller than past experience, but it was still fine to pass the hours. Seat wasn't super comfortable and there wasn't loads of leg room, but with the blanket provided it was survivable. For the cheapest option around, that's all I had hoped for. As I said, the staff were friendly and well-presented. Only annoyance was that no-one came around between meals so any queries and assistance were hard to attain. Toilets were fine too. Not lovely, but they are plane toilets.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-08;"My partner and I were flying from Frankfurt to Hong Kong on June 28th - we sat at 34B/C. We were left no choice of meal options twice in a row as we were served last for both in-flight meals, dinner and breakfast. The crew served the meal from the same direction, from the back to front of the cabin both times, and when it’s our turn, we only got whatever was left. We can understand this the first time, but the second time it happened we didn’t get to choose our food, we felt being treated unfairly, and to us it clearly showed that Lufthansa did not care about attending to customers’ needs and respecting their right of choice. We paid our fares as everyone else! It is not about we really have to have that particular food, it’s about the fact this happened twice in a row and obviously did not respect customers choice. We have flown Lufthansa quite a few times, and were very disappointed this is the way Lufthansa treat their customers.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-05;"Smooth flight on upper deck of the Boeing 747-8. Seat is very comfortable. Food was excellent, crew upbeat and professional.  Pilot updated us on flight details frequently and a smooth landing. No idea why many critics here demand that the flight attendants smile for 12 hours, I always prefer friendly staff who I trust would act professional in an emergency case instead of a constant smile and no clue what to do if it counts.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-04;"This was our first time flying Lufthansa. While the organization that paid for my flight booked an economy ticket, I noticed the opportunity to bid on premium economy tickets for 3 of the 4 legs of our round-trip flights. Our bids were accepted for two of the flights, but not accepted for the third. Ironically, this is the one leg for which we had bid the most because we hadn't been able to secure good seats in the economy class. Even more ironic, when we checked in for this specific leg, we asked if there was an opportunity to upgrade class and we were able to do so at half the cost of what we had bid. Overall, the experience in premium economy was good. Much more room than the typical economy seat. But one leg was a bad experience. On the final leg, the seat map that we used to choose our seats was not accurate. It showed our two seats being in front of a set of bathrooms. When we boarded the plane, we found that our row was actually the first row after the bathrooms. Because we were on the side row, there was no wall or curtain between us and the bathroom. It essentially became a seven-hour flight sitting next to the bathroom. We would have been much better off with our original economy seats. I'm surprised that Lufthansa would not have designed this section better and that they didn't have a more accurate seat map.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-04;"Excellent airline! Seats very comfortable, flight attendants smiling. They surprised us by approaching my husband and wishing him a happy birthday (without us telling them it was his birthday) and gave him a chocolate gift! They provided a very tasty sandwich with a large variety of drinks. They do not charge for the luggage! ";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-07-01;"Check-in in Hannover quick, Lufthansa Business Lounge (access due to FTL status) stylish, friendly staff and good offer of drinks and breakfast - even scrambled eggs. Rest I flew Economy. Flight Hannover-Munich short 45 min service with full bar and muesli service. Munich is a great airport to transfer! Lufthansa offers all passgengers free coffee/cappuccion/tea from machines and free newspapers at the gates. Flight Munich-Istanbul also with new onboard connect wireless entertainment system on short/medium haul routes which is a massive improvment. You can use your tablet or notebook and have access to a variety of movies in different languages, music, flight map and: newspapers and magazines in different languages from the same day to download. Hot meal served by charming and professional flight attendends. On time and efficient.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-29;"Great airline, great service in Business Class and I love the Boeing 747-8. Super quiet aircraft with open spaces and lots of room for carry-on. IFE not being HD is a bit disappointing for a new aircraft.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-27;"TLV to FRA with A321 and then with Lufthansa train to CGN. Check-in was not easy, staff was slow and changed the counter several timers from economy to business to only drop off, so the queues changed and it was a big mix up. Could not upgrade as the plane was full. Flight was almost one hour late before take-off, no information given by ground staff at the gate, even though 5 staff were there. Onboard, crew was nice and service was ok, meal choice was chicken or beef and that was tasty. Arriving in Frankfurt was 15 minutes late,so we had 40 minutes to get to the LH train at the airport-station. Bags did arrive at Air rail-terminal on time, but it was not sure if our oversized luggage would arrive on time. Lost and found was kind to fill up a form, before our LH train leaves. Lost and found did a nice and very good job and they were very good and helpful. So we left for the train, on the platform the train was 5 minutes late, and one of the fine lost and found staff came with our bulk luggage to give it to us. That was a nice touch from the Frankfurt lost and found staff.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-27;"Short haul very basic, but excellent staff. Transfer in Frankfurt is quite a hassle, long distances to be walked. Crew on long haul flight were okay. Smiling seems an issue, but service is quick. Seating is pretty okay, both legs on refurbished A340-300 which is a really nice long haul aircraft, quiet and spacious. Quality of food more than decent. Drinks assortment not so good. All in all, good flights for a good price.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-26;"Excellent service on board, seat and bed very good, 3 point harness safety belt (like in your car) during take-off and landing!

Escorted in LAX from check in to lounge, but they did did not know where the Star Alliance lounge is.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-26;Flight departed 10 minutes lat. Service was efficient and a snack and drinks were served for the 1 hour flight. Overall experience was good but the seat was torture with no padding and what I assume was a metal rod in the lumbar region.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-24;"Bucharest to Aberdeen  return, via Frankfurt. Four uneventful short flights. Clean aircraft, in excellent condition, professional crews, smiling and attentive flight attendants. Ground staff OK too. Downsides: food, (wrapped tasteless sandwiches, only one round of drinks served), no entertainment and poor magazine, announcements from cockpit difficult to hear due to noise in the cabin. I recommend Lufthansa for direct or connection flights in Europe.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-23;"FRA to TLV. Arrived with LH train ticket via high-speed train in Frankfurt. On check in I asked for upgrade, since I have more than enough miles. Upgrade was granted and walked to their lounge in terminal C close to gate 14. This lounge looks like a more basic lounge and as it was before 10a,m the selection seemed limited. But after one hour we boarded the A321 for Tel Aviv. The plane is a basic Lufthansa plane for short haul, so there are no special Business class seats, only the middle seat is free, which gives you no more legroom. The crew was nice and served a pre-drink, as the flight was about 20 minutes late, due to high traffic in the air. Soon after take-off they served a nice Gin and Tonic with nuts. After that they started the food service on a tray. The food was nice with starter, salad, main dish and fruits. After that they served coffee and chocolate. The crew was fab and always smiling and doing a really good job.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-23;"Quick check in, though staff weren't friendly. Delayed flight resulted in missed connection - no apologies or customer service.

lufthansa;2015-06-21;"Overall rating of 7/10. The Lufthansa Business class lounge at Frankfurt is very nice. Great food and ground service. Business class seats are extremely comfortable, spacious and soft, but it costs a lot more than traveling Business class on Air France. The staff is polite. Great experience!

lufthansa;2015-06-20;Entertainment was very good with large screens and choice of videos. Food was good with very good choice of beverages. The cabin crew was very professional and friendly. No complaints.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-19;"The quality of the flight was quite good, especially the meals. The seat was comfortable if sitting upright but less comfortable if you are trying to recline for your night sleep. Overhead storage cabins are sufficient unless your fellow passengers are selfish and store too much there. Plenty of leg room even if I store my bags up front (talking about the window seats though). Service quality by the staff (attitude, promptness and helpfulness) was 4 out of 5. As for meals I was highly impressed because of their setting.  Metal cutlery (not plastic), menu to read, delicate desserts, and nice dishware. Other than that, the food is OK, the dinner being good while breakfast was  poor. Inflight entertainment is satisfactory and caters for different ethnicities, although entertainment systems in some seats could not display programmes listed in  magazine. ";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-06-13;"Quick day trip to Munich and impressed with Lufthansa, specially when compared to British Airways Club Europe. The LH lounge at T2 was wonderful, although crowded in early morning. The breakfast spread was fabulous by lounge standards. Staff told me the food is by Do & Co, and hope they can provide food to all LH lounges in future. Onboard service efficient and friendly staff, I like that they still offer you a good choice of magazines even on short flights. A light breakfast served, seats reasonably okay with middle seat empty. In MUC decided to try out the ""paid"" VIP Terminal on way back - wow! It is fabulous and even has its own beer garden and outside dining area. You get taken by car to foot of steps for boarding. Return flight a similar experience and even managed to avoid Heathrow congestion and land on time, with very quick walk to exit T2. Certainly recommend them and will use again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-12;"I wanted to fly LH 639, DXB to MUC. When we were ready for take off the air conditioning failed and plane returned to finger. Air conditioning was repaired, we took on more fuel then some more tests, eventually pilot announced ""doors park"" and ""flight cancelled - go back to departure gate where ground staff will take care of you"". We did, 3 ground staff had to take care to rebook some 300 passengers - a most unpleasant experience. I am sure the staff did their best but Lufthansa for sure didn't. During 5 hours wait in the queue they only offered some water inside the gate (the queue was outside), in 18 hours waiting time for the rebooked flight nothing else.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-12;We flew from Miami to Barcelona to catch a cruise and came back to Miami from Venice two weeks later. A380-800 on the long haul and A320-200 on the short flights. My wife needed and received through Lufthansa special services wheelchair assistance. The Lufthansa staff was wonderful and took care of all of our needs promptly. The meals in economy were very good and water and juice were distributed 4 times during the long haul flights. The staff were very welcoming throughout the flights. We try to fly Lufthansa whenever possible.;POSITIVE

Our intl luggage didn't make the connection all due to what LH called ""damage"" to the first plane which was solved with a 30 minute late arrival to BUD. We were traveling from BUD to IAD through FRA and it was gruelling and impossible for someone with bags or who can't sprint for 1 mile.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-06;I managed to travel on LH779 SIN-FRA in their new premium economy on the A380. The new seat is quite wide and offers space for your personal items. Once on board we were offered a welcome drink. The food was absolutely fantastic a dinner and breakfast was offered both hot and large in size I found the meals better that some airlines business class. Great entertainment system with lots on offer. Staff were friendly and quite interactive with passengers.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-06;FRA-LHR LH924 Business 29 May 2015. Seats are the same as economy with the only difference that the middle seat is always left empty. The food was really good. Our breakfast was comparable with the better breakfasts you would get on long haul flights (miles ahead of what you would get in north America or Japan). Very nice food. Cabin crew was attentive and very polite. The airplane was generally quite and provided for an overall very enjoyable flight. No IFE was available.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-06;Flew round trip from Denver to Frankfurt in May. As noted in previous reviews service was curt lacking in smiles or friendliness. Return trip the bathroom was the dirtiest smelliest mess I have encountered on a plane. Is anyone responsible for checking it during the flight? I have very low expectations of food on airplanes but these meals were worst I've ever had. What really has made me decide to never fly Lufthansa again is this: I paid extra to reserve seats in the first row of economy which has a partition in front of you instead of a row of seats and more leg room. When we checked in for our return flight we were told those seats were not available. I was told by customer service that paying extra to reserve a seat gives you no guarantee or rights to those seats and my request for a refund was denied. Absolutely terrible customer service in my opinion.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-06-01;I had 8 flights with Lufthansa last month on routes between London and Frankfurt Frankfurt and Gdansk (round- trip) Munich and Kiev (Round-trip) Frankfurt and Kiev (round-trip) Frankfurt and Gdansk (one way). Some flights were with City line subsidiary some with Lufthansa mainline. City line is better in terms of seat comfort (2-2 on Embraer aircraft plus good seat pitch) but no hot meal service. Lufthansa serves hot meal but seating is crowded and provides less comfort. Also City line crews mostly look disinterested. Ticket prices looked excellent value for money. A big letdown was Frankfurt airport experience. Not a single time had we embarkation or disembarkation via finger. Long bus rides only. To add insult to injury when boarding via bus they never used bus gates. We had 5 flights downstairs from Z gates designated for A380 only to stand for 25 minutes on the apron waiting for the bus to pick us up. Then 20 minutes on a bus standing and waiting for plane stand assignment. Overall very average. Flights are on time. Bags arrived safely.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;FRA-VRN. A short flight across the Alps from Frankfurt to Verona in an Embraer 190 a compact but efficient region jet. Bus across the tarmac hopped on friendly and efficient pilot service minimal but not needed flight seemed fast. Great views the Alps. A good way of traveling a reasonable distance quickly but train just as easier for slightly shorter European connections.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;"Travelled from Frankfurt to Hong Kong on 20 May. Thankfully connecting flight from Hong Kong to Adelaide was codeshare with Cathay Pacific who provide a true Premium Economy experience. LH served choice of 2 meals in foil trays coffee and tea in paper cups. Hot paper wipe was provided to freshen up Cathay provide a hot towel. Whilst cabin crew were efficient smiles were rare. Basic headphones provided rather than the noise cancelling variety provided by Cathay. No priority check in or boarding. Plastic tumbler of orange juice given as"" welcome drink"" just before take off. Cathay offer choice of sparkling wine sparkling water or orange juice served in a glass once you are settled in your seat. Blanket provided barely covered knees and legs. Cabin is only separated from economy by a small screen. Seats were comfortable with a reasonable incline although those on Cathay were larger and more incline. Think it is a stretch to call what Lufthansa offer Premium Economy. Disappointing. Better value would be to purchase an economy ticket in the exit row.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;"FRA-SIN in P/E. We had booked economy but gate staff announced a ""special"" price for surplus seats in premium economy. Well it wasn't bargain basement but a reasonable price. We had already enjoyed P/E on the way over to Europe so thought why not? P/E is well worthwhile and as mentioned for previous flights should be standard. It is just so more comfortable compared with economy but much more affordable than business. Food service all extremely good and IFE is now one of the best on any airline we have traveled with - fast and responsive with a good choice of channels. Lufthansa has had some mixed reviews but I feel it has lifted its game. A380 is a superb aircraft: super smooth and quiet. We arrived feeling surpassingly refreshed and I actually got some sleep on the overnight flight for once.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;LHR-FRA-HEL both on A321s. First flight left a little late. Food was a small sandwich or a museli yoghurt I had the latter which was ok for the length of flight. Plenty of drink options and an efficient crew. Quick transit in FRA then they decided to change the gate twice. I did receive SMS messages about this and the gate staff were apologetic. The flight to HEL left late as the aircraft was late in from Hamburg. Again good crew. 2 choices of small sandwiches neither I could eat due to some of the ingredients. The stewardess said she would try and find me an alternative and sure enough came back with a chocolate and nut croissant. Unusual for the time of day it was not bad at all and you cannot fault her attempt to find me something I could eat. Going that little bit further shows why LH is one of my favourite airlines. Shame arrival was some 50 mins late (first for me flying LH) but good value with a no nonsense but efficient service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;SIN-FRA in P/E. Despite having flown between Singapore and Europe several times in recent years this was my first experience of the A380 and I was a little in awe of this giant aircraft. It is an excellent airplane! It makes flying seem so effortless. Super smooth take off and landing and so much quieter than a B777. Legroom is the main advantage of P/E. We firmly believe all airplane seats should be this size. I find standard economy now is so cramped as to be almost unbearable on long flights. The premium is well worth paying for and much more affordable than business if you are paying yourself. IFE was superb fast and responsive and an excellent choice of both video and audio channels. Food was good if not remarkable and service was extremely prompt and polite. Getting on and off was fast. I don't usually sleep much on long flights but did manage to doze a bit and arrived feeling reasonably refreshed after a 12-hour flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-31;FRA-VRN. A short flight across the Alps from Frankfurt to Verona in an Embraer 190 a compact but efficient region jet. Bus across the tarmac hopped on friendly and efficient pilot service minimal but not needed flight seemed fast. Great views the Alps. A good way of traveling a reasonable distance quickly but train just as easier for slightly shorter European connections.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-29;YYZ-FRA-NAP I traveled home alone with my baby I didn't think it would be possible but my home-bound flight was an even better experience than my flight out. The staff were extremely helpful. On my first flight there was a problem with my pre-booked seat so I called customer service to ensure my return flight would be correct. The lady whom I spoke to was very helpful and made sure I got the bassinet seat. For the long flight the staff had little Lufthansa toys they gave my baby I really appreciated the thought and had not experienced this with another airline we've flown with. Staff on board constantly checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed and to see if I needed any assistance (baby slept the whole flight). I will only travel with Lufthansa in the future.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-29;I flew NAP-MUN-YYZ. I booked a seat ahead of time the aircraft was changed and I didn't get the seat I had booked. As I was traveling alone with an 11-month old it was important I had the correct seat. The flight was fully booked but the staff were wonderful trying to help me out they managed to find a seat where a lady was willing to switch with me so I at least had the single empty seat beside me and my baby wasn't kicking somebody for 9 hours. The man in the seat ahead of me however reclined his seat fully back 10 minutes into the flight and refused to move it forward even for the meals the staff did their best to make me comfortable. Both at the airport and on-board the aircraft the staff did everything in their power to make my travels as easy as possible. The aircraft itself was new and clean. I am average sized and there would have been plenty of space had I not had another person on my lap. I only gave a lower rating for food as it tasted good enough but I am a picky eater. They came around frequently to serve drinks. I will only fly with Lufthansa from now on.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-28;5 May BOM-MUC LH765. 5 May MUC-GVA LH2382. Business. Ground staff was unfriendly. Airline Grew Ok but nothing special. New b-class seats are not as good as other 4 star airlines. Not worth the money (for b - class at least).;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-27;BHX-FRA-GIG 27/04/15. Return EZE-FRA-BHX 18/05/15. Flight from Birmingham with layover at Frankfurt then on to Rio De Janeiro was nearly faultless. Cabin crew were very attentive and friendly. The equipment used was 747-8 which was a delight fly on. Good selection of in-flight entertainment and food was also good. I asked for a pack of toothbrush and toothpaste and was given straightaway without questions asked and the lady FA had a friendly smile. Flight back from Buenos Aires was somewhat hit and miss. They were asking passengers for an upgrade for a minimum cost. I spent sometime travelling around South America and was down to my last few dollars so wasn't able to avail their promo. I found out later the they have upgraded quite a few passengers even though some of them were not frequent fliers. I am a Miles and More member and also I have got a frequent flier from SK which belongs to Star Alliance and I earned my points for quite some time now. I felt left out by the upgrade and so I asked one of the staff why the Miles and More members had been left out and my queries were rudely brushed aside telling me that 'You only fly economy'. Some of the FA's on board were friendly enough apart from one female FA with a really bad attitude. When I asked for a pack of toothpaste and toothbrush she immediately told me off they haven't got any and why did I bother to asked because I was in the economy section and then she walked away. When I asked one of her colleagues I was immediately handed a pack. I thought that being a Miles and More membership had gone to waste. I'll be thinking twice about flying with Lufthansa again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-20;Muscat-Frankfurt (stopover in Doha) on A330. Easy check in and boarding followed by exceptional service by kind and professional FAs. My special meal was acceptable better than normal. IFE was excellent with plenty of choices.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-20;KUL-FRA LH783 17 May 2015 Business. Extremely comfortable flight. Airplane was very tidy and clean and the new seats are lay flat a considerable improvement with respect to the old Lufthansa business class seats. They provide the possibility to chose the seat firmness and include massage. Meals are top notch. there is wide variety of beverages (I got a fantastic passion fruit juice before taking off). Flight was on time and very smooth indeed. Cabin crew was very attentive. In flight entertainment was very good with a wide range of movies in each category. A superb flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-12;Flew Philadelphia - Madrid via Frankfurt on May 1 2015. The flights were on time planes clean and the flight crews friendly. Catering was good. The reason I write this us that the Big Three US airlines provide mediocre - at best - service in economy and could learn how to improve their service and still make a huge profit. Lufthansa was very impressive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-12;LH453 24/3/2015. LAX-MUC economy class. Seats were extremely comfortable and with lots of space. Meals were very good. Inflight entertainment was good with new several new releases and a reasonably vast choice of movies Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I have non doubt that the service provide on this flight was comparable (if not better) to that provided by other 5-stars rated airlines.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-12;LH452 21/3/2015. MUC-LAX business class. 5 star treatment. Flat seats very nice choice of food and extremely friendly and helpful cabin crew. The choice of in-flight entertainment is quite good although the overall number of move is available in each category is not very large (20ish). One of the better airlines to fly business class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-11;Flew TLV-FRA-JNB on April 15 2015. Had a very nice experience A321 from TLV then A380 to JNB. I travel with LH quite frequently and am always pleased with them especially on their A380s. Downside was the price. VERY expensive but I am a Star Alliance member and am collecting miles so It was fine. Food was Salmon and rice then a Steak. A lot of new movies and latest releases.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-08;Lufthansa flight LH0408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on Monday April 27 2015. Flight crew was efficient but not especially friendly. The food was the worst airline food I have ever been served. I asked for Diet Coke with the meal and was given a small glass that was half full.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-05-01;Flew SFO-FRA on the A380. 11hr 20min in Y. Boarding at SFO was a mess because of some bad handling of their staff regarding priority boarding of disabled people that were flying with us. On board IFE had a decent selection touchscreen not very responsive though. They served dinner and breakfast in the morning. Honestly both were quite good. Staff were smiling even during breakfast in which they surely looked tired but they kept a professional attitude. They gave us a pillow and a blanket (which were acceptable) and the headset (terrible sadly). During the flight water was distributed frequently and you could also serve yourself in the galley for some snacks or some juice and the staff was gald to help. The recline is not bad at all but the pitch is really lacking sadly. No mood lighting also (which would have been a nice touch). Capt spoke frequently to the cabin also because of some sustained turbulence we had that interrupted breakfast: he assured everything was alright but we were unlucky as some strong tail winds shook us for a good part of an hour on the Atlantic. After we landed it was a mad rush to the connection with Air Dolomiti to Verona: FRA is quite huge and we only had an hour or so. All in all a good experience: I find that atm what sets apart an airline with an another is their staff which I found really helpful kind and respectful. I would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-30;KIX-FRA-MXP. Despite the longest security check at Osaka Kansai that I remember once onboard the flight was very good. Both flights on time good comfort on the 747-400 and kind flight staff. Transfer at FRA a bit long but overall ok. Good IFE quality choice fairly good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-30;MXP-MUC-HND. First leg on time (not many snacks considering it was lunchtime). Second leg on an A340-600 plane full and upgraded to business. Good seat comfort and very good service from flight crew. IFE was good in both quality and choice. Despite a delay for tech issues before departure a very good travel experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-28;"I flew LH710 FRA-NRT on an old 747-400. This plane was very old. Most cramped plane I have been on. My IFE screen was broken so I wasn't able to watch movies for eleven hours. Cabin crew wasn't that nice. One steward didn't smile at all. I would have expected more from a ""4 star airline"". Food was ok nothing special. All in all it was an awful experience. This was definitely my last time with LH!";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-27;Flew Kuwait-Frankfurt business class via Airbus 330-300 then Frankfurt-Miami Business Class on the Airbus 330-800. Service was fine and efficient as is typical of Lufthansa. The comfort was awful-seats were so narrow and hard. The worst I have experienced frankly. Never again will I fly them-especially spending all that money on business class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-24;I flew LH 520/521 MUC-MEX-MUC on A340-600 recently and need to say everything was as good as it can be in economy. A good flight for LH as the flight was fully booked. Flight attendants polite and friendly food nice drinks offered throughout the flight good IFE and much improved monitors and film selection. Enough information from the cockpit.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-20;MAD-FRA-JFK. Airport experience in FRA was absolutely the worst. However on board product and service is excellent. First leg on the A321 full bar service and tasty hot breakfast was served despite being a short 2-hour flight. Service was excellent and attentive. Second leg on the A380 and sat on a small section of Economy class on the upper deck. There was a dedicated flight attendant for the mini cabin and service felt very personalized and private. He was extremely attentive caring and friendly. Lunch was delicious and substantial and so was the pre- arrival snack. IFE had a good selection of movies TV shows and cool features like the tail camera and the screen was of decent quality and responsive. Seats were comfortable and reclined a lot although under seat storage was extremely limited due to the IFE box. Despite that minor grip Lufthana's product is definitely top-notch and I have to commend their excellent in flight service from their crew.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-19;"I flew with Lufthansa for a connection flight the duration of which was likely no more than 3-4 hours it was a short-haul flight. I needed to freshen up before landing there were no seatbelt signals up so I seized the opportunity to use the lavatory to freshen up. As soon as I finished and exited the lavatory there was a flight attendant waiting for me. I opened the door and this woman was standing in front of the restroom with what seemed like arms folded and a scowling face as though I'd done something wrong. No I wasn't in first class and yes my ""freshening up"" in the lavatory may have taken some time. But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom. She said not one word and basically stared me down as I walked back to my seat. Needless to say the customer service was lacking from the flight staff and I will never fly with Lufthansa again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-16;ARN-MUC-DEL and return from 2 April to 12 April. ARN-MUC and return both operated by A320s MUC-DEL with an A346 and DEL-MUC with a refurbished A333. ARN-MUC departed on-time had checked-in online and we had selected our seats. Everything was as planned our seats did not get mixed up like they usually do on other airlines. Boarding was smooth as expected. The flight was 100% full overheard the flight attendant saying that not a single seat was empty didn't also find an empty seat when I looked around. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive overall the flight was very pleasant. Next flight was MUC-DEL onboard an A346 unfortunately it was a plane with the old IFE and seats but the outstanding service by the friendly flight crew compensated for it. Food was great didn't expect that good food from LH. Legroom was enough for this flight we landed 20 minutes late in Delhi due to thunderstorms in the area. DEL-MUC operated by an A333 with the new cabin very clean plane. It had the new IFE which was very neat looking however I think they need to add more popular albums and more movies. The legroom wasn't great but it was enough for me I'm 177 cm tall. The flight attendants were extremely friendly on this flight as well in fact all of the LH flight attendants were friendly. I don't like to eat breakfast on my flights but the food wasn't bad flight landed exactly on-time in Munich. MUC-ARN once again operated by an A320 flight was on-time with friendly flight attendants again. They served a sandwich on this flight which was not bad. Overall I'm very satisfied with Lufthansa's service very nice flight attendants they also had very helpful ground crew at DEL. I would gladly fly long-haul with them again!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-16;"4/10/2015 FRA-LAX LH 456. Lufthansa from FRA to LAX on A380 economy class and won't repeat this mistake anytime in the future. Seat pitch is listed as 31"" but felt more like 28"". Width is listed as 17"" and that felt about right. Seat configuration is 3-4-3 which is pretty much standard. It was just too cramped again I believe the pitch that Lufthansa list is wrong as I've never felt so tight with a 31"" pitch and I've recently lost 25 pounds. All else was great. Food was above industry standard staff were polite and attentive after meal drinks were plentiful and included brandy wine and beer at no charge. Snacks were passed out during duration of flight. Flight entertainment was weak but having a place to charge my laptop was handy as well as WiFi although slow and charged at 17euro. Unfortunately I have a bad back and will have to take a different carrier next time out.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-16;I went from Frankfurt to Singapore in a A380. Lufthansa had changed my prepaid comfort seat to a standard seat because of an equipment change. Drinks and food came in the wrong order. No menus were distributed. Staff were not service minded and looked more interested in playing with their smartphones in the gallery. Movies could not be seen with English subtitles. Not the level I expect from Lufthansa.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-12;Short flights FRA-VIE LH1138 and VIE-FRA LH1137 in April. Excellent flight experience concerning all aspects. After security check in FRA Lufthansa offers coffee and hot drinks for free and also a wide selection of international and German newspapers. During the flight you get a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Seats are comfortable for short haul flights legroom is good. Captain kept us informed about flight route arrival time and weather at destination airports. Cabin crew was fantastic attentive smiling and charming. LH is highly recommended for European flights!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-12;OSL-FRA-TXL-FRA-OSL. A couple of hours after I checked-in online the day before I was supposed to travel OSL-FRA- TXL Lufthansa sent me an sms to inform me that my Lufthansa OSL-FRA sector was cancelled due to Lufthansa pilots being up to one of their capricious strikes again. This Lufthansa cancellation caused me a lot of inconvenience. Furthermore it was all in vain trying to call Lufthansa's reservations in Norway and elsewhere in Europe - lines were too busy to get through. So despite my very busy schedule I went to Oslo's Gardermoen airport where SAS do the ticketing for Lufthansa. In a very short time SAS rebooked me on the SAS direct morning flight from Oslo to Berlin-Tegel therefore greatly reducing the inconveniences caused to me by Lufthansa and Lufthansa pilots on strike. I paid extra to fly on Lufthansa as I had to be in Berlin early but in hindsight SAS was cheaper more reliable and better than the competition on this occasion - paying a premium to fly Lufthansa resulted as a waste of money time and effort (given the pilots strike not just SAS but also Norwegian and Ryanair would have been better on this occasion). On the return sectors TXL-FRA-OSL the service was very good and significantly better than I what experienced lately on Lufthansa. However all in all this is was the second time in the space of just 3 months that the industrial disputes between Lufthansa and capricious Lufthansa pilots caused me inconveniences while travelling between Oslo and Berlin. This time the inconveniences were not acceptable to me and as a result similar future travel arrangements will be on other Star Alliance carriers but preferably not Lufthansa.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-06;HKG-MUC on LH 731 seat 10D. The new seat is rather small (~ 47 cm in width) but it is almost flat. The screen for entertainment is approx. 15 inch. Lots of films and musics as well as documentation to watch. Food was good there are less magazines to read than in the past. The new seat is somewhat smaller but you can sleep better since it is almost flat. Impressive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-04-04;In March of 2015 I flew from Vancouver to Frankfurt. As a world traveler I have experienced my fair share of cramped seating but was particularly appalled with the quality of the seating on this flight given that it was an 8-hour flight. The seats bordered on being hard-back chairs with little decline and poor leg room and width. This coupled with a mediocre audio-visual system and totally bland inflight food service left little to like about the airline. Granted the staff were helpful and friendly but in the end I just hated this flight. Impressive.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-28;Travelled on March 18th from Minsk to Barcelona with a layover in Frankfurt. Both flights were perfect. Great thanks to all the crew members for excellent service and comfort. Yesterday on March 25th took the same flights back from BCN to MSQ! The first flight was rather nice but the plane from Frankfurt to Minsk experienced some technical problems and we had to fly back to Germany. But all the staff members both in the airport and on the plane acted very professionally. We got a new plane and landed safely in Minsk. Impressive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-25;I travelled from Kuwait to Frankfurt and back for one night on 17th/18th March. Both flights had the new Business Class seat which is excellent. On both flights the crew were attentive and smiling and the food was very good. Check in at Kuwait was fast and efficient as was the boarding (for an early departure). The flight was short at just over 5 hours 30 minutes but the crew was relaxed and not rushed offering drinks a nice snack and a choice of breakfast. Returning from Frankfurt was equally pleasurable from check in to arrival with only a small delay due to congestion at Frankfurt Airport. Another good flight to Kuwait with equally good crew and catering. Impressive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-23;LH 414 11/3/2015. I've been and still am a loyal flyer to LH for more than 10 years but now its network of connections (LH and Star Alliance in general) is getting less competitive and forcing me to evaluate alternatives: in the US I'm forced to fly with alternative airlines. In Italy where I live connections to AOI airport have been cut and now I'm frequently going SkyTeam. I'm not happy with this.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-23;Between Munich and London Heathrow. The flight was on time the aircraft (320) was clean and comfortable. The catering is good quality and staff friendly. Was good first flight with Lufthansa and would choose again.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-03-20;Flew from VCE to FRA and from FRA to DUB economy class ticket. The crew on both flights were extremely polite and kind. On the VCE to FRA flight we had to wait in the aircraft for around 45 minutes due to problems with snow in Frankfurt. Some people were worried that they would miss their connecting flights but the crew and flight attendants kept us informed about all delays and changes. I got my flight to Dublin on time and it also had a slight delay. I have flown with Lufthansa most of my life and I am very satisfied with the airline. The food however is like with all other European and American airliners if you fly on an economy class ticket.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-20;"LH903 - LHR/FRA - A320 - 27 Jan. The check-in service at LHR was exceptional and one of the best check-in experiences I have had. As I was a premium customer the agent gave me an exit row seat and kept the next seat to me vacant. The service changed for the worst in the departure lounge. First of all they announced boarding for business class and Star Alliance Gold customers. I skipped over to that line to board only to be hauled up by an abrupt and loud ground crew member to be told in front of everyone that ""we are only boarding business class and Gold Star Alliance customers"". I had pleasure in telling her I was a Star Alliance Gold Member (actually Elite with Air New Zealand) and I then boarded. In this day and age no one should ever presume that only people wearing Savile Row suits and Italian shoes are the Premium customers. The rest of the flight was typical LH clean plane efficient and professional cabin crew with pilots getting us there before time and baggage being unloaded within minutes.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-20;LH 402 Mar 8 2015 from Frankfurt to Newark. There was a standard that on Star Alliance flights the gold members got following standard benefits on board. a) Priority boarding b) personal invitation on board by the steward c) free seat next to passenger's one to provide more comfort (if possible). On this flight everything was wrong. Boarding was chaotic there was no priority boarding. No invitation. The flight was not overbooked but stewardess seated another person next to me so she reduced my flight comfort significantly. She could have seated that person easily somewhere else. It didn't happen for the first time. The service standard of Lufthansa has decreased a lot during last 9 months.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-20;I recently experienced a great and very comfortable Business Class flight with Lufthansa from Munich to Miami. Perfect service very professional helpful and friendly crew. The food was delicious and a nice variety of wines was served. Everything very clean comfortable seat that was converted into a full flat bed. So I could get some hours of sleep. Very clean plane and technically in perfect shape as far as I a business person could see. Great service so I can highly recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-20;MUC-TLS-MUC on March 12 and return March 16. The flight was operated by Lufthansa's CITY LINE with an E195. I love this aircraft. The crew to Toulouse were very nice and happy to passengers opposite on the way back. Presented themselves a little arrogantly. The service was a sandwich and a drink service. Fine with me. However they served the exact same sandwich on the way back. I am happy that Swiss will fly as of May 1 2015 directly to TLS so I don't have to fly to MUC to change.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-20;"Out of EWR and in in FRA on time. Nice welcome on board. Fine food and huge choice of on board entertainment. Nice to wake up with a ""good morning"" caress and a real Espresso.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-17;I traveled from FRA to LAX on a brand new Lufthansa Boeing 747-8i. The plane itself was in great condition with a wide selection of entertainment programmes and friendly staff providing good service. But economy seating was absolutely not acceptable in terms of seat dimensions. I am a pretty average sized male (187cm 90kg) and my shoulder width was wider than the seat. Same goes for my seat neighbour which meant that we had to sit uncomfortably bent and twisted or get personal. The forward distance was so narrow that my face was only 5 inches from the back of the forward seat when it was moved fully backwards. I tried to avoid the whole thing by upgrading to Premium Economy but I learned that a regular Economy ticket was not eligible for an upgrade. Only Eco Flex tickets can be upgraded but they are so expensive that I would go straight to Business Class instead of buying one of them. Overall I am still wondering what all these bonus miles on my account are good for. Conclusion: When I have an alternative on a direct connection next time I will give the competitor a try. Lufthansa's problem aren't overpaid crews but a lack of respect to the needs of passengers.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-17;Flew Business Class from Newark to Stockholm and return to JFK both via Frankfurt. Outbound on 747-800. Beautiful plane and has a high tech feel. New Business Class is nice but somewhat cramped - the seats are very narrow and there is really no storage space. The angled seats puts your feet uncomfortably close to your neighbors. Service on board was very professional and attentive. The meal out of Newark was surprisingly good with an excellent fillet mignon but ground service was lacking - boarding was delayed by almost an hour after it was announced for unclear reasons and the lounge was crowded with terrible internet. Connecting flight on A321 - just economy seats for business class price. Nice service but terrible product. Return was supposed to be on United from Frankfurt but flight delayed for 7 hrs due to mechanical so switched to LH400. Again impeccable service but meal as is standard for Lufthansa out of Frankfurt barely edible - tough lamb with weird vegetables. Desert so small one needs a microscope to see it. The breads served were the best part of the meal. The biggest problem is Lufthansa's angled business class seat. The most uncomfortable business class seat in the air. The IFE system had very limited choices. We circled JFK due to a bad snow storm and then waited for gate forever - total delay of 2.5 hrs. but the crew kept everyone informed and were very nice. Bottom line - highly professional service with sub par cabins.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-17;LH475 from YUL to MUC on Airbus 333. Used the priority check-in for Star Alliance Gold and was served by a very efficient duo of agents. They moved me forward in the cabin and put me in a seat which had a good chance of having the neighbouring seat empty. It also provided extra legroom as it was in a transition row. Aircraft was spotless and bright and the pullback from the gate was on time. Service by FA's was efficient professional and attentive. Two choices of main course was offered for dinner and the food quality was good for Economy. There were several drink rounds throughout the overnight flight and breakfast was served prior to landing. IFE was expansive and offered a great choice of recent movies and other entertainment. Bathrooms were spacious bright and kept clean. Seats were as comfortable as one can expect in Economy and provided reasonable legroom. Flight arrived on time and we were kept informed by the captain at just the right points in the flight. Another great experience with Lufthansa they seldom disappoint.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-17;LAX-MUC on an A340-600 (newly reconfigured with Premium Economy). Had the aisle bulkhead in the front of economy. LOTS of legroom though the IFE and tray are both in the armrest (fine by me). Seat was very comfortable and I slept well. Crew were excellent as was the food. Got to watch 2 recent Oscar winning films in the IFE. I love the A340's having the economy class toilets downstairs. Wish LH flew directly to New Zealand: they would have my money every time.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-03-09;I flew from Frankfurt to Tokyo and back on am A340-300. Both flights were excellent with good efficient service and responsive in flight entertainment. The wifi (paid service) was excellent and really helped to pass the time during the long 11-12hr flights. One passenger had an eating disorder and for some reason there had a misunderstanding and Lufthansa didn't have a meal for them. I was very impressed how the chief purser went out of her way for the passenger offering him food from business class and at one stage even her own food! The outbound flight was delayed due to a technical malfunction just as we were taxiing to the runway. However was impressed with how Lufthansa handled this. The pilot kept us informed several times and we were only delayed by an additional hour. Overall I highly recommend Lufthansa!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-09;As large person (6ft 4in) it is almost impossible to sit in one of the standard economy class seats! I learnt that with the cheaper tickets a seat reservation is no longer possible. So even if you check in online (24 hours prior to the flight) only middle seats are available - absolutely impossible for people like me! I had luck that one person didn't check in so one of the seats with additional leg space was available. The crew supported me in this (the woman at the check-in told me that the seat maybe would be available and I should ask at the gate as I've arrived at the gate they already were informed). So this time leg space was no issue but if you don't like close contact to your neighbors you will not stay in the seat for a long time! You can't sit erect you have to buckle. I've spend more than 50% of the time walking around and chatting with the very friendly crew. For me (not paying an extra charge) this seat was OK. But for my neighbor who paid extra it was annoying - he like me was more walking around than sitting in the insufficient seat!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;LH 418 a very reliable airline. An improvement that they have introduced Premium Economy class. On this specific flight the crew offered water regularly. The inflight entertainment is a little outdated. A positive was the Hotspot / Internet access which allowed me to do some work.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;Business class on BCN-FRA-DEL. BCN-FRA flight was decent (same seats as economy nothing to write home about good breakfast warm service) but for some reason was parked halfway down the Rhine valley when it arrived in Frankfurt. Took over 40 minutes to make my connecting flight at literally the other end of the airport. For some reason Frankfurt airport staff thought it necessary for all buses to wait for all passengers to leave the aircraft before staring the long trek to the terminal instead of a bus starting off when full. FRA-DEL flight was on the A380 with the old style angled flat seats. Given that both of Lufthansa's supposedly downmarket brands (Swiss and Austrian) have better long haul business seats Lufthansa has no excuse for continuing with this substandard product. To add to the cost-cutting feel the portions of food served on the flight seemed smaller than those I've gotten in the past on LH. At least the IFE worked fine and has good choice and the staff tried hard to keep the passengers happy. Would recommend flying Lufthansa business only if flying on an aircraft with the new business class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;Flew on LH 958 FRA/BHX on 22 February in business class. The cabin staff did not even bother to close the curtain separating business from economy throughout the entire flight that tells you everything you need to know about Lufthansa's incredibly poor short haul domestic product. I had transferred from a long haul flight where I experienced the new business product which is excellent. I guess the business cabin on short European flights is used mainly by connecting long haul business class passengers - surely nobody would actually pay to fly business on only a short haul flight at least not on LH group carriers.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;"Birmingham to Venice 20/2/15. As a frequent traveller whose budget only stretches to economy class we were very impressed.

We all had a very comfortable flight and will definitely fly with Lufthansa again.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;"IAD-IST (via FRA) in economy on February 21 2015. I arrived at IAD during a bad snowstorm. The gate counter showed the flight as ""on time"" until the 748 showed up 60m before the scheduled departure time. Departure was then delayed by 90 minutes. The American agents at the gate weren't very polished about it but not too bad either. They were able to give me my new arrival time in Istanbul (3.5h later than originally planned). We boarded but needed to de-ice and it took 2.5h between boarding and taking off. I am glad I had had a snack at IAD! The captain was frustrated and very apologetic throughout. This was my 2nd flight on LH 748 and although I love the Queen of the Skies the 748 economy cabin is not pleasant. It is very chopped up and you don't have that Wow feel you should have in a 747. I was on the first aisle seat behind the premium economy which means that the aisle abruptly narrowed and I was ""in the way."" Dinner was fine and the choice of entertainment was great. Because of the delay I had a rushed transfer at FRA where the passengers needed to take a bus to board (no jetway for the IST flight). The flight to IST on a spotless A320 was uneventful. Good lunch but no entertainment at all. All in all Lufthansa did well considering the storm. But on my way back Turkish Airlines and United were just as good if not a little better.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-03-04;"I choose Lufthansa over other transatlantic carriers because I have and continue to experience excellent service even in the economy class. I do wish however that Lufthansa had not followed the lead of United in the reduction of space in regular economy class and the introduction of a ""premium"" economy class for an excessive amount of additional fare. The space in the ""regular"" economy class has become too tight. Service continues to be good although the ""snack"" before landing in Chicago left much to be desired. The flight attendants on this particular flight (LH 430 on February 25) provided excellent service in a friendly and accommodating way. The interface between the Lufthansa and connecting United flight was better than I have experienced in the past although I believe that United continues to be the weak link in the Star Alliance particularly with regard to US-domestic flights that connect with Lufthansa international flights. United's service simply doesn't compare with Lufthansa's and their flights are frequently delayed or canceled.";POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-02-24;"LH475. Overall a good flight. Very full so no free seat at all in the cabin. Staff very friendly. Cabin very modern. I had requested an Asian vegetarian menu however it turned out as a ""normal"" tasteless vegetarian rice and vegetable. Staff tried and provided some veggie pasta which was ok. Overall satisfied with the flight.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-24;LH 979 13th Feb 2015. DUB-FRA in Business Lufthansa Europe services greatly improved in 2014 and 2015. Very friendly cabin crew and the pilot provided detailed information about the flight. Optimal work conditions during the flight. For Lufthansa Business Class three different price levels are available so that cheaper options could also be purchased.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-24;FRA-BOG-FRA on A340-600. As often with Lufthansa I found the flights satisfactory but not outstanding. Airplane looked new the cabin was in good condition and clean (the bathroom less so at least after a few hours into the flights). Beverages were served several times selection and quality were good. Food was o.k. but nothing to rave about except for the very tasty passion fruit cream for dessert on the flight back and the chocolate in between. I am glad though that again there was a vegetarian option. Service was quite friendly and attentive. For a tall person though the space in Lufthansa's Economy Class is really sub-standard: narrow seats leg room barely alright if the person in front of you has the seat in an upright position but very uncomfortable if that is not the case. My seat neighbor who had a center seat could hardly get out of the row. The space on Avianca's A318 for a domestic flight before that was definitely more generous and did not feel as claustrophobic. The IFE touch- screen did hardly react on both flights. Changing the program was therefore difficult.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-24;LH 457 LAX-FRA 9th February. It was my first trip with a 747-8 and it was a great experience. I had a real good seat - 27K where I could feel comfortable and very good space to be an economy seat. Lufthansa always offers me a good service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-24;LH429. The seat comfort in Economy Class is bad compared to other airlines. Even for people with a normal body height it is not comfortable to sit for 8-9 hours. Sleeping is nearly impossible due to steep position of seat back. Due to excellent reputation of airline I still tend to travel with LH and recommend to friends.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-18;Trip FRA-SIN and BKK-FRA on A380/A340 respectively. Friendly crew good service. IFE has improved too. New seats in economy are OK but seem of poor quality as the recline function was already faulty after not a very long-time in service. I always notice that the crew 'vanish' after their routine service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-18;We flew FRA-SIN-FRA in business class. They have really improved their service offering. Now you get slippers and socks which does make perfect sense when you want to go to the restroom. They serve champagne in champagne glasses and finally serve espresso too. The crew to SIN was very friendly and courteous and took great care of us. On the return it was a little less overwhelming less smiles. IFE in general great more quality than quantity I prefer that. On return flight our screens didn't work and they didn't do much about it apart from suggesting we should sleep. Middle eastern Airlines really made a point and now all the others must follow if they want to stay in business. Advantage goes to LH their crews interact with customers .It's all a bit bland but what you see is what you get.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-12;"LH475 Montreal - Munich. Almost fully booked. Seats (Economy) quite comfortable but a little more space would be great. Service nearly perfect very friendly staff. Catering very good (dinner) except the ""snack"" in the morning (sweet stuff). Lufthansa is getting better and better.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-12;LH434 Munich to Chicago 26th January. Had multiple trips to the US with Lufthansa over the past couple of months and service timing and equipment was always perfect. Could recommend it fully but Economy seats should have a little more space.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-12;Flight: LH430 FRA-ORD. Excellent crew good IFE very good food. Economy Seat could be improved.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-12;Washington Dulles to Frankfurt. 19/1/2015. My first time in Premium Economy and it's been fantastic! Its not as cheap as Economy Plus on United but you can't compare that! Far more leg space fantastic seats where you can nearly lay down as in Business Class food and drinks served with style and great taste! For my next trip I will book Premium Economy for sure. It's 100% worth it!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-06;LH460 22/1/15. We booked Lufthansa for our flight from Munich to Miami a 11.5h flight. We wanted to avoid an awkward flight with no space therefore we chose LH and paid more compared to other airlines. They say: there is no better way to fly. Honestly this was the poorest flight over the Atlantic. Absolutely no space to sit a domestic flight usually offers more space. The touchscreens almost were not controllable. You could touch them but they did not react so we could not really enjoy the inflight entertainment. The stewardess tried to help she was nice rebooted the system several times but it did not really work as it was to supposed to. Will never do it again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-02-06;The crew on the reviewed flight to the USA was great - very attentive and always friendly which isn't self-evident with regard to Lufthansa. The food was ok but the portion was too small for such a long flight (~11.5 hrs). The seat is very uncomfortable (hard and small cushion) my back and posterior already hurt after sitting there for 2 hours. Nevertheless it was better than a regular seat in Economy Class since I had at least a bit of legroom because I paid extra for an Emergency Exit Seat. I think it is very inappropriate to charge that much money for an Emergency Exit Seat. Overall experience was ok but not great.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-30;LH 435 on 24th January 2015. Flight was very nice and punctual! Service very good! Business Class Lounge (of United) in Chicago is rubbish! Not really worth going there! No Flair no real comfort - just very cold and without any expression! Biggest disappointment on this trip! Otherwise the flight was good!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-28;LH 797 Hong Kong-Frankfurt Jan 18 on B747-8. Really impressed by the new LH Premium Economy which I could use for the very first time. Check-in friendly and quick. Boarding efficient. On board a very friendly crew. Once I had taken my seat welcome drink was offered to all passengers in this section. Nice amenity kit at every seat. The seat is simply great much more space than in normal Economy big IFE-screen with huge entertainment options. This was one of the drawbacks of flying Lufthansa but they finally improved it. Meal service from a menu 3 main dishes to chose from. Well presented on fine china. Due to departure at midnight service very efficient but never looked stressed. Wanted to give us more time to sleep. The seat is very comfortable good enough to sleep for 6 hours or so. Of course can't compare with their new Business seats which are top notch. During the night staff came around with drinks and snacks. Breakfast could have been better in my opinion. But that's the only negative point. In all Lufthansa is getting a real premium carrier. Staff excellent efficient friendly and professional.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-28;LH 428 flight to Charlotte/USA was the introduction of new Premium Economy at this connection. Had a chance experiencing this new offer and was satisfied. Seat very spacious in economy and service upgraded compared to standard economy. A good option for the money having more room better service and comfort.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-23;LH 457 1/15/15. My first time in Premium Economy. I will never fly business again. The leg space was great the seat did not incline like in business but still enough to enable me to sleep. The service was ok+ of course not like in business but still very good food and drinks were more than sufficient. I also have to mention the excellent service at the gate. I had been on the waiting list for an upgrade to business which had gone lost though. In premium economy there were only middle seats left which I didn't like. The attendant behind the desk looked into it and found a window seat for me. After some terrible experiences with other airlines (especially British Airways whose economy class has become a joke ever since they decided to divide their aircraft into five (!) different classes) this was an enjoyable experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-23;Flew to and from Sao Paulo via Frankfurt. Already written about the disastrous seat reservation system so I won't rant on about this here again. I would say though that it took no fewer than 4 people at Frankfurt to actually resolve our seating issues. In the end only the Flight Manager was able/willing/empowered to deal with it. The crew on all flights were to be fair very good and the food was fine too. Seats however were very uncomfortable on the B747 so I got little if any sleep on the long 11 hour flights. Also the IFE is terrible. I have a very varied and eclectic taste in TV music and film and found little to entertain me. And to top it all off Lufthansa left our bags in Frankfurt en route back to London and can't seem to drag themselves to get them back to us in Southampton until tomorrow even though by their own admission they have now arrived on a later flight. Appalling.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-21;LH491 January 10 2015. I have been a senator member for many years and since 1998 I flew practically only with this airline to my complete satisfaction. In the years I also became an hon club member thanks to my very frequent flight trips. Now I am retired person I cannot afford to fly business and I regularly fly 3-4 times a year either to Brazil or USA to visit my son and daughter. I always book well in advance my flights (the last one of December 16 2014 was booked on June 6 2014). To be more comfortable (I have a knee problem) I always try to book emergency seats and this seems to be almost impossible. I would like to see the airline more sensible to this subject.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-21;LH428 11/1/2015. Flight MUC to CLT with a small 330 / 300 Airbus. Flight was almost fully booked but plane was not parked at the gate but parked on the tarmac. Had to travel with busses. Plane was already delayed and extra de frosting made the delay even bigger. Entertainment system needed re booting several times. Crew were friendly. When you fly a lot like I do you expect a bit more variety of food - not always chicken with pasta.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-21;Flew Cologne to Munich and back on some day. Early morning flight was on time Crew were nice and offered chocolate cookies before take off. Flight only 50 minutes but got a nice coffee with milk and one juice. Captain informed about flight details. In Munich gate was with jetfinger and since the plane was not full it just took a few minutes to deplane. Love LH over Germanwings too bad they do not fly from Cologne to Hamburg.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-21;LH 428. Flight and connections were very good. I would improve entertainment on board (old movies) and food could be better! Overall they are good!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;Munich to Boston A330-300. New Business Class has finally arrived in most of the LH planes. In general I like the 180d-flat seat biggest drawback compared to other good business seats is the missing space for e.g. a laptop adjacent to the seat which superior seats from their other brands OS/LX offer you so you always have to use the foldaway table instead. Despite a fully booked C service was very efficient crew very attentive (and professional as always on LH). Entertainment screen is top of shelf. Plane was a little late and some people that had tight connection flights were fetched directly after arrival which is the efficiency LH is known for.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;Stockholm - Munich - Lisbon return. Everything worked out perfectly on this trip. The planes were in good condition the service was excellent and the food was better than expected. The short stop in the clean and efficient Munich airport was a nice break.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2015-01-19;Stockholm - Frankfurt - Dallas. This time the Lufthansa experience was not as impeccable as I am used to. On the long flight during the day from Frankfurt to Dallas the IFE system never started up. This made the journey feel a bit longer than the 10 hours it actually took. Apart from that the service the food and the comfort was very good. Without asking for it I was also offered a very generous amount of frequent flyer points as compensation a few weeks afterwards.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;FRA-SFO: First Class Terminal in Frankfurt is very elegant. Onboard service very good. Professional crew. Quality of food and drinks very high. The minus was the arrival at SFO: No separate lane for immigration. The bags from all passengers (it was an A380) came on one belt - totally chaotic.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;LAX-FRA LH457 7 Jan 2014 (LAX) and 8 Jan 2014 (FRA). I choose Lufthansa pretty often since I like their competence services flexibility regarding the luggage and their on-time flights. The aircraft's I have flown with were mostly in good to excellent conditions. There is often a good communication from the captain about the flight conditions and so on. Friendly and efficient staff. Sometimes fares could be a little expensive but it is easy to find interesting prices. I would definitely recommend this airline to everybody.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;LH 418 1/9/2015. Great service a beautiful new plane competent and friendly staff - had a wonderful experience going from FRA to IAD in the business cabin of a 747-8 on Lufthansa!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-19;Sao Paulo-Frankfurt in Premium Economy operated with a packed 748. Flight left late but made it perfectly on time. I always fly this route with Turkish Airlines in Comfort class (Premium Economy) but this time I decided to give Lufthansa and its new product a try. Seat: absolutely adequate and wide enough. There is plenty of room for your legs. It is ok for getting some sleep. I liked the amenity kit distributed. What I really did not like it's the absolute absence of privacy as the Premium Economy seats are actually not separated in any way from regular Economy class. Very good (and upgraded) IFE. The welcome drink despite very basic (juice) is a nice touch. Cabin crew as always with Lufthansa is efficient similing and polite. But let me spend some words on the food: almost inedible. It is actually the same food you would get in Economy class but served in china plates. Portion are getting every time smaller and food is almost tasteless. The price paid was quite high - overall not the best value for money. I'm afraid Lufthansa lost me on this route as I will keep flying Turkish Airlines Comfort class. Generally speaking Lufthansa remains a reliable airline.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;Vienna - Frankfurt - Buenos Aires (and back): Web check-in worked fine got my reserved seat in the rear of the B747-8. The feeding flight to Frankfurt was uneventful the small snack was okay I also like that you can have a beer on shorthaul flights. The walk to the departure gate was very long but that's not the fault of LH. Flight left Frankfurt on time but arrived late due to the very long flight time of 14 hours (resulting from bad weather over the Atlantic Ocean). Food was okay but less in quantity. I frankly do not understand why airlines cut costs by reducing the amount (and the quality) of food. At least you get alcoholic beverages. Entertainment is now great with a lot of movies/shows to select. I could also find some rest during this 14 hours flight. Unfortunately flight attendants did not make their rounds with beverages that often. Breakfast was very poor! Lufthansa is a reliable and professional airline they usually get you to your destination on time. But I am not really thrilled flying them.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;Basically uneventful flight. Relaxed and stress free boarding. Perfectly on time (both departure and arrival). However cabin staff (on my side of the aisle) was in training. (Hopefully). Forgot things full command of English or German deficient. Couldn't answer question on what the food is. All acceptable however not the lack of friendliness. That is unusual at in my experiences as frequent travelers with Lufthansa. (Senator/Gold status).;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;I have never felt more like cattle than on our trip FRA-HOUSTON on 1/6. Very crowded cabins with seats too close on the Airbus 380-800. Seats cannot be reserved ahead tried every way possible spent ages on it. Check-in online with actual access to seat map that allows you to chose your seat would make a lot of frequent flyers of all categories much happier. Flight attendants are overwhelmed with issues because of the random automatic system booking. Families are scattered all over the plane. Even after take off there were still people trying to reunite. This mess causes people to try frantically to reserve seats from 3 days before until past the door closures why in the world does Lufthansa want to have their personal overwhelmed with this problem is a mystery they lost my trust.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;JFK-Frankfurt-Budapest then Vienna-Munich-JFK. Tried to book seats online after booking flight but now Lufthansa only allows seats to be booked online by paying a fee (amount depending on the seat chosen) until 23 hours prior to the flight time when online booking of remaining seats is free. First aggravation. Start was delayed 2.5-3 hours due to late arrival of aircraft at JFK- no weather problems all other European flights left on time only this Lufthansa flight was late. The plane was a 747-8 not full had 3 seats for myself. Food not of high quality but the service throughout was exemplary - superb. Arriving in Frankfurt of course missing connecting flight to Budapest with a 4.5 wait for next flight. Asked Lufthansa in Frankfurt if I could have use of a lounge during the long wait and was outright denied that privilege though they gave me a 10 Euro certificate for something to eat in the meantime but as we had passed customs there were no restaurants available in that area only snack bars so had a torte. Flight to Budapest was routine sandwich and drinks. Luggage arrived timely in Budapest. Return to JFK with short flight Vienna to Munich (drinks but no snacks) - then Airbus 330 Munich to JFK which was quite cramped as to seating even on the aisle. Food barely passed muster (metal cutlery though) as Lufthansa has declined dramatically in their culinary department but again the Flight attendants were magnificent many drink runs and staff courtesy and organization superior to both Swissair and Austrian flown on similar routes in the last months (Austrian has the best food of the 3 airlines but being owned now by Lufthansa that too has declined considerably from a few years ago). The new 747-8 had a quieter flight than most other planes flying transatlantically. Without the inability to book seats earlier than 23 hours before each flight and the very late departure of the flight to Frankfurt from JFK I would rank Lufthansa higher than a 3 - probably an 8 despite uninteresting bland meals.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;This was my return flight from Paris CDG to DOH via FRA in Business Class the flight from CDG to FRA was on an Airbus A321 was comfortable with prompt efficient service all on time though I was troubled that at check in although I explained to the staff that I had fragile glass ornaments but they refused to put a handle with care stickers on my bags. The portion from Frankfurt to Doha was on an Airbus A330 with the new business class which was very nice and excellent service with wonderful meal selection I really liked the Bavarian Goose. Though the connection time was very short just one hour but all our bags made it through which was also very nice.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-14;Trip from Frankfurt to Dublin in Business Class on A319 (no connecting flight). You get what you expect. The weak point is the seating of NEK as its an Economy Class Seat with the middle-Seat blocked. Seat pitch and space are not luxury the recline is ridiculous and it feels somewhat cheap. There is no IFE and no power socket what was not so important on this 110 minutes flight. Nevertheless I would spend the money again as the rest was really ok.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-11;LH772 FRA-BKK with A340-300 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that. LH seats seems to be bigger than in the past a little bit harder but more spacious in length. The inflight entertainment is excellent with touch screen 8' monitor quite good quality. The only complain is that it shows the program of December 2014 even we started the trip on the first 2015. The steward promised to check and answer but he never returned.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-11;LH779 SIN-FRA with A380 window seat 23 K. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. The C class seat near the window got extra storage on the side and is very convenience. The only problem is the remote control under your arm rest some times you unintentionally hit the remote control and your film stops. I like the A380 very much.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-11;I flew Venice-Frankfurt-Delhi on December 28. Initial flight was supposed to be a day earlier so I missed my connection in FRA and was put on a Lufthansa flight to Delhi rather than Air India which was nice. VCE-FRA was delayed by 2hours and I only managed to make it because FRA-DEL was also delayed. FRA airport although I was there for less than an hour was an atrocious experience. I had to speed like crazy to make the flight and still had to go through security one more time and they were extremely rude unprofessional and in no way understanding. This is surely not Lufthansa's fault but it did ruin my trip. Flight to Delhi was on their A380 which I adore. Leg room was fair food was decent although they only had vegetarian options. FAs were extremely polite and professional and always asked if we wanted any drinks throughout the flight. My issue was mostly related to IFE which was not what I expected from LH. Overly German focused and pretty dull overall. Regardless I surely would fly them again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-11;I flew on the new 747-8 that Lufthansa put into service from LAX to Frankfurt. The cabin was clean and the entertainment system functioned flawlessly. I was seated in coach somewhat in the middle section. The service was prompt and pleasant. Although I don't eat airline food the cabin crew completed service and quickly quietly cleaned it up. The aircraft itself was quiet and the lighting system was much more pleasant (L.E.D.) than the standard type. Overall better than many other transatlantic flights I've made.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-05;LH1392M Frankfurt - Prague. On time departure bussed to aircraft on remote stand. Efficient and friendly crew and a lovely breakfast served despite the flight being only 40 minutes.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-05;Tried to book seats online for our impending journey to Brazil. Spent an age going through all the information and was poised to spend a small fortune on allocated seats and then found I started getting spurious (but in no way informative) error messages referring me to a (German) telephone number. I decided after several attempts to use the Lufthansa webchat and a nice but not very helpful woman took me all the way through the very laborious process only to inform me after all that their website is not compatible with Google Chrome. So my Sister tried it for me on her PC and it failed yet again. Half the population uses Google Chrome! Lufthansa you really need yo try harder than this. Appalling start to our first ever Lufthansa experience. I am rating the airline on the various categories listed here as it won't let me submit a review without doing so.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2015-01-05;FRA-DTW and DTW-FRA LH 442 and LH 443. Food: It would be great to have the availability of both food choices when sitting at the back of the plane. I'm sure the person sitting in the first rows of economy class didn't pay more than the person in the back and should have the availability to choose between foods. Seat Comfort: The seatmap shown during the self check-in was not the same as found on the plane. In the seatmap during check-in it was shown that there was no other seat to my right. I ended up sitting in the middle seat.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;Lufthansa is getting tired and it shows. I have flown 73 times with Lufthansa in the last 7 years. My flights BEG - FRA - ADDIS (via Jeddah) and return business class were very disappointing. Frankfurt - Addis is a long flight. Old aircraft old tilting seats old films old system unimaginative food no difference on the way back. Crew change in Jeddah swapped one good cheery crew for another.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;I had the flight Paris-Tirana-Paris via Munich last month. Lufthansa offers very good European product. Both flights arrived on time and Lufthansa provides nice clean aircraft's with very friendly cabin crew. I am very much pleased with the generous leg room in comparison with low cost companies. This is very much appreciated! In terms of the food I have only one comment since Lufthansa gives sandwiches which used to be very tasty. Now they gave us the cheese sandwich which was full of unidentified cream and mayonnaise. It was so stodgy and unpleasant. I hope that the management will make appropriate actions to distribute healthy simple food in the future. Overall Lufthansa is my first choice and it is recommended without hesitation for European routes.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;I felt disappointed on my flight back from Toronto to Frankfurt in August. At the check-in counter I paid an extra fee since my bag was heavier but that was no problem. I asked if I could bring another hand-baggage but the answer was no. I felt ripped off when boarding I saw people with 3-4 bags each one when allowed is 1. And moreover I couldn't put my bag over me but 5-10 meters behind me since there was no place where it was supposed to be because a young couple had 2 backpacks 2 bags and 2 sleeping bags. I spent 1000$ dollars and 150$ more for the fee and I had my worst flight because I was so pissed off. And at the airport I had to take the money at the atm paying commissions because the credit card machine didn't work.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;I like Lufthansa but increasingly flying through Frankfurt is becoming a nightmare. More often than not the plane is parked on the tarmac vs. at a gate and there are inordinate delays as the busses don't leave till they are absolutely full - if you are travelling first or business and have got off first or had priority boarding - it really makes no difference as you end up waiting in the bus. Also the amount of time that it takes to transfer gates during transit and also go through immigration make it easily one of the worse international hubs now.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;ARN-MUC 17 Dec one-way. Full flight on a A320. Service was a bit rushed. Everything was commenced in the first 20 minutes and then nothing only if you ask for it. A small sandwich was served and drinks. Crew were friendly and nice. A standard intra-european flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;Flight LH475 from Montreal to Munich on 12/12/2014. A bit delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft from Munich however the delay was almost made up in Munich what allowed me to catch the connecting flight. Appreciate the upgrade to Business Class as Gold Star Alliance member - service great as usual no any problems. Recommend LH for long haul flights - even in the Economy Class the seat is quite comfortable and passenger safety and satisfaction is always of top priority.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;December 2 2014 from Dulles flight 419. Destination was Frankfurt Germany. Upgraded on the return flight which was Frankfurt to Dulles on Lufthansa 418 on December 13 2014. Lufthansa has always been our preferred carrier but the new seating in economy was on the verge of intolerable. The way the seat attaches to the floor greatly limits what you can carry on there is no foot room. Knee room to the next row is minimal especially if the person in the seat in front leans back. The seats are narrow and not comfortable. They are squeezed together so much that the seat pocket in front of you can barely hold one bottle of water. Food has greatly degraded over the past few years. I feel degraded by being in economy class. It is insulting to pay for such a horribly uncomfortable trip. I felt like baggage being crammed into the baggage hold and that I had no value as a customer. Our return flight was much better as we unhappily upgraded to economy plus but we greatly resented being forced to pay more money just to have a seat that was adequate for an overseas flight.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;Flight Munich - Washington (LH414). Great seat big TV screen modern and easy to use controls nice materials everywhere. The seat was comfortable and roomy (I was in the window seat). Entertainment was good. Food was also good and a fair choice. Plenty of beverages. Crew was wonderful flight attendants were attentive and friendly. The only thing I would recommend - some more privacy. But overall I had a very good experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;LH491 LH431. Whenever we fly between Germany and the US we fly Lufthansa. The seat comfort in Economy class seats is a pain. Business or First Class I can recommend without hesitation. The service is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! We had the seats at the emergency exit which we take if we have to fly Economy as Senator without extra charge as a standard passenger with extra charge. The space you have in this seat is limited the only plus is the leg room but people who try to go to the bathroom step into it hit your legs etc. Wondering why there is no Economy Plus as an option.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-31;Flight LH444 from FRA to ATL booked in ECO because our company travel policy does not allow Business but operational upgrade to C (based on my status as LH-Senastor) because the main cabine was full and C not even 50 % occupied. Plane was equipped with the new business class seats I like them very much. The food was excellent and the wine selection very nice. All in all I had a very relaxed flight and arrived in Atlanta right on time.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;Flight LH797 (Dec 11 2014) from Hong Kong to Frankfurt in economy class I don't have a frequent flyer status (yet) however I try to be loyal to one company. New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can! Hostesses not attentive in general. In the future I will rather fly with Lufthansa's sister company Swiss Airlines which I personally find of a much better service.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;LH 419: I really enjoy traveling with Lufthansa for business I travel first or business class with my family we normally travel economy class. I really must say that I get the impression that economy is getting tighter with the years. The airlines offer much more space. Business and first I can recommend without hesitation.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;I flew LH 419 on Dec 4th from Washington DC to Frankfurt Germany. The seats in the first class cabin were excellent. The service was excellent and the meal including the wine choices were superb. It is easier to get some sleep with the flat bed seats. I have traveled extensively with Lufthansa since 1991.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;LH491. Airline and its service were very good for the price paid. Aircraft was renewed in economy (seats TV) which was very good. Food comparable to other European carriers.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;Paid for a full priced business flight from Frankfurt to Cairo and got stuck on a plane with economy seats no inflight entertainment whatsoever (I'm giving it one star because there's no option for zero no magazines except for Newsweek and Time no English language newspapers in short I will be avoiding Lufthansa in the future! Even if they downsize for any particular reason on a route without giving the discount why not have iPads with movies?;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;I adore Lufthansa's short-haul business class product. On this short 90 min flight from Munich to Amsterdam onboard an Embraer E90 the service was friendly yet professional the seat very comfortable and the food superb! The presentation is sophisticated and the quality excellent.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;Flight LH 490 from Frankfurt to Seattle Dec/5th/2014. The First Class lounge was a very good a first class service in full - reception attendants and attention breakfast food seating space for working Wi-Fi. Passport control was taken care and being driven to the gate was a nice touch. Inflight very relaxing courteous attendants continued and food were really first class quality and quantity wise. Flight entertainment could be slight better real bed was excellent working room as well. Maybe bigger pillows would complement. All in all excellent first class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;Had 2 flights MAN-MUC-RUH on 13th December 2014. First flight was LH-2501 from Manchester to Munich in an Airbus A321. No entertainment screens but this was only a two hour flight so I didn't mind. However the staff service was excellent and I got served a decent sandwich plus coffee and coke. Seats were okay for the short flight. Transferred at Munich Airport which was very neat and clean with a good bus ride from the plane to the terminal. The next flight LH-608 from Munich to Riyadh in an Airbus A330 (five hours) was the real deal! Seats weren't exactly the most comfortable out of all planes I've been on but it was good enough! Entertainment screens were quite unresponsive and not much of my interest but I have my iPod so I didn't mind. Managed to watch 2 episodes of Big Bang Theory and my sister watched Harry Potter (she was really happy that there were 5 Harry Potter movies available on the flight). Again excellent staff service (they smiled a lot for an added bonus) and I was surprised to get a really tasty meal (with Halal meat). Really well done for a non-middle-eastern airline! I felt completely relaxed throughout the flight!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;LH 997 AMS-FRA service was much better compared to other European airlines on a short flight. Snack was served and drinks offered two times. Crew very professional and helpful. Flight was on time and it seems that Lufthansa improved considerably after some criticisms published 2 years ago.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;LH431. Whenever I fly between Germany and the US I try to fly Lufthansa. Even if one feels that Lufthansa cuts cost it is still better than flying one of the American airlines who typically use old airplanes don't even offer wine or beer any longer and have terrible food. Lufthansa finally uses upgraded planes between Chicago and Frankfurt which they didn't for quite a while (no idea why). However the seat comfort (no lumbar support at all) and especially the space between Economy class seats definitely declined or respectively shrunk within the last 7 years. It's a pain to get into these Economy class seats if one is just little bit taller not to mention having a careless passenger upfront of you who rams his seat into your knees without hesitation. The service at Lufthansa is always excellent and I always enjoyed that! Also the food is good and they still offer wine and beer.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-22;I flew LH 419 on Dec 4th from Washington DC to Frankfurt Germany. The seats in the first class cabin were excellent. The service was excellent and the meal including the wine choices were superb. It is easier to get some sleep with the flat bed seats. I have traveled extensively with Lufthansa since 1991.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-12-18;Oslo-Munich-Berlin / Berlin-Frankfurt-Oslo. Convenient schedules good and efficient service almost throughout. It was worth the premium over flying with another company. The boarding at Munich was the only thing that could have been better - the flight was delayed by about 30 minutes and boarding was somewhat chaotic. Definitely looking forward to my next Lufthansa flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-18;LH456. Had the opportunity to fly LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles in Economy (normally I fly business). Was impressed by the overall high standard (the new B-747 I guess) and inflight entertainment is top of the tops. Small disappointment in food and beverage: Food: overall quality good chicken run out two rows before us so pasta only choice. In addition I do not understand why proper bread is not served instead of this white thing that resembles bad quality (Germany has good bread) Beverage: fail to understand why you get 2nd rate prosecco / sparkling and wines. Furthermore non-alcoholic beer was not available on flight. That is cost-saving on the wrong level in my opinion.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;STR-FRA-GIG and GRU-MUC (business) -STR. STR-FRA very long bus transport from parking area to terminal. Long walk in FRA to terminal C nice lounge for waiting until boarding. Flight to GIG on 744 acceptable seating comfort. Food and drink offered were ok for economy. GRU-MUC on A346 in Business good food good service seat not that comfortable this time - still some hours of rest. IFE some nice films but very limited selection. Final leg MUC-STR very limited space in overhead bins - not even room for my hand luggage backpack. Luggage arrived one day later as it hadn't made connection in GRU.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;The 747-800 is my favourite plane in the Lufthansa fleet for it has their new lie-flat business class seat which was much appreciated on this 13 hour flight from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt. However I was very angry that the IFE did not work in my seat. Despite three attempts to reset it. Kaput! Not exactly satisfying when you pay premium $$ for a seat on a long-haul flight. The onboard wifi was also broken. I do have to say though that the purser came to apologize to me and she did a great job in explaining the situation re all the technical difficulties. Was appreciated. The food presentation and choices were excellent despite the flight attendants' initial insistence on speaking German to me even when I repeatedly asked them a question in English. Liked flight info and map.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;Chennai to FRA. It was a old 747 flight the IFE screen was very small and useless no touch screen. There was no great selection of movies unless you know German. I wish I carried iPad. The FA's were rude not interested in customer service. For the 10 hour flight from Chennai to Frankfurt first 8 hours they serve nothing other then two rounds of juice. Just before landing a small light breakfast. Seats were cramped. I was disappointed with LH and will not fly again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;Unfortunately the crew on this flight was neither very friendly nor attentive. One of the stewards didn't want to talk he just indicated questions by nodding. The flight was not completely full but the crew seemed to be strained - maybe due to problems with the entertainment system - so that they only seemed to care for the guest who couldn't use the entertainment. I am used to a much better service provided by Lufthansa - my last flight to NY in September this year for example was one of the best flights I ever experienced - the crew was very attentive the purser introduced herself to me and offered me another seat. They even brought me food from the business class. I'm not expecting this for every flight but I expect the crew to be friendly and attentive.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;LAX/FRA/LAX. 1 of 11 Lufthansa flights in the last 18 months. Some of which were affected by their relentless strikes. I found it to be hit or miss depending on cabin crew. The planes are always clean but never comfortable. The food is always there but can be an insult to taste buds. My last flight was cancelled due to them having a pilot strike. Didn't get that message until a day after which by then was irrelevant. I went to a Lufthansa counter at Cologne airport to get help. Their helpline was hopelessly backed up. The flight crew on both legs of my trip seemed arrogant and unresponsive. I missed the beverage service as I was looking out the window - the flight attendant was one row forward by the time I noticed her and simply ignored my attempts to get her attention. They charge legacy rates for substandard service. I will more than likely shop for other airlines for future trips making sure it isn't a Lufthansa code share.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-10;LH 465 from Orlando to Frankfurt on Nov 9th 2014. Despite their marketing campaign on many Lufthansa flights to the US and elsewhere there are still the old business class seats installed. I was on the Orlando - Frankfurt flight. Those seats are not good. Hard not good for sleeping not 180 degree flat but an inclined S form. Other airlines offer a much better business class for less money and on my next US flight I will definitely choose another airline if I find out that the airplane has the old seats. Lufthansa tickets in business class are generally high priced. so I would expect 180 degree seats. Service staff though is very well trained professional and food quality is good.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-04;LH410 from Munich to JFK on October 10 2014. Everything worked as expected. The flight was on time both for departure and landing. Check-in security boarding as well as disembarkation and baggage retrieval worked without a hitch. On-board service was competent and caring. No complaints at all for Economy Class you can't do much better than that.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-04;LHR-MUC-LHR. A321 both ways. LH2479 and LH2470. Outbound was very full. So much so I had to put my weekend hand luggage under the seat in front. Crew where friendly and professional. Inbound less busy. Leg room was sufficient for a short flight and the snack and drink was fresh. On time departure inbound but we were bussed from the jet to the terminal at LHR.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-01;SFO-FRA on 28 October on a 380 in the Business Class torture seats. Good flight otherwise but neither my wife or I could get any sleep in these horrible seats.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-12-01;Flight FRA-CAI in business class. It was the worst travel I've ever done. The airplane was a A320 but seats in business class were like economy and considering this is a 4 hours flight this not good. No IFE on board neither shared screens or PTV. I wouldn't recommend LH for these medium haul routes.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-25;Flight from San Francisco to Frankfurt on AB A380 aircraft clean food OK staff OK. Seat lousy - no legroom and uncomfortable. Armrest on aisle seat would not lower making it hard to leave the seat. Staff didn't know how to fix the problem. In-flight entertainment system next to useless because of unresponsive touch screen and one audio channel not working. Aircraft temperature cold to the point of requiring a jacket be worn at all times. On connecting flight to Berlin Luft. gate staff did not announce gate change in English so confusion resulted among waiting passengers who didn't speak German or missed the change on the electronic screen. Flight from Munich to San Francisco on AB A340 departed late because of baggage handling problem. Aircraft clean but temperature again cold and seat comfort worse than A380. In flight entertainment center barely working because of slow finicky touch screen and static in audio. Food OK not good just OK. Before taking Luft. again I will be sure to shop around for a better choice even if it means paying more.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-25;Munich to Chicago 19 Nov 2014 flight 434. Lufthansa is efficient and I always prefer flying Lufthansa. Airline staff are generally courteous. Seat comfort and space are excellent. Inflight movie selection was a bit uninteresting. One slight problem I paid extra for aisle exit seats but did not receive these on the return flight likely because I was forced to accept a flight change after the initial ticket was bought.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-20;"I flew Mumbai to Boston in mid October 2014. What a massive disappointment - legroom worse than Spicejet I am over 6 Ft tall I travelled all the way with my knees resting on the back of the seat in front. Staff not particularly friendly. They don't serve water at the seat - when I asked for water I was told to go and serve myself in the galley. In Frankfurt my flight to Boston was displaying on the screens but no gate indicated for a long time. I approached a member of staff to ask and was told ""I am not the Information counter"". What kind of customer service does Lufthansa think it is providing? The return flight to India was not much different. I have vowed to never to fly this airline.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-20;"As LH Senator I have repeatedly booked a seat for my flights and repeatedly the seat reservation was cancelled. The seat booking system is not working at all. Estimate 75% of cases the seat cancellation is performed without any background - it is very disappointing. Flight LH2023 is a classical example of another incomprehensible situation - nearly every day the ""business class"" (which in LH's case is nothing but economy divided by curtain from the rest of the plane) is extended till row 12 making 48 business seats while occupation is 3 - 5 ""business"" passengers. Remaining travellers are squeezed in the back while front section is entirely empty. Another trick is to extend the ""business class"" for 24 hours to row 19 remove all forward seats reservations and then return back to the original configuration. Why they do it is a mystery to me. LH obviously don't like their status customers in the front of the aircraft.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-20;"LH471 YYZ to FRA en route to Marrakech. Usual LH experience: on time departure and arrival clean and orderly aircraft competent and polite cabin crew mediocre entertainment selection. Sadly the usual LH experience in seating as well. When is the ""old"" Business Class seat going to disappear? Probably the most uncomfortable C class seating I encounter.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-20;Flew MAN-MUC-DEL return in Business Class. Lounge in MAN is ok - typical regional airport lounge. Warm croissants. Breakfast on flight was ok - had ordered Asian veg. Service good. The long haul was a pleasant surprise. I'm 6ft tall and managed to get zero sleep on a flight to Mumbai from Frankfurt 7 years ago and that was my last flight with LH. The new Business class was a pleasant surprise. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Amenity kit is good. The seats are a huge improvement on the sloping beds. I managed to get a few hours sleep too. If you sit by the window you may find it a bit cramped. I switched to an aisle on the way back and this wasn't so cramped. Will use them again for Delhi especially s the flights tend to get in earlier than most other carriers. Lufthansa served 2 full meals on this flight which is impressive. Lufthansa need to realise that paneer (Indian Cheese) covered in Indian gravy for both meals wont escape the attention of the least sober passenger. As I wasn't interested in the food I forgive them. Will fly LH again for value and comfort.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-20;I have to report an excellent journey JNB-FRA-LCY. New refurbished Business cabin on the A380 is very comfortable and a lovely decent sized pillow on which to sleep. Lie flat seat/bed is good but could be a bit narrow at shoulder level. However I managed 5-6 hrs sleep which is unusual for me on a lon flight. Food delicious especially on my outbound FRA-JNB sector Roast Goose which was perfect! Crew on all sectors were friendly and professional and the transit through FRA was a breeze. I would advise people to choose seats at rear of the 380 upper deck pref. row 26/27 as LH serve their food from the rear moving forward so you'll always have a full menu choice if seated here. A lovely travelling experience with an airline that maintains its pedigree.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-11-17;Regular LH410 flight good food and inflight entertainment as usual only problem was the freezing temperature onboard. Staff tried to increase it during the flight unsuccessfully.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-12;Good airline with good service and modern planes. Unfortunately not all planes have new seats but the new seats make a real difference! Fortunately the Washington - Munich flight had the new equipment. Food and drink offer is very good if not exceptional.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-12;Flight from FRA-IST. Cabin crew service is okay for a European carrier. Smiling faces welcomes you on boarding until the end of the flight. Very attentive and skilled. Seating and entertainment not the best still bearable for a short flight but can't imagine these standards for +5 hours. Lunch provided was delicious however not many choices on offer. Overall a good flight with only minor draw backs.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-12;Oct 19 LH783 a group of us travelled to France in transit at Frankfurt Airport. Our confirmed seatings were all messed up despite we have booked this in Feb 14. It took us 40 minutes at KLIA Lufthansa counter to sort this out - each couple were seated together but the group had to split up. On our return leg (7 Nov 14) our group confirmed seats were again messed up despite reconfirming the seat 3 days before our departure with Lufthansa Malaysia. The check in counter staff was not helpful nor friendly at CDG airport to help us to reassign our seats so that each couple could sit together but the group was split up again. The return flight (Paris to Frankfurt LH1043) was re-timed later by 20 minutes but we were not informed and the flight arrived late at Frankfurt. So we had to run for our connecting flight to KL. There were no Lufthansa Staff at the gate to provide assistance.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-11;LHR-FRA-JNB in economy. Short flight from London to Frankfurt satisfactory with good snack and drink pleasant attendants. Transfer at Frankfurt seamless to the A380 to Johannesburg - gone are the days of long walks through the lengthy corridors of Frankfurt. Very comfortable seats and service on A380. Cabin crew very responsive and friendly. Food satisfactory. Return was CPT-MUC-LHR. A340-600 from Cape Town - plane not crowded so good service again with satisfactory food and drinks. Attendants served beverages throughout the night. Seats were comfortable all round. Minimal fuss and no problems with delays - all flights on time. Very good long haul flight. Short hop from Munich to London was good as well with breakfast snack served just right for this length. IFE can have more up to date movies and music but small price to sacrifice.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-11;I traveled with my family on LH 768 from FRA to PNQ on 7th November 2014. It was a really good travel experience for us. Very comfortable and convenient too. Seats are comfortable same as any other regular Lufthansa flights. Landing at Pune for Puneites is far better than to Mumbai saving a lot of time in immigration process and travelling from Mumbai to Pune. Its really great to fly direct to Pune from Europe and credit to Lufthansa and PrivatAir.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-06;Flight LH491 - really bad seats. TV box under the seat. No room for legs (I'm 185cm tall) TV selection was poor. Touch screen hardly worked. Sound was awful and flickering monitor.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-06;Impossibly thin seat and insufficient legroom and this was a long flight (Philadelphia to Frankfurt). Very poor food even by economy standards. Inflight entertainment system did not work well choice of classical music weighted towards modern composers. The only saving grace was the cabin crew. Lufthansa used to be a good airline but these days it's more like a discounter charging legacy prices. Avoid it if you can.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-06;Very happy with our first class flights. The first class lounge in Munich was very pleasant with the usual high quality food offerings. The food onboard was good when traveling from Boston to Munich on 10/17 and outstanding on the way back - Munich to Boston on 10/26. Service also very good Boston-Munich and absolutely outstanding on the Munich-Boston flight. The flight attendant on the Munich-Boston flight was fast efficient and very pleasant. Entertainment was OK we both care more for recent movies than the latest releases but I understand it's difficult to please everyone. I'd say that the Wi-Fi should be free in first class. The Munich-Prague and Prague-Munich segments in business class were pretty much standard the Munich-Prague flight was quite delayed fortunately for us the Prague-Munich flight was on time. All in all a pleasant experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-03;Travelling from Frankfurt to London-City. Fast boarding procedure and arriving on time. The sandwich on board was really tasty and a decent snack on this one hour flight. The friendly flight attendants completed this pleasant journey.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-03;IAD (Washington Dulles) to MUC (Munich Germany) LH 415 Oct 5 2014. Seat comfort: The aircraft was an A330-300. I had a window seat. Foot space was ridiculously small as two metal boxes of about 10 cm width each were fixed to the legs of the seat in front of me. Every window seat seemed to have that feature. This makes a long haul flight very uncomfortable. Inflight entertainment: The touch screen took ages to react or was so sensitive or insensitive that I never knew whether I had pressed it correctly or not. The rest was fine.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-11-03;Flight out of Krakow to Munich cancelled due to heavy fog. Lufthansa in Krakow put us up in hotel for night with vouchers for meals. Lufthansa staff at Krakow were great cannot say the same for the staff in Germany! Re-booked next day to Munich one hour layover then home to Chicago. Flight next afternoon was late due to incoming plane being late. Thus our one hour window to connect was becoming smaller. Announcements on plane about other connections but none regarding Chicago. I asked a flight attendant before we landed and she said she knew nothing. We arrived late in Munich So the 2 of us and 3 other passengers missed our connecting flight to Chicago by minutes! No one at gate in Munich to assist us. Finally directed to service center where we waited almost an hour to be re-booked. Re-booked to Frankfurt that night where we would be given hotel vouchers then on to Chicago the next day. When we boarded short flight to Frankfurt the pilot made an announcement that we would be delayed because we were waiting for 7 passengers who were connecting! In Munich we told rep we wanted to pick up our luggage in Frankfurt. Arriving in Frankfurt we had to go to Service center again to get our hotel and meal vouchers. He directed us to belt 16 Baggage claim B to get our luggage. We got there no luggage! Talked to lady at baggage tracing and she told us the bags arrived at A and since no one was there to claim them they were in a holding cell. She finally made a call and within 10 minutes our bags were there. Frankfurt airport is huge and Lufthansa agents were few and far between no one seemed to know anything. Classic case of the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The clincher is when we boarded our flight to Chicago the next day we were delayed because a family was detained in immigration! What happened to not being able to hold the plane? Horrible service. Unless Lufthansa is the only airline flying to where I am traveling I am not using them again. No one seemed to know and much less care.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-31;Took flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto on October 23 2014. Flight was 1 hour delayed departure as well as arrival. Plane was technically up-to-date. On-board personnel and service was satisfactory. All equipment worked without fail. Seats were reasonably comfortable and provided satisfactory space. Entertainment program provided wide range of choices. All-in-all good flight despite the delay.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-31;I am a Lufthansa frequent customer and I have always enjoyed their service and timetable. My flight experience from YUL to MUC left me with a bit of mixed feelings. Even though the flight is not that long approx. 7 hrs the plane was fully packed with people and the seats were really uncomfortable. It was not possible to move around and not even sleep. Furthermore the passenger in front of me considered her right to keep her seat not in the fully upright position during the entire flight leaving me with very limited space. And when I asked the flight attendants to tell her to bring her seat a bit further up so as to have some space myself I was taken by surprise to hear that they could not wake her up and that I should simply do the same or change seat (I seat that I had pre-selected and paid). Maybe Lufthansa needs to reconsider the number of passengers and luggage allowed for long- haul flights and not treat passengers as commodities to that respect.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-31;"FRA-BRE-FRA last weekend. Outbound was really good. Cabin Crew very friendly. Always had a smile on their face. Service was very good. They served a cold breakfast which was very good. The way back to FRA was more or less OK. Was not that friendly. What annoyed me was that there were 3 flight attendants as ""Business Class Passengers"" seated. Not my thing at all that staff flies business class and chit chat all the way loudly. Sorry folks of LH but keep things a bit down especially when you have paying business class passengers on flights. Seat them either in the back close to the galley or on a jump seat when the flight is full. I recommend this airline because the way to BRE they did go the extra mile.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-31;MEX-FRA with B747-8 new business class seat. On time flight and friendly crews. New seat was comfortable however if you have a window seat you need to stride over an aisle seat passenger on the relax/sleeping position. Meals were quite simple no good nor bad. No impression and just snacks sandwiches were served between meal times. BOSE noise cancelling headphone worked quite good. New Entertainment system for 747-8 was excellent. USB port didn't work. AC power outlet worked.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-31;MUC-JFK flight LH410. Good on board service. Economy seats really to small for a continental 9 hours flight (central row one of the last in the rear of plane). If you want to choose your seat during booking or before check-in you will be charged an additional fee.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-28;Short hop FRA-DUB on A321. Check in and cabin crew friendly. Decent snack served on this 2 hr flight. Departed on time and arrived early. The slimline seat provided extra legroom and was OK for this length flight but may be a bit hard if the sector is longer. Very happy to use again at least on European sectors.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-28;Flight LH495. I flew from Munich to Toronto. The flight was very relaxing with excellent service and food. I arrived to some extent relaxed despite of the long trip.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-22;Manchester-Chisinau via Munich. Initial outward flight delayed due to crew 'being stuck in traffic' although all passengers were waiting at the gate on time (it was a full flight). Standard of slimline seating on Lufthansa flights not comfortable at all (way too hard even for relatively short flights). Cabin crew pleasant and drinks / snacks ok. On return journey Lufthansa had another delayed flight back to Manchester with plenty of seats still available that would have got me home much earlier than my booked flight but their 'customer service' staff in Munich wouldn't entertain allowing me on it that would be far too helpful for them. All in all nothing special for the price far too inflexible / not focussed on customers and I'll avoid Lufthansa in future for that reason.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-22;I recently flew on Luthansa Flight LH414 (Munich to Washington D.C.). Plane was good but the service was marginal. Flight service was very rushed. One got the impression that they wanted to get everything done quickly so that they could sit in the back and talk which this is what they did. I sat in the last row of the plane.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-22;Flew with a A330 from Munich to NYC (JFK airport). It was a pleasant trip. Comfortable seats nice and very helpful flight attendants. Unlike e.g. British Airways which I have used for my last two trips to North America the catering on board was great. Additional water or juice e.g. was served regularly. The snack before landing consisted of Weißwurst Pralinen and a Laugenbrötchen which was very delicious. I asked for an extra portion which I got without any hesitation. They would have thrown away any leftover food anyway so I thought eating another portion would be better as it was extremely good. The only downside to the flight was that the aircraft engines are quite loud compared to other aircraft's. Also the choice of films could have been better. Overall I was very satisfied.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-22;LH494 MUC-YYZ. Airbus A330-300 (333) V1 (re-vamped interior with the new LH biz class seats) seated in eco emergency row 30 window seat pair. Status customer with LH (senator) travelling with partner. Ground service (baggage drop-off lounge etc.) seamless as always. Sky service attentive quick quiet very professional little kids of other passengers and elderly passengers all taken care of with help. Sky catering as good as you can expect in eco little treats added to the overall good level. New version of LH safety script at taxiing is much improved easy-to-understand delivered at the right slow pace w/o becoming dragging and boring. Also no bothering bold music during take-off/landing times as with some other *A carriers. Overall LH manifests that they are of course not the cheapest but they quietly excel in numerous details by those few percent compared to others. You just feel that little bit less worn after an LH eco long-haul as you might do after one with other carriers.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-22;Excellent lounge at IAD with pre-flight meals. Direct boarding of the aircraft from there. Unobtrusive friendly service. Excellent sleeping comfort in the first class cabin.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-20;Just off LH2051 TXL-MUC. Probably ranks as one of the worst flights ever - no welcome onboard plane totally full however no help from crew in stowing luggage - busy chatting among themselves. Pilot eventually told us they would delay the flight if we did not manage to stow baggage ourselves. Rude and snotty service inflight with no smiles. Seats uncomfortable and too short. In addition to that all flight delayed as usual. LH is going downhill.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;FRA-LAX and return. New business class is very comfortable and Lufthansa crew is always friendly. Food was also good generous portions and very varied. Only downside on LH is the entertainment system. They could add more recent movies to their list.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;Flight LH 409 Newark to Dusseldorf in September. Flight was operated by an older A340-300 which was in very good condition and had nice inflight entertainment on big personal screens (much better than on Lufthansa's A330s at the moment). IFE featured loads of movies and fancy stuff such as real time speed / altitude. Flight departed about 1 hour late. Nevertheless I could easily catch my connection to Vienna. Food was alright could have been a little more though. Drinks were always available. Cabin crew did a great job very friendly and professional. Seat comfort was good for Economy Class enough legroom and I like the 2-4-2 seating. Changing in Dusseldorf was very convenient (small distances and a nice airport). I'm usually very satisfied with Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;BHX to Munich via Frankfurt and Munich to Birmingham inbound. Could not fault the flights I had with them. Service was very good and cabin crew attentive. Travelled with two friends for the Oktoberfest who were both 6ft 6in and I am below 6 ft. Both of my tall friends had no complaints with the legroom. Baggage arrived on time. All in all flights had been hassle-free. Only downside is lack of entertainment but for a short flight it was barely noticeable. Will definitely fly with them again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;FRA-JFK 747-8 in First Class. Truly First Class experience all the way from the exclusive feel of the FCT at Frankfurt limo to the plane and then a very warm and professional welcome from the fantastic crew. Cabin 7/8 full. Seats 1A and 1K are great for people traveling together although not the most private. Beautifully elegant cabin comfortable seat/bed and simply wonderful service. Only the food was disappointing - nothing special and poorly presented. Excellent wines. Bags first off at JFK and off the plane and through Customs within 20 minutes! Would definitely fly again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;FRA-LAX and return. New business class is very comfortable and Lufthansa crew is always friendly. Food was also good generous portions and very varied. Only downside on LH is the entertainment system. They could add more recent movies to their list.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;My wife flew on 10/6/2014 from Newark NJ on Flight LH 403 to Frankfurt and from Frankfurt to Chennai India on Lufthansa LH758. For health reasons my wife needs a wheelchair as she has trouble walking. We requested a wheelchair for her at the Newark Frankfurt and Chennai airports. Everything was fine in Newark NJ. However when she arrived at Frankfurt no wheelchair was provided. Lufthansa staff advised her there was no wheelchair and to walk slowly. When my wife told them she can hardly walk and carry the carry-on luggage they ignored her. Finally one Lufthansa staff walked her to the bus to the next flights terminal but she did not help in any way. Seeing my wife’s inability to move the carry-on another kind passenger helped her. When she arrived at her terminal she had to wait for the cart to drive her to her gate. Lufthansa staff needs to be trained in customer service especially service to individuals who need assistance. These flights are not inexpensive and there is no excuse for this type of rude and incompetent service.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-12;3 of 4 flight segments this year have all been delayed. The last one being this morning from BCN-FRA over 30 minutes late. On the outbound FRA-BCN economy passengers were served half of a sandwich. That's how far LH has sunk now.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-08;Flight 427 PHL to Frankfurt on August 23 2014. This flight was supposed to have new business class. The video was non-functional and my seat would not operate properly. We were in 4A and 4C. At the end of the flight the flight attendant found a large water bottle in the mechanism inside the seat cushion. Headphones were loose attached to the console and not in separated plastic bags. Drinks were horrible. The flight attendants were nice. The stewardess told us at the end of the flight that planes were switched in Frankfurt.Our flight from Frankfurt to Athens was on a 321 airbus. Business class was 3 thin coach seats with no one in the middle seat.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-08;Entertainment System and reading lamp didn't work and this is not the first time. I traveled 7 times this year between Canada and Germany with Lufthansa and 3 times the entertainment system at my seat was broken. Especially on such a long overseas flight it is unacceptable!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-08;Lufthansa flight LH763 from Delhi to Munich October 4th 2014. Out-dated and worn business class seats. Possible to recline fully but narrow. Really close to non-existent service. Despite few passengers in business class very slow and inattentive service. After initial take-off beverages no more drink service of water or anything else. Food quality like in a cheap charter flight. No one of the staff bothered to serve a quick breakfast to those passengers who wanted to sleep a bit longer not even a cup of coffee.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-05;TXL-FRA-RIX: Both the legs were operated by A321. Crew were pleasant on both the flights especially that onwards to RIX. They were lively willing to help and didn't mind making small talk with passengers. Like all LH flights even this one was refitted with Recaro seats and ceiling attached TV. Passengers were served muesli bars on first leg and on the second leg yoghurt dip with freshly chopped fruits - this is what disappoints me as LH takes pride in being full service airline. Previously they at least served freshly baked bread rolls and sandwiches. LH should really reconsider on snacks they serve as I believe 120 mins are enough to serve a proper small meal although the crew is saving grace and made several drink rounds. I have travelled extensively on different airlines and wouldn't hesitate to suggest LH to up their game.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-01;LH 465 9/21/2014. Lufthansa provided excellent value a very pleasant flight experience and great professional staff from pilots to cabin crew! It is always a pleasure to fly with Lufthansa because their crew really values you and gives you the best flight experience possible. The cabin crew were very responsive. The seats were comfortable. There is none of the nickel-and-diming miserliness other airlines seem to specialize in. The service is prompt courteous and generous!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-01;LH 464. The plane was changed between flight booking and the flight itself therefore all passengers (especially families) could not sit together as originally planned. Everything was mixed up. The way the flight attendants worked with this was not very helpful. Many children were on this flight. The flight back was much better. Nevertheless I would book Lufthansa again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-01;DUS-LHR-DUS. One of the last LH-routes out of Dusseldorf because LH has transferred almost all European and domestic flights to Germanwings. That's a pity because once again LH showed why it's a great airline. Friendly staff -ground and air - and a very punctual performance on both legs. Tasty sandwich two drinks and reasonable comfort on the A320. A little more expensive than the LCC's but it's worth it. LH stays my favourite airline. And once again Dusseldorf airport is a breeze.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-10-01;AC 9433 - LH476 on Tuesday Sep 23rd 2014. Innovative food. Good service. Generous inflight entertainment. Seat is as uncomfortable as everybody else's in economy.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-28;Our return flights MAN-Munich LH2503/2 Aug 26 and Sep 23. Consistently reliable friendly and courteous staff. Cabin in reasonable condition. Very happy to fly Lufthansa on this route. We also flew return MUC-YVR LH476/7 on the same dates. Outbound 26 August. Inbound 23 September. The business class seats were fine we were in rows 4 and 11. For me row 4 was far more private. Seats fine but not as good as Qatar's 777 flights. Comfortable reclining and flat for overnight. Slept reasonably well. I'd do this again at the right price. Food fine with reasonable variety. Staff efficient without being engaging whereas staff on the Manchester leg were more friendly and charming on both flights than the long haul crew. Overall happy with experience but do think the long haul staff should be more engaging.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-28;LH436 from Krakow to Frankfurt flight delay 1 hour due to bad weather in Frankfurt end up missing connecting flight to Chicago by few minutes. Big confusion at the airport being sent from station to station 4 times before we finally got to ticket agent than we waited 4 hours to get new flight out of Germany for next morning! Frankfurt to Dusseldorf to Chicago and again delay of 40 minutes and almost missed Chicago flight again thank goodness the airport is small as we got on the plane at the last minute. Airbus is definitely more comfortable than the Boeing 747 - not enough leg room even for someone 5 ft 5 seats too narrow - misery for 9 hours. Staff very nice and pleasant.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-24;"I flew from Frankfurt to Newark NJ on the last leg of a 4-leg trip to Turkey and flew in Business Class on a 747. My seat was dirty with crumbs in the glasses holder wasn't able to use my own headphones for in-flight entertainment and the movies system was slow unresponsive and had few movie choices. I watched a DVD that I brought rather than dealing with these issues. The food was ok but unimpressive although the croissants were fresh and tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed the red wine and was constantly refilled as well as coffee when I switched and the seat was comfortable once I was able to manipulate my 6'1"" frame into a comfortable position. All in all the flight was fine but I wasn't as impressed as I should have been.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-22;"Brand new airbus A330 from Munich to Vancouver. New inflight entertainment with rich variety of movies and music. However the sound volume was far too low for enjoying the acoustics. Seats in Economy improved. Best of all however: very clean washrooms during the entire 10.5 hr flight. Flight attendants went in with gloves quite frequently. Food in economy class was ok I always pre-book Asian Vegetarian which seems to be a ""winner"": tasty and sufficient.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-22;LH721 PEK-FRA Airbus A380. Advance online seat reservation was not working but able to get an aisle during online checkin - which opened earlier than the advertised 23 hours before the flight so most good seats were gone. Seats are very cramped - 31 inch pitch is too small for a long-limbed 6 footer like me. Entertainment system was awful - screen far too close painfully slow the films were old and music content limited audio barely audible. On the plus side staff were excellent.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-22;Flight staff were very friendly and committed to providing good service. Food quality was just okay and the portions were too small for an 11 hour flight. Seating was very uncomfortable providing very little leg room.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;LH 426 FRA to Philadelphia Tues 16th 1pm but changed to LH432 to Chicago at 5.10pm 16th. American connecting flight number to Philadelphia (arriving 1.15am today). Flight from Frankfurt to Philadelphia cancelled and rebooked on a later flight arriving almost half a day later. These things happen but the systematic rudeness and lack of consideration of the staff made matters worse. I've often found Lufthansa staff are among the most lacking in consideration of any airline.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;LH 475 Sept 14 2014 YUL to MUC. Great staff service that ensured my wife and I plus luggage were on this flight in spite of a non-through ticket and just 50 minutes of transit time. The flight itself was much less pleasant - cramped seats not enough foot room in front of seat and an entertainment system that leaves much to be desired.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;I am traveling frequently with Lufthansa and am usually quite satisfied. On the positive side of LH415 I would like to mention that they managed to transfer my luggage although United co-chair LH9295 was extremely late. The seats on LH415 can however only be rated as less than adequate. LH does not yet offer any form of economy plus. The seat are both rather narrow (8 lines of seats in an A330!) and the spacing between them is completely insufficient for tall people. I will not fly this airplane in this configuration anymore. The provision of classical music is mostly absent.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;Unfortunately check-in was rather unfriendly and extremely picky about baggage numbers sizes and weights. Neither professional nor customer-oriented service. The actual flight was pleasant only food quality was not as adequate as during flight from MUC to YVR (poor seasoning pasta overcooked). Unfortunately no non-alcoholic beer on-board.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;Flight form Munich to Malaga LH1834. Flight left on time and arrived 10 minutes early. Surprisingly good legroom for economy but there is no entertainment offered what so ever bring your iPad if you want to watch something. Flight attendants were friendly sandwiches were served we good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-19;"LH 476 MUC-YVR 3 Sep 2014. Direct flight in a Airbus 330 which seems to be a small aircraft for such a long 10 hour flight. Food in Y class as bad as always on European airlines. Seats extremely narrow for such a long haul flight (OK for European or continental flights but for Intercontinental flights not enough space). Service as good as it can get in this class. Beverage OK but below standard compared for many airlines particularly in comparison to Asian or Gulf region carriers. Entertainment system really bad (old films that I can hardly remember from my youth). Seat distribution unclear and not well thought through (eg LH has an initiative for ""doctors on board"" and medics can subscribe to this program however flight attendants do not seem to be aware of this initiative in addition medics obviously are not listed thus unknown and do not get seats easy to be prepared for emergencies. Instead they are often seated in the middle of the rows thus hindering them to quickly react).";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-17;Vancouver-Munich-Dusseldorf. LH477 YVR to MUC on 3/4.9.14. Good service by ground staff priority security Maple Leaf Lounge International by Air Canada (good Business Class Lounge). A330-300 with new First Class. Beautiful cabin clean and in good condition. Flight on time. Excellent service from a professional and very friendly crew in a nearly full cabin. Dinner (including caviar) and breakfast top class wide choice of good beverages. Good quiet and dark cabin for night flight. In Munich limousine service to the terminal and assistance to the LH-First Class lounge excellent lounge with a wide choice of high-class food and beverages and own passport control by German Federal Police. LH2016 MUC to DUS on 4.9.14 (Business) with A320. Flight on time. Friendly staff small high quality menu. All in all an outstanding satisfactory experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-17;LH 494 MUC-YYZ Sept 1 2014. Nice exit row seating with availability to Senators unfortunately the exit row reservation has now also become available for an extra charge limiting the benefit of the Senator status. Smooth flight and inflight entertainment with no issues.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-14;YUL-MUC LH475. Flight and information: good seats are tight. Entertainment system: Screen was bad as the image jumped (trough all programs) good choice of programs/movies. Service: good. Food: chicken was awful lentils fine breakfast average.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-14;"There are very few flights between London and Hanover so thinking Lufthansa was an organized airline my firm booked me a flight via Frankfurt. It's a mediocre flight from London to Frankfurt however the flight parked at the gate they did not use the finger instead passengers were all expected to get out at the rear of the aircraft and take a bus ride to another part of the airport (this seems to happen a lot with Lufthansa flights from London to Berlin and Dusseldorf too). After an involuntary tour of the airport I battled my way through security customs and immigration to get to the Hanover gate only to find the plane had gone. To my way of thinking this represents ""mis-selling"" as there is no way anyone is ever going to make the advertised connection in 30 minutes (not at Frankfurt anyway). Perhaps Lufthansa regard English passengers as ""under-people"". To add salt to my wounds Lufthansa made no apologies and just bumped me onto the next flight four hours later. I complained again at Frankfurt customer service which was a log wait amongst the flotsam and jetsam but was only offered a €10 coffee voucher which I declined as an insult. I can only assume that Lufthansa is now competing with German Wings for the most miserable service. Try and leave a comment on Lufthansa's web page and they actually believe people still use fax machines.";NEGATIVE

lufthansa;2014-09-06;I flew with Lufthansa from Montreal to Berlin overnight on Friday. I had a very nice flight. The seats were comfortable the food was tasty the service was friendly and overall I was quite pleased. My only complaint was that the plane was very cold. Also the flight was quite expensive. However I am usually willing to pay a bit more for a Lufthansa flight. The inflight entertainment system was having some trouble as well. It was very very slow.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-06;Last Sunday Aug 25 2014 I was flying from Warsaw to Frankfurt when the Lufthansa plane leaving for Frankfurt was delayed due to some unexpected circumstances. As a result I missed my connecting Air Canada flight from Frankfurt for Calgary. When I went to Lufthansa desk at the Frankfurt airport the ladies there were more than accommodating trying to offer me as many options as possible to get me to my destination. I opted for the next day flight to Calgary via Vancouver. The stay at the Interhotel at the Lufthansa expense was very pleasant great food and room made me forget about a snag in my return trip. But the biggest surprise was still awaiting me at the boarding time when I learned that my ticket was upgraded to Business Class. Excellent service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-06;Flew IAH-FRA-TXL and back FRA-IAH and First Class Service did live up to the title. The NEK in Europe might need some extra legroom instead of the empty middle seat. Friendly Crew great culinary experience and just a good way to go over the Atlantic. A380 is good way to travel.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-06;Flew LH 454 21 Aug 14 FRA-SFO A380 and LH797 31 Aug 14 HKG-FRA B748. Great service provided in the air as well as on the ground. Food choices were good and fresh. Unfortunately the A380 still had the old angle-flat seat. The B748 had the new flat beds.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-06;PRG-FRA-SIN-FRA-HAM both trips with late evening departures. Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly. It's hard to get a good night's sleep in economy but the overall experience is still as painless as it gets.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-01;LH411 from JFK to Munich 23 August 2014. I sat in Business class together with my family. The comfort was satisfactory for the space the seats and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of good quality. Overall I appreciated the service and quality of this airline. I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa both in economy and business so I recommend it to everyone.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-09-01;First Class Service in First Class Cabin. Well there might not be much justification to buy a first class intercontinental flight ticket since a business class flight will be a fraction of cost which may give your controller a hardtack. But if you just have to stay for a meeting in the US and return within 48hrs to your desk in Europe you might consider for your personal sake to spend more money just to arrive back home relaxed. Lufthansa new First Class offers an outstanding service to arrive rested ready to make decisions. Compared to some of the Gulf Region Airlines the Lufthansa first might be considered plain and functional but the service is professional and surpassing.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-28;Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation. The seat was finally changed grudgingly - without apology or even a smile - at the gate to 55G at a part of plane and side I did not like at all.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-28;On this very short 40 min flight from Frankfurt to Brussels Lufthansa managed to serve a full and very yummy breakfast. Efficient and impressive service on this 737-500 plane. The American airlines could learn something from Lufthansa about service and meals on short regional flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-28;July 13th 2014 LH2067 HAM-MUC. LH0476 MUC-YVR. Aug 2nd 2014 LH0493 YVR-FRA. LH0016 FRA-HAM. Our flights were on time and regarding the soccer-final Germany-Argentina we received a special service - free wifi and cold- fresh beer. That was excellent. Lufthansa does not provide perfect space and service however as an economy-flyer I trust in the quality of the planes and I'm always satisfied with LH.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-28;Although I managed to check-in online with Lufthansa via Avianca given an earlier connecting La Paz to Bogota flight the latter did not let me print boarding passes told to report to the check-in counter. Thus I had to join 30-40 person long check-in queues at 2 am taking an hour to clear. There was a long layover of 14 hours in Bogota so connections via Star Alliance are not convenient. The seat assigned for the 11-hour Lufthansa LH 543 flight BOG-FRA on Sunday 24 August was totally different from one I selected online - 24D versus 55K and at odds with what I had requested on booking months earlier and as stated permanently on my Silver frequent flyer record. I asked for the seat to be changed but was told that this could not be done on the Avianca system only in La Paz by Lufthansa despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance. At Bogota airport I was informed initially by Lufthansa staff that this was due to overbooking and 'nothing' could be done. They also tried to put the blame on me for not informing them earlier or checking-in earlier. I had done my online check-in 24 hours ahead of Avianca flight which was about 38 hours ahead of the Lufthansa one - well before most others would have checked-in and so should have got my selected seat. I was then told of a 'special offer' of a business class upgrade of USD600 - another profit-maximising effort instead of service-recovery of a complimentary upgrade or even a USD100 one which I might have accepted in desperation.

lufthansa;2014-08-26;The most comfortable seats now in the new A330-300 in business as well as in economy the entertainment system actually works (though your own headset might be a bit better than the Lufthansa one in coach) and delicious food in business plus the usual chicken or pasta (sorry pasta is out) in coach. Don't worry the chicken is fine. What do you want more for your money? I did continue on Air Canada with expensive poor food in domestic headset you pay for but which do not work is that really necessary to save cost? I would rather fly on Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;LH411 from JFK to Munich 18th August 2014. I sat in Economy class together with my kids. The comfort was more or less unsatisfactory because of the space between the rows the passengers around us and the service. Staff were not very friendly and motivating all additional drinks had to be requested by ourselves and their presence in the cabin was very low. Seemed that they were more interested in talking than working. I am frequent traveler and spend thousands of Euros on LH tickets every year and have experienced the following: the prices have increased and the service and quality decreased. I do not feel or see any value for money.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;Aug 1 2014 JFK to Vienna flight OS88 operated by Austrian Air (through Lufthansa). Return Aug 14 2014 Prague to Frankfurt flight LH1397. Frankfurt to JFK flight LH404. My first and last trip with Lufthansa! I booked in Feb 2014 for a trip in Aug. My wife and I are senior citizens and booked bulkhead seating (knee problems). When we arrived at the airport we were informed that our reserved seats were given away. We were given no explanation and promptly given two middle seats in different aisles. When I protested I was told there was nothing that could be done. Later we were given middle seats next to each other. The TV screens did not work properly-a perfect ending to a terrible flight.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;ARN-FRA-MAN 21 August 2014. Flight left Stockholm on time. Professional and friendly crew. Aircraft had new space saver seats with a 30 inch seat pitch which for a 6 ft guy was comfortable. Lufthansa provided a pizza snack and beverages (including alcohol) on this flight. Transfer at Frankfurt was only an hour but travelling from a schengen to a non schengen country was a breeze despite the long walk. Second flight similar to first. Arrived in Manchester on time. Would recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;I had PAR-TBS-PAR via Munich by Lufthansa. Excellent service again with hot food and plenty of beverages to/from Tbilisi. The service is the best (together with Turkish airlines) on this route. The FA were very helpful and attentive throughout the flight. Lufthansa keeps outstanding quality on this route which is important for overnight flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;11/8/2014 LH475 YUL-MUC. After online check-in (even without printed boarding pass / mobile phone) baggage drop- off at Montreal airport (YUL) was done within 5 mins. Landed on time. Friendly service. Quiet flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-26;Flight Lufthansa 414 Munich - Washington. Another positive experience with Lufthansa. Service reliability quality was very high. Flight was on time (arrived earlier then planned). Personnel were friendly food good etc.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-20;"PEK-MUC July 22 Flight LH723. Aircraft Airbus A340-600. Although I had checked Lufthansa site and was informed that my flight would have the ""new Business Class service"" it turned out that the small prints rule: this aircraft had the old and outdated Business class seats which from my point of view cannot provide the comfort Lufthansa's competition offer as none of its positions (seating leaning fully extended) could offer satisfactory comfort. Cabin crew very efficient polite discreet and professional. Food wine and beverages more than average. IFE limited. Lavatories very clean throughout the flight. Cockpit and cabin crew announcements informative. Amenities of high quality.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-18;Another great flight MUC-YYZ on the Airbus A330-300. Meals the best I've tasted on a transatlantic flight with real cutlery!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-18;LH 414 7 Aug 2014 MUC-IAD. I have 3 complaints about the flight with my wife last Thursday: 1) With the online check-in I could not get a boarding pass. There was a message that a failure occurred but not which kind of failure and how to correct it. 2) There were two check-in lines at the airport. After 30 mins queuing Lufthansa personnel asked me for the boarding pass before I could continue in the line. As I could not get a boarding pass online or with the machine I could not go to the check-in counter. I had to queue in a second line. 3) At the other counter the seat reservation which we made 3 weeks before was cancelled. All this is very disappointing.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-18;We flew from Munich to Vancouver with LH 476. The airplane was in good shape and there were no delays. I flew with my wife who has Senator status with Lufthansa and I could experience how warmly she was welcomed by the crew. Unfortunately this led them to neglecting me to an extend that I had to be after them to get something else to drink that what my wife had asked for. Somehow many of the Lufthansa crews on long distance flights still miss the opportunities to show some kind of friendliness and one still has the feeling that one is sitting in a bus from A to B. The special meal (Asian vegetarian) was tasty and the wine selections was good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-18;We chose to connect with LH 482 A380 in Frankfurt to get from Paris to Miami even though we could have gone non stop on Air France/Delta. A great and wise choice especially for business class seating. Entire top deck of the A380 is premium seating only 6 across in business all seats recline 180 and face forward. First class service in every regard!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-15;MUC-VIE: LH (LH Cityline) A new CRJ 900 for this short flight absolutely okay. We got a snack free choice of drinks and the staff were friendly.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-15;Flew London Heathrow (LHR) to Larnaca (LCA) via Munich (MUC) on 22/07/2014 in economy. Used the refurbished T2 at LHR for the first time as this is Star Alliance's new gateway at LHR. Check in process was chaotic. 4 other Star Alliance flights (an earlier DLH a Brussels Airlines flight an Austrian flight and a LOT flight) also checking in at the same time in the 2 check in areas open. Absolutely dreadful system. Passengers at risk of missing their flight being constantly pulled out of the snaking queue system and fast tracked to check-in. LHR Star Alliance handling agent staff at check-in/boarding gate seemed to be in a bad mood and were minimally communicative if they bothered to reply to you at all. LHR to MUC on A320. Airbridge was 'out of order' so had to walk to aircraft. On board: nice clean plane. Friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck staff. 40 minute delay leaving LHR (20 mins due to broken airbridge and then another 20 mins in the queue on the taxi-way waiting for our turn to commence the take off roll). On time departure from MUC. A321. Airbridge available. Clean plane though looked a bit more worn than our earlier A320. Again friendly cabin crew. Excellent English language skills from both cabin and flight deck crew though announcements from flight deck were quite muffled and difficult to understand. Catering fine on both sectors. No IFE on either sector. Seats: typical uncomfortable Airbus minimally padded utilitarian economy seats. Leg room just about enough for a 176cm height person. Happy to recommend Lufthansa though their check-in arrangements at LHR need serious review. The staff service rating applies to aircraft staff. Their LHR ground handling agent's staff would score a zero.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-14;DXB-FRA. My economy experience was great! I was very surprised with the flight and service. The food was not excellent but neither was it poor - it was just right. I got my food on time and staff were very helpful seats were very comfortable. However the inflight entertainment was a little out of date and did not have many choices. Overall though I would definitely recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-14;Flight LH730 from Munich to Hong Kong. Seat G12. It was a very good experience staff on board really careful and friendly. The plane was quite new and seating perfect 180° recliner. Nice food for dinner could be improved for breakfast.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-14;When arriving at check in was told flight was overbooked. Blank seat tickets were issued and luggage taken for flight. At check in told we would have to wait on a reserve list. As this was part of a holiday trip and booked months ago I can not see how our booked seats where not available. These were paid for months ago so you now those seats are sold and therefore cannot understand how you can overbook. Latecomers should wait until all sold seats check in and then offer what is left to them not give away other peoples seats. This was LH2510 9 Aug. We finally got seats far apart from each other.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-11;I was very disappointed with my flight itinerary. When I called Lufthansa to book my outbound flight to Munich Germany I inquired that 25 minutes to arrive at the gate to my connecting flight out of O'Hare Airport was impossible but she assured me I should not have any issues. Well I did my flight was late and I had to run though a crowded airport to get a shuttle bus to the connecting flight gate (United Airlines flight UA 6115 and UA952 on July 4 2014). My flight arrived at 5.25 and my connecting flight starting boarding at 5.20. My inbound (return flight home) was the worst Lufthansa flight I had been on. The plane was a smaller plane only 1 lavatory to serve the economy area on the plane and the food was horrible. I am considering never flying Lufthansa again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-11;Staff on Lufthansa are normally very friendly and professional. Nothing to criticize. The seats in economy are a bit narrow - especially if the guest in front of you reclines the seat. The new onboard entertainment system on flight 477 from Vancouver to Munich is nice - as you have your own high quality touch screen with a standard 3.5 in plug for earphones. So your own (noise cancelling) headphones will work. You also get a USB charger on that. In my case the entertainment system did not contain any movies (probably introduced during service before the flight) and i was not able to watch any for the 11 hr flight.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-11;Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-06;LH476 on 27th July. Great flight very comfortable. Personnel very kind. I was upgraded to Business class and it was a great experience. I'm in Seattle for Business and I will fly back to Munich on Friday.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-06;Excellent Service on the flight from Munich to Toronto. I was upgraded to Business and it was a real treat. All in all the flight was very good. Lots of legroom flat bed to rest wonderful service and good food. If I could change anything: better trays (for food) - this is the only element that I don't think is very comfortable but this isn't a reason to score lower. The LH team was excellent as usual on the flight(s) and it was a wonderful end to being in Europe by having gotten the upgrade into business.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-06;LH 476 30th July 2014. Fantastic flight with bonus points from miles and more in first for the entire family to Vancouver. Very friendly service both on the ground (the lounge in Munich was superb) and during the flight. The crew were very helpful and friendly. Everything was perfect except for the luggage delivery in Vancouver which despite our priority tags came last.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-03;Frankfurt-Greece Zurich to Munich Munich-Toulouse Toulouse-Frankfurt on different days all within 8 days in July. Very pleased with the service and smiles. Friendly staff. All are short-haul so no entertainment. There were one or two flights with proper meals but the others only had snacks and drink. The food was all right as they are very short. The seats were hard but has okay comfort level. Some times check-in get a little confusing for the crew but that's my own problem as I transferred a lot. Pretty satisfied overall!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-03;BOS-MUC on A340-600. Smooth check-in with an exceptionally polite and efficient agent. The cabin was spotless with soothing colours and perfect temperature. The FA's were very attentive and maintained the professionalism and efficient service I am accustomed to from LH. The seats were the old angled business class seats which were comfortable in all positions except for sleeping as one tends to slide off the seat. The in-seat USB power did not work on any of the four seats my travel companions and I were seated in. The AVOD selection was limited and inferior to other transatlantic airlines. The meal service was prompt and the food was tasty. There was a wide range of beverage options with a good wine selection. Flight left and arrived on time. Lufthansa offers a good product with dependable service surprises are rare if any.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-03;LH 457 24th July. The food is great you'd always want another plate even in Economy. The service and the crews are always friendly and willing to fulfil every need. They did come through the cabin every 20 minutes offering a selection of drinks from a tablet to not disturb the passengers sleeping. Onboard even in Economy nearly every drink is included and so you'll never regret choosing Lufthansa! The only drawback is the inflight entertainment system installed on the A380's and 747-8's the new RAVE system they refit onto the A330/A340 fleet is great but sadly it isn't available upon delivery of the aircraft as manufacturers don't install this system. But though the selection of movies in different languages is great the only bad thing about the system on A380 and 747-8 is the screens are responding extremely slow and they are quite small due to a lot plastic surroundings. And the flight information is insufficient as the system doesn't show altitude speed (ground and air) flight heading wind speed and direction and such stuff. Overall great flights with just this minor drawback.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-03;I flew from Frankfurt to Washington on July 28 2014. The cabin crew were great and the service was fantastic. I ordered a vegetarian special meal and it was delicious. I was at one of the exit row seats and it was very cold. I talked to the crew about it and they took care of it immediately. I have been flying Lufthansa for the last 21 years and their service has been excellent. I never fly any other airline.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-08-03;Flew Business Class round-trip LAX -Stockholm Stockholm-SFO. I flew the 747-800 and was really impressed with the new Business. I sat downstairs and had a seat in the middle section where every seat is an aisle. Spacious and comfortable. All flight attendants are gracious - would not say so much that the food was any better than UAL. In fact their little mousse dessert was nothing compared to UAL's Ice Cream sundaes. On Lufthansa they gave us a small tin for the amenity kit. The toilets are well stocked with amenities. Inflight entertainment on the new 747-800 was exceptional. So many choices. The return flight from Munich was delayed due to a broken aircraft. We left about 2.5 hours late from MUC. They offered everyone food vouchers and handled the delay very well. While the old Business Class seating on this A340-600 is not at all as nice as the New BC - it was ok. The crew were exceptionally friendly and very careful to make sure that everyone was taken care of.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-31;The flight I took 3 days ago (Vancouver-Munich) was one of the most unpleasant flights I have taken of late. I am a vegetarian but eat dairy and yet again I was served the most disgusting food and snacks sorely lacking in flavour and variety. It is always the same and having taken 4 long haul flights with Lufthansa in the last month the meals are predictable and a major let down every time. I take my own food on board depending on allowances at airports but the vegetarian option (lacto-ovo) is lacking dairy and it is very frustrating to see others getting food that makes me even more hungry. Further the seats are very uncomfortable compared to other airlines with leg room appearing to shrink. Flying with other airlines I never suffer back ache but do on Lufthansa flights. I have seen standards drop over the years and find partner/star alliance partners are usually better. The staff were very brisk and unfriendly on the latest flight snatching ear phones from my hands 30 minutes before landing and knocking my friends arms passing in the aisles with carts constantly. The onboard entertainment again is limited compared to other airlines with less choice in both films TV and languages.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-31;"LH410 on Sunday 20/07. Munich to JFK. The cabin crew are efficient but not especially friendly. Food is awful and always the same: Chicken or pasta (it's a well known joke between people traveling often to and from this destination). Not a fan of the new seats less comfortable than the old ones especially if you are more than 6""2 like me.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-29;Frankfurt to Greece then Zurich to Munich Munich to Toulouse Toulouse to Frankfurt. Very friendly staff always smiling no IFE as they are all very short flights. Seats are hard and thin but still comfortable. Not all flights had meals but the food and drinks were alright. But now Lufthansa is famous to me for losing my luggage as I lost them twice with only 4 flights should have better luggage services.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-29;FRA-BCN A321 on July 24 LH1130. Flight out of FRA was delayed. The seats are like camping folding chairs. Very uncomfortable! Fortunately only a short haul flight. One out of three bathrooms not fully operational on a fully booked flight. The purser confirmed that she was aware of the bathroom situation and that she had already two prior flights on the same aircraft that day. During beverage service same purser opened a bottle of sparkling wine mid cabin and showered three rows of guests plus the interior. There was sparkling wine dripping off the ceiling and the overhead bins for the next 15 min. Highly unprofessional! All in all not acceptable.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-29;I travelled FRA-DEN on LH 457. The trip started with a two hour stay at Lufthansa's First Class Terminal in Frankfurt. Not only is the environment unique. There are dedicated security check and passport control facilities at this terminal which make travelling much more pleasant. Passengers are transferred by Limo from the First Class Terminal to the plane. The First Class arrangement on the upper deck of the Boeing 744 with a seat and a permanent bed for each passenger is unique and gives you a lot of personal space and privacy. The food was excellent and very well presented. Service by the cabin crew was attentive but not intrusive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-29;LH 3618 and LH 712 FRA-ICN. I went from Cologne Central Station to Frankfurt Airport Station by AIRail and flew from Frankfurt Airport to Seoul Incheon. The train ride was fast and convenient as well as the check-in at the train station at Frankfurt Airport. No queuing necessary so the transfer time of around 2 hours was almost too long since security checks were not crowded. The flight left on time and arrived 30 minutes early. The service was excellent the cabin very modern (new 747-8) and the inflight entertainment offered a lot of variety of current movies and TV shows. Another benefit is that the train ride from Cologne to Frankfurt is rewarded with Miles too. All in all it was an excellent flight experience and I definitely recommend flying Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-29;LH 104 Frankfurt - Munich 23 June 2014. LH 103 Munich - Frankfurt 21 July 2014. During both flights because of the short time at disposal and in spite of crew efforts beverages were only served to some people. I suggest they only serve cold pre-packed drinks and make sure they serve everybody.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-27;LH 418 6 July 2014. Overall pleasant flight on the 747-8. Anybody with any financial means should avoid economy. The problem is not with the airline but the travel companions. The only real drawback are the seats which are too narrow in economy to sit in without severe back pain. I avoided the bathrooms. Luckily the flight was only 8.5 hours. What surprised me a bit was the shape of some of the interior knowing that the 747-8 is only around for a short while (carpeting wall sidings). As usual the staff is really top notch and worlds apart from US carriers and - sad to say - AF / KLM or BA. This is a different flying experience though not Singapore quite yet either.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-27;BRU-JFK via FRA 1st class - lounge in FRA is just perfect - Limo from and to plane also great service on board all is excellent service. B747-800 configuration is top notch except perhaps rest rooms because people from C class cabin tend to use this rest room. Apart from that baggage delivered on time. Will recommend.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;Our European travel was MUC-ZAD July 12 and ZAD-MUC-FRA July 20. We got upgraded on first leg and overall all 3 flights were on time and with friendly crews. Planes looked clean and new Eco Class seats were OK for the short flights. Happy Lufthansa has improved in terms of service and friendliness.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;Flew 4 flights in total with Lufthansa whilst in Europe. Found the planes to be new and pleasant. The service from the check in staff and cabin crew however was nothing short of rude. Very blunt and did not pay any attention to staff during the flight (most were in conversation even during meal service). I asked the FA on one flight to store a small piece of art for me to which she said there was no room. Not impressed with their punctuality around boarding and departure.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;LH1785 Ankara to Munich and then onto Manchester. Not great the airline gave away my pre-booked seat with extra room. Not good considering I paid extra for it. Fortunately the check-in staff managed to sort me out a replacement. The airbus was not too bad the crew were very helpful. The inflight meal was absolutely dreadful. Neither I nor the crew could determine what form of protein it was. The horrible food and the airline giving my seat away soured what would have been a reasonable flight. I fly on business a great deal but not with Lufthansa again if I can help it.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;I flew Lufthansa last week. Flight number LH451 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. Plane was clean staff very friendly seats reasonable comfortable (in economy class) food and beverages were good. I would recommend Lufthansa to anybody else. Plane arrived on time to the final destination and safe.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;"FRA-HKG. Departed from the ""Z"" section of the terminal which is a hike. Boarding handled efficiently though getting everyone to take their seats proved to be a challenge. This is one of the newer 747s and the Y class seats are very good: aside from a decent recline the front of the seat lifts a bit as you lean back taking pressure off your lower back. Meal and service were good and flight arrived early in HKG.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-25;Last month I flew FRA-Malta-FRA. With the exception of one seemingly bored and unfriendly flight attendant both crews were highly professional obviously well trained attentive and friendly. Both flights on time the cabins spotless. Good Service as usual especially regarding drinks. The only problem are the snacks they offered. On the first sector a plastic cup of fresh fruit salad and yoghurt tasty but not at all filling. Much worse on the flight back: a slice of disgusting lukewarm pizza of low quality in a bland cardboard box without logo a really bad presentation. Such a pity that this reliable airline one of the very best in my opinion is failing again and again with the snacks and food which is offered. Very good ticket rate booked early in advance.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-17;LH 1793. Overall a nice flight on time and efficient boarding and leaving the plane. Might be a surly morning but one of the attendants had an unnecessarily rude attitude. Just because I was slow to stand up (and crouch under the low ceiling) to leave the plane he asked me if I was ever going to leave and that other passengers wanted to get out as well. Never has this been a problem on any other airline. He also gave surly remarks to other passengers who didn't perform well enough. Sorry if this is a charm and humour I didn't pick up on though.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-17;LH415 11 July 2014 Washington Dulles to Munich. I was lucky getting a seat with more space for the legs (front row). As usual I was very pleased to fly with Lufthansa. Unlike other times the seat comfort was not so nice I was not able to sleep. Could be either a matter of coincidence or the version of the seats on that plane. Looking nice and being brand new but pretty hard and not a good shape for my body.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-15;Flight from Perth to Frankfurt via Singapore. Pleasantly surprised that the Lufthansa A380 flight was more pleasant (happy crew) and comfortable than the code-share Singapore airline flight Perth to Singapore. However the return flight from Toulouse to Perth turned into a nightmare due to thunderstorm causing delays into Frankfurt. The almost total lack of customer care while stranded over night at Frankfurt and a 7 hour wait to re- book (almost 5 hours of which was in a line on foot) was a disgrace. It is the fear of this recurring which means I will be highly unlikely to fly with Lufthansa again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-15;I prefer Lufthansa whenever possible. But on this flight LH 494 from Munich to Toronto we had the 4 middle seats on row 40 and there was no arm room. The room for the legs is also quite scarce. Other than the uncomfortable seating everything else was OK. My son had stomach issues and the flight attendants were very helpful.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-15;Vancouver to Munich LH 477 4 July 2014. I found the Food to be sub-standard for a European airline and they also only serve German Wines. The seats are so cramped in Economy Class that it is hard to stretch yourself. They give you warm napkins only on the onward flight and not on return flights. I was carrying my suits so I asked the flight attendant if he could hang my suit in the wardrobe for me and his body language was so obvious that he did not want to oblige my request! Only when I argued with him did he agree to hang my suits. Flight attendants are generally unfriendly they hardly smile and it seems that they are doing the passengers a favor! They generally make a big thing even when your baggage is overweight by 2 or 3 kgs they only allow 23 kgs per passenger in Economy. Compare this to Emirates where you get a generous Baggage allowance of 30 kgs per person on Economy. When I checked at Vancouver Airport for my return flight my baggage was only overweight by 4 kgs but one of the airline staff members was very kind and allowed me to check my Bag in. If not for her I would have had to certainly pay an excess baggage fare!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-13;"June 10 2014 LH 493 to Frankfurt. July 3 2014 LH 476 to Vancouver. We paid extra for exit row seats and were not disappointed lots of legroom. Only critique was that people tend to congregate around area for bathrooms which isn't a big deal but when they hang out there for more than half an hour and keep bumping into you while you're trying to sleep then it's annoying. Outgoing flight was 747 and seemed to attract more ""standers"" return flight was 330 and shape of cabin did not encourage people to hang around as much. Pleasantly surprised at number of meals and snacks during both flights lots of variety service was great and flight attendants went out of way to accommodate other passengers with young children. Look forward to flying Lufthansa again hopefully in Premium or Business Class next time.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-13;LH 457 3rd July. Overall very good. The available leg space was however below all criticism. For some reason the A-C seats on row 44 on the 747-800 had about 1 decimeter less leg space than the other seats on the same row (and the rest of the plane). I have never been so cramped on an Intercontinental flight before (or any flight for that matter).;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-06;MUC-CGN return (twice). I am always happy when I can book Lufthansa (work related) because it is such a reliable and punctual airline. The check-in and boarding is very easy the planes are always clean a little snack and two drinks are provided and I can choose my favourite newspaper. Usually the crew greets with a smile and has a service-orientated attitude. The seats are a bit hard but for one-hour domestic flights this is no problem.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-06;"27 June 2014 flight LH454. I flew Lufthansa from Frankfurt to San Francisco on an A380 and it is not an experience I would like to repeat. I know flying economy is supposed to be uncomfortable and unpleasant on any airline but adding hundreds of passengers to what most other airplanes carry only compounds the misery. Space tight seats very narrow and food bland as usual for economy. What made this flight ""memorable"" were the long boarding lines and the length of time it took to get off the airplane after an 11 hour flight. I hope the A340 and the A330 airplanes stick around for a long time to come.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-06;My flight to Washington with Lufthansa in Economy Class was a very convenient one. As I am a chronic patient I liked that I had enough space to move my feet water was offered often enough. The meals were fine and entertainment was abundantly offered.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-06;I travelled with LH1402 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Prague (Czech Republic) on June 23 scheduled 21.55-22.55. Due to late change of aircraft from the planned Airbus A321 to an Airbus A320 Winglets the flight was slightly delayed but the flight managed to depart before the awful night ban at Frankfurt Airport. The aircraft was only one week old according to the crew. That was obvious everything was extremely tidy and clean. However no IFE and still the same type of Recaro seats with any support for your head which I find very uncomfortable below industry standards. I was seated in Business Class on seat 4F and the service were excellent. Even on this very short flight a very tasteful salad was served and before the meal drinks were served. Right the way it should be drinks before the meal. An excellent flight and a very good experience and the cabin staff even addressed you by your name when serving excellent.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-06;I travelled with Lufthansa from Stockholm Arlanda Sweden to Frankfurt Germany on June 23. The aircraft on this service was an Airbus A321. I travelled in Business Class and was seated on 4A. The overall experience is very good and everything is well thought through with German precision. The cabin was very clean and tidy and the service was very good. The food served on this route was a cold dish but very tasteful. If to complain about something the service was not especially well co-ordinated. The meal was served first and it took approximately 10 minutes before any drinks were served. I would have expected the opposite in Business Class. Lufthansa does not offer any IFE on intra-European flights but offers very good inflight magazines. The main negative thing to my opinion is the very uncomfortable seats. Recaro slim fit with very limited comfort. There is no head rest available so bring your cushion or maybe two and the seats are very hard. The seat pitch is however according to industry standards. On this occasion I had a connecting flight from Frankfurt with 1 hour transfer time. The flight was approximately 25 minutes late into Frankfurt but there were no problems with my transfer.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-03;Vancouver-Munich-Geneva (4 June 2014) and return (16 June 2014). Flights on time. luggage delivered promptly. cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several juice and water runs on the long-haul flights. YVR-MUC and return: A330-300 with 2+4+2 seat layout. Two proper meals served the usual chicken or stuffed pasta as the mains (and for overnight flight YVR-MUC an omelette as the second meal). The main problem with A330 and A340 aircraft generally is poor seat design in economy. Window seats leave a 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage wasting space and very uncomfortable for anyone trying to lean against the fuselage to sleep. The two outboard seats (window plus aisle) are supported by two central stanchions that rob passengers of foot space. No standard carry-on bag will fit under the seats in front and more foot space is taken up by entertainment boxes. YVR-MUC flight had these problems. However MUC-YVR return flight had a new A330 interior with far better seat design: it still left the 5cm gap between the armrest and fuselage but the two supporting stanchions were at the very ends of the pair of seats leaving proper foot space and enough room that two full-sized carry-on bags could be placed under the seats in front if desired. AVOD offered a vast array of films music and television programs (even binge-watching programs like the complete first season of the US House of Cards). MUC-GVA and return: E195 with 2+2 layout with seats more comfortable than on an A330. Even a sandwiches-and-drinks service for these one-hour flights. Trip rating would be 8 for the old A330 seating 10 for the new A330 seating.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-07-01;Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before. The wine selection is always interesting. Food is good but the offer in the first class lounge in LAX not up to European first class standard. In the on board entertainment you might not find the latest films but it's a good cross selection. The atmosphere and color scheme of the newly designed cabin is very pleasant. Bathrooms are bigger on the 380 than on the 747. The content of the amenity bag is rather disappointing. Selection of reading material is good although I would prefer some travel or culinary magazines. The friendly staff will generally address you by name.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-06-30;LH431 6/21 to 6/27. Inbound was via BRU with LH1006 and UA973. I travelled FC from ORD to FRA in a B747-8 and it was great. I miss only the small snacks (like nuts sandwiches chips) between the meals. UA is offering these snacks. The FC cabin is quiet comfy and spacious.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-30;MUC-LAX on May 19 in a newly refurbished A340-600. Passenger handling at the airport was superb pick-up from aircraft escort to lounge passport formalities all done while we relax. The First Cabin was fully booked and we had two stewards taking care plus the cabin chief checking in occasionally. Aside from the splendid service like in a gourmet restaurant our crew was very cordial and made sure our time was as enjoyable as possible. The only downside I can remember is that the air-conditioning was quite draughty and could not be reduced.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;LH 439 on A330 DFW-FRA with friendly attentive and professional staff. Nice flight only the old Business Class Seats getting more and more outdated.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;LH1935 TRS-MUC and LH474 MUC-YUL on Friday June 20th. I usually fly Lufthansa since the local airport near the city I work in is fairly connected with one of its hubs. Even if the flight tickets are a bit expensive I think they provide a reliable service and have a good customer service. Last flight was on the same line an intercontinental one and even travelling economy class you're quite comfortable aboard. I wish the other airlines I use when star alliance partners are not available would provide a similar service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;Flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando June 21 2014. Trip started in Istanbul June 21 2014 on flight 1305. We booked our flights 9 months ago. My seat on flight 464 from Frankfurt to Orlando was 39c. I checked in online double checked at the Frankfurt gate still 39 c. Once onboard my seat was given to another who booked late. The new seat was in another section of the plane nowhere near my husband. Since the flight was full the attendants would not move this passenger and were unhelpful. The purser was surly and rude.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;LH414 MUC-IAD on 15 June 2014. Aircraft great most of the crew were great but there were 2 unfriendly staff members amongst them. Otherwise everything was fine including the weather smooth flight captain's announcements informative and clear. Seat 24C has no legroom due to the partition. The seat itself is ok for economy class but the partition is too close to the knees.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;I am German and used to be a loyal Lufthansa customer. In general it is probably still one of the better Airlines out there but the way they treat the average customer who are just Frequent Traveler status or even less and not Senator or Hon is just plain deplorable. The way they credit now for miles flown tells me that they don't value my business at all anymore. Another annoying thing is the discrimination against carry on bag travelers who are not Gold level. I invested quite some money into a carry on to make sure that it would be in compliance size wise according to international standards and IATA approval but yet I was forced at various occasions to give it up when I was just about to board the flight. The most recent very bad experience I had was when I was just coming off the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt and wanted to connect on the domestic flight to Berlin LH 180 on Sunday June 1st at 10.45am. The gate agent ladies serving the desk for that flight were just horrible to say the least forcing me to check my carry on bag  which I had no problem carrying on the transatlantic flight from Dulles to Frankfurt. It's one thing if there are viable reasons for that to do so but being singled out while others were walking by with two pieces of luggage was an experience of discrimination that I never wish to endure again.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;LH 411 on June 10. Perfect Service especially during check-in for return flight from US because I arrived at airport only 35 minutes before departure. Airline personnel were able to manage a direct security check (bypassing the waiting line) a quick transfer to the gate and also the bag arrived on time with the flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-25;I flew to Washington with United and returned with Lufthansa. I am disappointed by the differences in service between Star Alliance members. Lufthansa was so much better than United. Everything: food friendliness of staff seats. Below ratings are based on Lufthansa flight only.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-23;"LH 419 on 1 Jun 2014 from IAD to FRA. The flight was on time the announcements in German and English were clear and understandable. The Inflight Entertainment didn't respond very quick on fingerprints and some of the movies are not particularly new. I saw the same movie-titles on my flight with this airline 8 months ago. They served pasta or chicken for dinner - it's always the same. The bread they served was warm and tasted very well. The little snack for ""breakfast"" didn't knock my socks off. It was better in the past.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-23;LH 451. We sat exit row seats in the brand new 747-8. Lots of space entertainment system finally up to date with hi-res displays good selection etc. However lots and I mean lots of restroom traffic. LH went cheap and only installed 2 restrooms for middle section of eco class to cram in 2 more rows (however more legroom on this new plane). Ridiculous and therefor many people waiting in line in front of and around your seat at all times. I always bring my own food since LH and most airplane food in economy is inedible so can't comment on food.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-18;LH418 8 June FRA-IAD. I am very disappointed by the new flagship of Lufthansa or to be more precise of its Economy Class cabin. While the cabin itself is very comfortable from an environmental point of view - pressure humidity and noise - Lufthansa simply put uncomfortable seats into the great fuselage. They are too hard and there is not enough leg room. Even for an average 1.83m 79kg male sitting in these seats is a pain. The food is just below anything. One does not even need to compare it to the far better airline meals of Air Canada to come to this conclusion. Privileges for Lufthansa status customers are a joke. The Senator lounge in Dulles is more like a shoe box. Only the staff is making the difference as usual. Great staff on board and on ground is the single reason besides the direct connections why I still fly Lufthansa.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-18;LH451 on 11 June from LAX to FRA. As usual Lufthansa's service - staff food and entertainment - was excellent though it was a bit tough to get the touch screen to react. The economy seats on the new 747-800 however leave something to be desired. While the legroom is alright the seat is very narrow doesn't recline very much not very comfortable on a 10 hour flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-18;Had awful experience on Flight 428/429 from Charlotte NC to Munich Germany and back. Food and drink ran out before all passengers were served no effort was made to correct the problem. Very unresponsive flight attendants as well as purser. Would never recommend this airline.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-18;I connected to LH at Frankfurt from a United flight originating at SFO. The arrival and departure at FRA both involved aircraft parked on remote pads and being ferried on stuffed buses to the terminal buildings where insufficient gate space apparently exists. As I was about to get stuffed onto a bus an imperious LH gate agent demanded I surrender the bag in which I carry my CPAP machine. She couldn't have cared less that I was told to keep close hold on it on all my travels and other airport staff have no problem treating it as carry-on. Furthermore there was plenty of bin and underseat space on the flight. Other than that nastiness the flight itself was fine and LH probably deserves its 4-star rating excepting for transfers at FRA.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-16;GRU (Sao Paulo) - FRA (Frankfurt). Impressed with the new Boeing 747-8. Would expect it to be less noisy though. Not a single seat free all three classes were packed. I have to say that the new seat Lufthansa has chosen for this 748 is quite ok far better than the A340-600 one's. Cabin crew ok but a couple of members were everything but polite. Usual long-haul dinner choice (pasta or chicken) usual breakfast. Arrived in FRA 25 minutes before schedule. I keep saying Lufthansa and SWISS beat whatever European airline.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-16;My wife and I booked a return ticket leaving Heathrow to Caracas Venezuela via Frankfurt. The final part of our journey was an internal flight to Barcelona Venezuela where we had planned to visit family. This part of the journey was without incident the return flight was a nightmare. We were due to leave Caracas on May 2013. We started our journey very early leaving to take internal flights from Barcelona to Caracas. Upon presenting ourselves at check in we were informed that our tickets had been accidentally canceled and that it was an internal error of the airline and would be corrected. Another person was called to the desk from the 1st class check in who said that the flights had been cancelled and that we could not travel as a refund had been issued. No explanation was offered and no one knew on whose authority our tickets had been cancelled. We were told the only way we could travel that day was to buy another ticket for nearly £3.000 money which we didn't have available at the end of our holiday. The desk attendants refused to help us in any other way.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-16;I traveled on the LH431 flight as a return trip from the US. Considering my initial flight was ok I was quite dissatisfied with LH431. It didn't leave on time (at least 30 minutes of lateness) the food was less varied and less tasty there were malfunctions at the entertainment service and the wi-fi network was out of order. The staff were friendly and well-prepared as usual. I will travel again with Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-13;Munich to Chicago in Economy on an Airbus A340-600. Fasten seatbelt sign turned off five minutes after take-off and not put back on until 30 minutes before landing. Hot towels provided before lunch and after snack. Real tableware used with the lunch not plastic. Free alcohol provided before lunch wine with dinner and two choices of after dinner drinks provided. Five economy toilets were provided in the basement of the plane which was a nice stretch and avoided bad smells in the cabin. Cabin crew were professional and friendly. The seats are very tight luckily the seat next to me was empty. However the flight was nearly full.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-13;LH431. Service and food was good. I travelled with my wife and it was good that we could book two separate seats at the back of the plane so other passengers would not disturb us during the sleeping period.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-13;LH431 ORD-FRA 3/6/14. Aircraft and flight were excellent however the cabin crew were not satisfactory. Service was quite slow and at the same time quite hectic crew were a bit unfriendly did not come back after a request when I went into the galley they at first ignored me talking to each other. On the flight to Chicago this was completely different LH430 30/5/14.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-12;LH 430 7/6/14. As usual cabins were very clean tidy and everything was in extremely good condition. Service as usual very good attentive and friendly. The vegetarian meal was also very good same for the beverages. Considering we were in economy class even the wine was good. The snack prior to landing is not tasting good and of low quality. A simple sandwich with cheese or a soup (pumpkin tomato) would be better and taste better.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-12;June 8th - flight LH450 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. After take-off when the aircraft was at cruising altitude I needed to visit the bathroom. The flight attendant advised me in a very rude way to get back to my seat. We asked for wine during the flight and were advised to wait for the next service. LH crew usually walks through the aircraft with water etc. This crew did not. The food they served was not good. Overall LH450 flight on Sunday June 8th was the worst experience I have had with Lufthansa.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-10;I flew from TXL to MUC with LH. As 4U operates almost all flights from TXL nowadays - having a LCC service - I am always glad to get on a LH flight. The flight was very early in the morning with no delay and very quick check-in at TXL. The service - even if decreased over the years - was including snack and drinks not worth complaining. Good things at LH are the seat comfort being better then with the usual LCC at SXF e.g. and a very good choice of newspapers. As for a rather short flight I really enjoyed the flight and prefer it over other airlines.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-10;ZRH-FRA-GOT. No problems with the flights (although first one a bit delayed). Staff attentive and efficient and planes clean and neat. The sandwich they serve is Economy for the flight is Mozzarella Egg Plant and Aubergine! What on earth makes them think that this is a good combination and why not just serve a cheese sandwich? Judging by the amount of them left by passengers this is a common view point. Overall very good service but trying a little too hard to make a basic sandwich snack into something almost inedible.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-10;JFK-MUC. Always a pleasant flight on Lufthansa. However I thought the seats seemed narrower then on previous flights. Not as much seating room. Food was also not as good as usual. Breakfast was kind of chintzy. Or maybe I just don't like muffins for breakfast. Also not as many movies or TV shows to choose from.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-10;June 1 LH 440 FRA-IAH: Seat 87C - not able to exit any video (touchscreen) had to use the console all over again to restart. Inbound: June 5 LH 431 ORD-FRA Seat 45C. Technically superb mainly on-time unfortunately I had problems with entertainment system on the outbound flight and was unable to recline the seat on the inbound flight - severely impacting my comfort.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-10;"Flight LH 408 from Dusseldorf to Newark on April 26th and from Chicago to Dusseldorf on May 10th 2014. Both Planes had the same 2-4-2 Seating in Economy Class and are equipped with the new RAVE IFE-System. Seat Pitch is 32 inch and width 17.5 inch which is ok for ""midsized"" Travelers. Tray table is fixed in the frame of the seat so it doES not shake if the Person in front is moving. Wide selection of Movies (up to date or older) Music or other Inflight Entertainment. Beverage Service frequently (also during the night flight back to Dusseldorf) first served approx. 20 minutes after take off. Lunch was the typical ""Chicken or Pasta"" my choice was Chicken which was a Curry Chicken and quite good. Flight Attendants were all nice and offered a solicitous service. Breakfast on the flight back was a little bit ""well arranged"" could be served a little bit more. Anyway it was a quite comfortable trip in economy class.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-09;Check-in ok flight was ok but 40 minutes late. Service was friendly. The flight information did not work at all on any screens. I would have expected to get more spoken information during the flight. General: The reduced crediting of miles by booking class is not customer friendly at all. Special upgrade programs: I never succeeded in getting an upgrade to business class with miles online typically a message appears: Not available no matter when.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-08;MUC-BRU on A319 and E195 flight from Munich was very comfortable as the leg space was very good. Flight was on time and the friendly cabin crew served a tasty sandwich and full bar service. Return flight on E195 was one hour late due to late income of the aircraft. I was always a big fan of the Embraer plane but this time I was very disappointed. The seats are cramped and not at all comfortable. Cabin crew again was very friendly. Lufthansa is a very good and reliable airline in my opinion.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-05;MUC-BRU in June 2014. Flight was delayed with about 15 minutes due to late arrival from WAW. Cabin clean and comfortable on this Embraer 195 jet. Excellent crew again drinks and tasty sandwiches were offered on this short flight with a smile. To be recommended!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-05;I was lucky to receive a complementary upgrade to business Class for my flight FRA-LAX. As usual in Lufthansa Business Class the service was excellent personnel always polite and attentive. The inflight entertainment was of best quality in terms of hardware but fell behind competitors in breadth of offering where eg Singapore even in economy has at least 5 times the amount. Lufthansa's service is more conservative than eg Virgin which suits my personal tastes more. I paid for a flexible economy class ticket for the trip FRA-LAX returning JFK-FRA which was in my view expensive but LH was the only carrier able to offer non-stop on both legs - so LH scores again over competitors in this case on global reach. In the past I have been a regular international flyer with LH having had Senator status for at least 10 yr. However this has lapsed and I have recently been travelling mostly as an economy passenger. Accordingly I cannot accurately compare the current standard of LH business with many other competitors with the exception of Singapore and Emirates who unfortunately offer better seat comfort and entertainment. The aircraft on LH450 was a 747-8 which offered less seat breadth in the reclining position than the A380s of Singapore and Emirates.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-05;LH 475 31 May 2014 from Munich Germany to Vancouver Canada. The airplane interior of this Airbus A330 is modern and the entertainment system significantly improved comparing to the one fitted in most of the long haul airplanes of the company. Probably they start updating the outdated entertainment system used for in the last 5 years which was famous for its poor performance poor quality of video instability of system and small number of choices when it comes to movies and music. The food is good in terms of quality and quantity. The stewardesses are friendly and make you feel comfortable. The seats in economy class are narrow offering limited inclination of the back. Very uncomfortable definitely below average comparing to other big players like Qatar Emirates Singapore Turkish. Finally as always Lufthansa arrived on time.;POSITIVE

Good service even for a full cabin. 8 pax total anyway. will try them again. will recommend only 1st class their C class much to be desired. Problem with bags in all stopovers terrible handling service even for 1class pax. This must be improved.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-04;We flew LH 437 ORD to DUS on May 15th followed by LH 2706 DUS to HAM. The planes were nice the seats quite comfortable the food on Flight 437 decent and the flight attendants pleasant. We would fly Lufthansa again for sure.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-04;I had my last flight with Lufthansa on LH430 from Frankfurt/Germany to Chicago on 05/31/14. We had a new 747-800 which was really nice! Also came with some reasonable space for the legs in Economy (I am 189cm tall) however all the seats in new airplanes today look good but completely lack lumber support. Very good and friendly service! Good food and no additional charges did apply for a glass of wine! Keep that up Lufthansa! Also very clean and friendly looking airplane. And finally many choices for the entertainment program (movies) - very good! However I will never understand why Lufthansa does not enable the program once passengers are boarding and leaves it running until at the arrival gate. Most people use their own headphones anyway.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-04;"I have made at least 8 business class segments in long haul flights in Lufthansa in the last 12 months and can certainly say that the service is poor. The 747-400 that I flew from Buenos Aires to Frankfurt and Frankfurt to Tokyo are old the business class is in bad shape the seats are uncomfortable and have the most uncomfortable inclination. The entertainment system is outdated and limited. Catering is at economy class level. Service is no better especially on the flights to Buenos Aires flight attendants appear tired uninterested in helping and some just plain rude. Service is slightly better on the flight I took to Tokyo and Hong Kong to Munich which makes me wonder if the Latin American market is just less interesting for this carrier. In any event the crew attitude appears in general as ""just do not bother me"" never a reply to the call button. I am a frequent business flyer and definitely regret to have chosen this airline and will avoid using this service again if I can. One final comment headphones are attached to the seats and on two flights I had to take the headphones covers that had been left from a previous passenger in order to put the new ones provided to me that is definitely not good service and not a good hygiene standard.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-04;Flying with Lufthansa is always a positive experience to me: reliable punctual efficient. I recently flew from Frankfurt to Los Angeles flight 450 Economy class and on my return flight LH 453 from Los Angeles to Munich I was able to upgrade to Business class by using my Miles and More account. Compared to the Economy class the Business class seats are very comfortable allowing to stretch completely and have a nice rest so that the flight time seems to be much shorter. Also the connecting flights to Verona Italy with Air Dolomiti were perfectly on time. I only wish that the fares to fly in Business class were not so pricy i.e. more affordable then I would book all my travels with Lufthansa in Business class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-03;I was flying from Washington DC to Frankfurt on Sunday May 25 with Flight LH 419. Good Seats Food was terrible Service was not good (I was not greeted by the purser as a Senator & Star Alliance Gold Member) Inflight entertainment very outdated (small screens).;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-02;I flew on May 26th 2014 with LH 415 from Washington Dulles to Munich. Stewardesses were very friendly and also flexible to help me to change my seat after boarding. Meals were ok but not as good as on Austrian Airline flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-02;May 26 2014 LH 431. Good service and food. Nice inflight entertainment with seatback video screens. Not overly impressed with frequent flyer program - having to pay more in taxes for free flights than with other airlines. The seats on this flight had adequate legroom but were narrower and lacked the softness of older aircraft's.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-02;Flew yesterday from Munich to LAX. Seats arranged in bulkhead 8 months ago only to find agent and Seatguru were wrong (6ft long legged female). We kept getting delivered special meals which we hadn't ordered nearing identical each time which were just as bad as the regular meals zero air-con in our section very grumpy attendants many people in our section asked about the air-con but nothing was done. If you stood near the galleys to get some air you were greeted with nasty attendants wanting to know why were we up. Very odd customer service.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-02;Flight LH 431 on 05/26 ORD - FRA we flew first class on the new 747-8. New seats are comfortable. service was what you should expect in first class and food was good. Purserette only briefly greeted the paxs and never was seen again even after the flight had landed in FRA. Her English was terrible.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-06-02;LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient. In sum Lufthansa will reliably get you from point to point (as long as the pilots are not on strike) but it's really an inferior product (a recent Delta business class flight from ATL to Madrid was far superior in every way e.g. food comfort service).;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;LH414 MUC-IAD on May 26. Airbus A330 with quite comfortable seats in economy class. On board service providing variety of food very good choice of beverages. Overall service of good quality. Staff friendly and helpful to passengers. Somehow limited entertainment choice.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;MUC-EWR economy was a great flight on a 340-600. But the return leg from YUL-FRA was a disappointment. Old 340-300 no USB chargers a terrible screen late departure and arrival without explanation and dinner was served by only 2 teams for the entire economy class one by aisle which means that we in the back (row 42 of 27 or so) got ours an hour after they began. This also meant on a 7 hour flight that there was little time between dinner and breakfast. In flight entertainment is pretty poor - 3 weeks between the flights and they were still showing the same episodes of TV shows. Food was nothing special especially the breakfast was an overly sweet muesli bar a muffin and some fruit. So a mixed bag. The crew was ok though.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;LH 424 Munich - Boston. The Lufthansa Economy product provides mostly ok standards. Current economy seats are nearly the same (bad) experience as for every airline. Preferred check-in and Lounge due to Airline status do make the pre-flight procedures a good experience. For this particular flight crew were very attentive serving additional drinks throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment system could use a few more recent films. On time landing and overall no issues.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;Rio to Barcelona via FRA. Had already travelled 17 hours from NZ before taking Lufthansa but crew were warm efficient. Could see I was looking fatigued even on departure and crew got everyone fed and watered soon after 10pm take off. In first row of economy on 744 which meant no one could recline into my face! Seat ok and legroom in first row restricted by bulkhead. IFE didn't work in my row but not fussed as tired (purser handed out 25 euro voucher to use on return to Rio. Appreciated). Teriyaki chicken a strange choice out of Rio (impression coloured by horrible experience of teriyaki chicken on Hawaiian) but tasted better than looked. Campari enjoyed as aperitivo and Baileys as digestivo. Previous LH experiences have been lacklustre but felt the crew were personable and not the usual robots. All in all v satisfied. LH is a reliable airline offering great service and fair prices. Look forward to return flight to Rio this weekend but bound to be full of football fans pre World Cup!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;EWR to DUS on refurbished A340-300 2 class aircraft then A321 to Munich. Efficient check in in Newark pre- boarding for business class. Good cabin ambience and nice new seating with variable firmness option. Area for feet when fully reclined relatively narrow but seat length good for tall person. Very good service from a professional crew. Good quiet cabin for night flight. Good food and wine. Large screen and good programming. Very fast and efficient connection in Dusseldorf and nice lounge. Overall a very nice flight- sophisticated.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-29;Flew VNO-FRA-CPH on 25/5/14 in Economy Class. On the VNO-FRA sector they served a surprisingly good and filling breakfast I hadn't expected anything at all. FRA-CPH sector staff served a pudding and they came around with drinks twice on this 1:15 flight. Staff were very welcoming. Seats could be softer but still there was plenty of legroom. Frankfurt airport itself is very boring but at least Lufthansa provides free coffee/tea and newspapers in the transit area. Will fly LH Again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-28;I had the pleasure to travel on new B747-8i from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles and back to Munich on Airbus - both equipped with the new seats. There's a big difference to the old ones! The seat is stylish and completely flat. Inflight movie selection is great now as well as the earphones. What I like most about Lufthansa is their efficient consistent and very friendly service onboard. The food was like a restaurant. Wine selection fine but could be better and wider. Unfortunately they don't offer cappuccino or espresso. Business lounges are a great plus. Staff at US airports should be trained to be friendlier.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-28;Good hospitality and food. Landing and take-off were smooth. Air-hostesses / Stewards were friendly and attentive - a welcoming smile goes a long way during a long haul trip . Was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to Business Class on my connection from Frankfurt to Chennai. Needless to say the long tiring 9 hour flight was reduced to a very enjoyable one due to the excellent service in Business class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-26;"Flew Business Class - Frankfurt-Shanghai and Shanghai-Munich. This is not Business Class at all. The inclined flat beds are hard and it is not possible to lie on the side due to the curve of the leg rest. The food was at best ""better tourist class"" lukewarm and without any finesse at all. With the exception of a New Zealand white the wines were simply lousy. Very little selection. Will never fly Lufthansa Business Class Again.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-25;YVR-FRA 747-400. Flight delayed due to late arrival but made up for time. Crew efficient and professional except for one FA. Saw me trying to unsuccessfully help an elderly lady put her luggage in the overhead compartment. Bag was too large and FA just ignored us. Meals were average. IFE had limited selections. Aircraft was clean.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-25;I have flown Lufthansa before and had the best of everything. I picked Lufthansa because of prior satisfaction. If this would have been my first flight with Lufthansa I would have chosen a less expensive more direct flight. I guess everyone has an off day let's hope the flight home will the Lufthansa I love. The crew was as great and professional as ever.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-25;I travelled between FRA and JNB on the A380. Like most I was disappointed that this state-of-the-art aircraft was not equipped with the lie-flat bed even though the website indicated that these flights would have them. Regardless I was able to find some level of comfort (eventually) on the angled beds - one has to play around with it until you find that comfort spot! Service overall was good and efficient and the food was fine as far as airline food goes. Nothing fantastic but then again nothing too bad.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-25;Johannesburg-Frankfurt. Excellent flight albeit economy on A380 and there was ample space for stowing hand luggage. Staff efficient and very friendly to start off a drink and some pretzels then dinner service (chicken or pasta) with drinks again coffee and liquor breakfast included scrambled eggs. Seat comfort not bad considering it was economy entertainment worked fine with big selection of movies. All in all a very good experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-23;Aircraft was clean and up to date. Lufthansa service was good as usual. There was a new entertainment system available that was more user friendly than the old one and provided more choice. The problem with the entertainment system were the headphones: the volume could not be adjusted so that all dialogues in movies were understandable.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-23;Singapore to Frankfurt on Airbus A380 a very pleasant journey. The business class seat was comfortable. The entertainment selection was good. The meals were well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines on offer. The service was excellent.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-21;I notice a lot of improvement at Lufthansa as they want to reach 5 star status. Hong Kong - Frankfurt boarding well organized. New Boeing 747-800 good Economy seats and improved inflight entertainment selection. Even a menu card in Economy Class. Food was really good for this service class. First a dinner with Asian or European selection and before landing hot breakfast. They should improve the presentation of the hot dish (tray and extras are fine) and serve warm bread these are always cold and hard. Beverage selection extraordinary. Staff very professional friendly efficient and helped mothers with their kids. I think it's an excellent airline when travelling with a child. There should be more lavatories in Economy class. No amenity kit. Blankets and specially pillows of high quality with real feathers. Plane change to Madrid in Frankfurt: Arrival in the new terminal aera Z hassle free and smooth. Plane to Madrid full. Another hot breakfast was served. Crew very charming and attentive again. No entertainment system - but's that's okay for short flights. Moving map should be introduced. Swiss has it on board even on intra Eruopean routes. In all great experience professional punctual and I felt very safe. But they have to work on the details for the 5 stars: presentation of hot meals hot bread amenity kit better arrival service in Frankfurt for passengers that don't know this giant airport. And entertainment system on short flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-20;LHR-FRA MUC-LHR A319 out A320 return. Both flights left on time 20 minutes late arriving at LHR due to air traffic not the airlines fault. Crews very good. Beer and sandwich both legs.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-20;The flight was OK. The seats were not comfortable and no preferred seats for Senators were offered to me. Food was OK. The flight attendants were good. The entertainment system was stuck for a while and the PA system was very loud.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-20;I used to have very high expectations on Lufthansa which was wiped out with my recent business with them. The flight attendants were rude and never responded to call lights instead they turned it off without responding and I have to get to the galley each time for a cup of water. Mine was a long intercontinental flight with total of 19 hrs flights. The seats are congested and old. Poor quality entertainment system one of headphone speakers not working replaced with another one with without much difference. My 2nd flight was delayed almost 70 mins.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-19;ABZ-FRA-BKK return. Good start to the journey with priority (Business Class Check-in) since I am an FT member. Skipped past a very long queue. 2 luggage of 23 kg checked-in was a nice touch. ABZ-FRA was full good service by the crew with snack and beverage. Not plenty for 2 hrs flight though. Access to Business Lounge is a nice way to spend 2.5 hrs transit with food and plenty to drink as well as shower! FRA-BKK flight was not full and managed to get 2 seats free so get some living spaces for the next 11 hrs. Great crew with smile and helpful. The only downsides are the too hard thin seat for long haul flight and poor selection of entertainment. Departure flight's aircon was set to too warm made it quite hard to get to sleep but it was a one-off fault. Return flights great. Food is more than average. Quite pleased with it. Overall a very good experience with rooms to improve. Definitely recommend Lufthansa especially when the fare is very competitive.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-19;FRA-BKK with onward flight on Thai Airways to SYD. Excellent service by ground staff and cabin crew. Food was outstanding and I managed to sleep throughout the flight. Return flight connecting from SIN on SQ970. BKK-FRA also in F then FRA-HAM in Business. Again a good overall experience though I have to comment on the ground services upon my arrival in FRA. The flight was delayed and it was almost impossible to get to the next gate on time. I would have expected some kind of assistance by LH ground staff in order to make my connection. Other airlines offer this service even to their business class passengers. This could certainly be improved. Both long haul flights were on a A340 with the old First Class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-19;For transit Munich Airport was good. The flight from Zurich to Munich was good with good service. The next flight from Munich to Vancouver was good too only I didn't like the food choice and the way they presented it. If you can improve little on food variety it will be really good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-19;Overall great Service from assistance at the ticket counter upgrading to Business Class on miles to the service on board. Check in was efficient for Business Class.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-19;New Business class is worth flying. Lufthansa made a big improvement at inflight service. Nevertheless the service at the check-in desks in the US need to be improved. Overall it seems Business class is getting better while Economy is getting worse. So for Long flights you should think about upgrading or buying Business from the beginning.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-17;I rated Food and Beverages less than perfect” because of the chicken being served : I'm allergic even to the odor of it. Seats less than perfect” because on the flight to Europe the spacing was very tight return was much better a newer airplane model. Due to all the security checks and their cost my last trip overall experience is a far cry from how pleasurable traveling used to be thus rating is less than perfect but I need to admit that Lufthansa personnel makes all efforts to make the nuisances as painless as possible. New Airbus model touch screen entertainment -– simply the best and the easiest. especially the flight tracking!;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-05-17;LAX-FRA. Seats 45 B+C was poor with faulty design of folding tables. The rice and vegetables at dinner were overcooked Digestif service was too quick the bread rolls were served very cold and only on request. During the sleep / overnight period an night inadequate supply of drinks (2 times in the cabin to offer water only). There was no distribution of Toblerone. On our outward flight LH 452 all was great - 5 stars!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-16;A330 FRA-IAD business class. LH's business class product on this aircraft is unacceptable. I never thought I'd say United beats them in every respect - but on this flight they did. Angle-flat uncomfortable seat. Ridiculously clunky AVOD with poor selection. Food - geez. Bite size piece of veal. No easily accessible headphone jack? Seat barely worked - had to wiggle the switches back and forth many different ways to get the seat to recline. A failed experience in every respect. I had a fully flexible C class fare booked on UAL and to get home two hours earlier switched to this flight. While it was nice to see the family 2 hours earlier I was astonished at how poor this product is. I hope (and am sure) that the 747-8 and other newer airplanes are better - this thing needs to be retired.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-16;We have a good flight with Lufthansa. The staff was nice and entertainment good. We found some film in our native language. The only remark from my point of view is that on flight LH410 too many people ask the rice as hot food and when it will arrive my turn it has finished (should happen) but the staff remember at the second time to serve me first.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-16;Seat and display were not clean. The seat was very uncomfortable and even if I am only of average height there was not even enough space to cross or uncross my legs. I could not move around at all. Unfortunately catching some sleep under these conditions was not possible at all which is really bad for an overnight flight from Boston to Munich. Also the restroom was in really bad condition (thanks to fellow travelers who obviously do not know the basic rules of etiquette) I liked the touch screen of the inflight entertainment system which responded really well and delivered really good picture quality and the staff was really friendly as always.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-13;LH 422 and 425. Boston - Munich and Frankfurt - Boston. Improvement in staff: kind and welcoming. On the downside the entertainment program did not offer a wide range of movies selection is also difficult as it does not have a flexible menu. Meals are repetitive for frequent flyers.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-13;Brussels-Munich-Seoul. First flight excellent. Surprised to get a sandwich coke and tea on such a short flight. FA's very friendly. Munich to Seoul on the A340-600. Plane pretty old but well kept. Food was good: hot dinner and hot breakfast. Some FA's very friendly some pretty robotic. Poor entertainment system but still good enough to get me through the flight. Excellent value for money.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-13;LH414 May 10 2014. The flight was ok but here are some comments: Seat is not as comfortable as United Airlines. I liked that the amenity kit was event specific (soccer world championship). Many seats were empty in business class but I had a neighbour. The entertainment system is better now but there is still room for improvement. Too many old movies.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-12;The flight was 3 legs: flight from Tampa FL to Belgrade Serbia. These flights were operated by United (Tampa to Washington DC) and 2 flights on Lufthansa. Even though the system on both Lufthansa and United showed that I could do an online check-in within 24 hours of the first flight and select seats - I was not able to do so. Systems are just not connected even they market this as a Star Alliance. It is a shame that it is not possible to choose seats online and that systems are not connected within the alliance.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-12;VIE-FRA-HKG Business Class on an A321 then top deck on the new 747-800 with new business class seats. All flights on time. First leg acceptable although no IFE/moving map and food service was merely a tray of small but tasty canapes. On the flight to HKG must say that the new business class seats are very narrow and not particularly comfortable to sleep in. There's also no privacy screen between seats. Meals were acceptable although on both occasions my first choice was not available which I found strange being in the middle of a half-empty cabin. Service is functional/automated not very warm and cabin crew didn't appear happy to serve unlike SIA/Emirate/others. The IFE monitors were not sharp high resolution like onboard new Austrian business class. All in all would rate 6/10. Don't expect anything special it's not 4* service. LH's strengths are VFM and reliability so you can count on getting from A-B on time and a reasonable price if not in luxury.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-12;Just flew Munich - Sao Paulo on a A340-600. Flight was packed. Very attentive and nice cabin crew: I did ask for a sleeping mask was told it is meant for business class passengers. But I got one delivered 3 minutes later: very nice touch. Cabin crew almost all young men kept asking passengers if everything was fine. Food quality ok nothing special. Selection of movies on the IFE good but have seen better. The worst thing on this A346 was the seat: way too narrow to have some good sleep on this 12.50 hrs trip. Overall Lufthansa is still my number one choice when flying throughout Europe or to US/South America.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-12;The flight was 3 legs: flight from Tampa FL to Belgrade Serbia. These flights were operated by United (Tampa to Washington DC) and 2 flights on Lufthansa.

lufthansa;2014-05-11;On a direct flight Munich to Los Angeles I found myself in row 39 (economy class) of an aircraft with a downstairs bathroom area. The bathroom configuration is a great innovation but next to my seat loomed the very imposing cover for the stairway to the bathroom. Mine was the inside seat of only two in that row because of the stairway. My elbow bumped into the stairway wall and my vision was totally blocked on that side. Claustrophobic alley! A kind attendant was able to reseat me. Meals? The plane departed at noon and lunch was served at 1 pm. Lufthansa has been touted for its meals and I was looking forward to this part. The meal itself was good from my experience with airplane food. A few hours later an attendant passed out Toblerone chocolate bars. Several hours after that more chocolate bars. Mind you this was a direct flight. It landed 12 hours after it departed. The passengers had last eaten a meal 11 hours earlier! I think most people would need at least a sandwich or light meal in that 11-hour period. There were no meals for purchase on board no help in sight. I think Lufthansa definitely needs to look carefully at their meal policy for such extended flights. If I ever travel on this airline again I'm bringing my own food!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-11;LH 457 LAX-FRA: The design of the new Lufthansa first class (Boeing 747-800) is very good and the service was excellent. High quality standards!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-11;A330-300 was clean The staff was courteous the AVOD monitor with its Camera and gave a true picture of aircraft position and terrain. I like their Chanel 5 for Pop music.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-11;Third return flight with LH First Class product. This time MUC-EWR on board A 340-600 and back on 747-400 EWR- FRA. LH First Class is absolute perfection. From ground staff through flight service to after touch down. It's a completely different way of air travel. It's expensive of course but you know exactly what you're paying for. Besides that it's even better when First Class is an upgrade.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-11;We were scheduled to fly out of SFO on April 3rd UA1169. Then to Addis Ababa on April 4th: LH419. Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-10;DUS-EWR. Lufthansa has improved many things in the past which was also more than necessary nothing to complain on this flight crew was also unusual friendly. The new business class seats are another big improvement. Not yet top-class but I was quite happy with everything.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-08;May 5. Flight LH 430 from Frankfurt to Chicago. I was little bit disappointed because the TV did not work and the foods I wanted were out. But other than that services were good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-07;LH410 3rd May 2014. Good quality and price unfortunately the temperature of the cabin was too low. Several passengers required to increase the temperature to the crew without satisfaction. Low rating for seat comfort is related to this reason.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-05-06;FRA-IAH on 4/14 diverted to DFW due to weather problems in Houston. Arrived DFW around 4 pm was told only option was to take their chartered buses which did not depart until around 10 pm and arrived IAH around 0230. I understand the weather issue but my issue is with the compulsory bus ride when there are multiple flights between DFW and IAH. Why was another flight not an option?;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-06;We had two flights in business class from Malaga to Dusseldorf and then to Heathrow. The flights were what we always have (and expect) with Lufthansa. Flights are on time boarded efficiently smiling staff tasty food and a nice sized chocolate treat. Some of the passengers are grumpy and impatient. The staff from Dusseldorf to Heathrow April 12 were some of the best we've encountered. A great sense of humor. No inflight entertainment but there isn't on any of the short flights we've seen in Europe.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-06;I was travelling from FRA to ORD in economy class on board 747-8. Seat comfort was ok Wi-Fi working well most importantly flight attendants were nice they had good selection of beverages (incl. alcohol like whisky or cognac) ordered special food was really good. So we had good and smooth trip. Satisfied.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;Went First Class FRA-MIA on the A380 21st April. Excellent service on all levels. Comfortable seats low cabin noise - very pleasant trip. Went Washington - FRA on 26th on the new 747-800. A not so pleasant flight. It took two hours to get the inflight entertainment system to restart but service was good otherwise and the same type of seat in the A380. My preference although is the 747-400 with the first Class on the upper deck - much more space and more quiet.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;Several flights in April: Rome via Munich to Sao Paulo and back from Rio de Janeiro via Frankfurt to Nice. All Lufthansa operated. Consistent quality on all flights: All on time (some ahead of schedule) very professional and courteous employees on board. I don't understand why their cabin crews have a reputation of being cold and robotic. Not true at all. Very service orientated. Seats improved on long haul flights. I liked the new inflight touch screens like an ipad - easy to use large and better variety of movies. Food as always very good departing from Germany and only average from Rio. But beverage service (also alcoholic) excellent nice snacks like Milka chocolate bars in the galleys throughout the flight. Airbus A340-600 much quieter and nicer to fly than even refurbished 747-400 back from Rio. Munich airport simply great to transfer. Frankfurt new Z-area a great plus. Baggage handling despite short connexion time good. Always arrived with us. A great way to fly very recommended!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;YYZ-FRA-TLV on April 30. YYZ-FRA leg operated by an older 747-400 instead of the usual A340-600. Aircraft was refurbished and offered personal touch screens. seats were rather thin and uncomfortable for an 8 hour flight. I ordered a vegan (VGML) meal which included steamed vegetables and plain rice food was ok but lacked proteins and flavour dairy granola bar and margarine were provided which was annoying. Free beer wine and spirits were offered. Staff were courteous and professional. FRA-TLV leg was in a high density A321 seats were about 2 inches thick very hard and uncomfortable for the 4 hour flight. Food was surprisingly good and much better than the YYZ- FRA leg. No entertainment was offered. Service was extremely professional and courteous. Overall pretty satisfied and will definitely fly again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;LH 454 FRA-SFO 16 April 2014. LH 457 LAX-FRA 30 April 2014. Inflight entertainment and movie variety improved. Seat comfort is ok. No major difference to other airlines' economy. Staff service and friendliness is varying between employees. No consistency in friendliness and service. Food and beverage services take very long until guests are served. Breakfast is poor in terms of quantity content and quality. Just one additional beverage service after lunch/dinner. No sleeping masks provided.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;Departure LH 431 on April 16th and arrived LH 430 on May 2nd from Chicago O'Hare. Lufthansa had a Boeing 747 for this flight and it was great with individual TV’s for movie watching. Air hostesses had great attitudes and served with a smile. It was refreshing to see a good service throughout and made the long flight bearable. Only suggestion I would make is to provide more and better choices for movies. This is especially critical for long flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-05;"LH 419 from IAD to FRA April 30th. Good Airline in terms of flight schedule and punctuality. Seats are not as comfortable as could be compared to other airlines mainly on intercontinental flights. The recent changes in miles accrual has turned out into a price increase therefore the ""value for money"" index decreases.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-03;May 2nd 2014 LH 413. Excellent cabin service. However I was unlucky in getting one of those ancient First Class cabins with seats which should be in a museum. I think it is unacceptable to offer such a First Class product when many Business class seats of other airlines are way better. The usual new FC is good though but the old one must be replaced.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-03;Flew MAN-FRA-BOG round trip last week. Overall was I was impressed with Lufthansa and would fly with them again. IFE is good if a little dated. FA's are very professional courteous and friendly. They were helpful with every request that I or other pax around me had. The aircraft (B737 A346 and A320) were clean. I opted for the vegetarian meals and was impressed with taste and quality. My only gripe is the seat pitch in economy. Thankfully I had a spare seat next to me on FRA-BOG outbound otherwise it does feel a bit cramped for a 180cm person like myself. I would travel with Lufthansa again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-03;ABZ-FRA-TXL on 737-500 and A320. Lufthansa clearly stands out on European routes for me. 1) All classes include checked luggage and they are generous when it comes to weight limits (I had 28 kg no problem whatsoever). 2) Very generous bar service even between FRA and TXL (50 min flight time) they served drinks twice. There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-01;My wife and I took Lufthansa flights BOS-MUC-DRS on Apr 18 DRS-MUC-GDN Apr 22 and GDN-MUC-BOS on Apr 28. We were very satisfied with the service. All flights were on schedule. Our return flight to BOS arrived early. The check- in procedure was courteous helpful and efficient. Our interactions with all flight attendants was courteous and helpful. We feel safe and confident about flying Lufthansa and would gladly do so in future.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-01;Very positive experience. Only one major complaint: the distance between the rows of seats is very short. I am only 175 cm tall and weigh 65 kg but feel cramped in when the seat in front me is being reclined back I have no choice other than also tilt my seat back - even if I don't want to. Most other airlines provide better seating arrangements than I experienced on the flight LH 476 on April 28 2014.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-05-01;IAD-FRA LH 419 20/4/2014. New 747-8 reduction of engine noise - good. Seating - in view of economy class - good. Meals - breakfast lousy. Cabin crew - morning service started late no prompt to bring the seat back into an upright position for meals. Reaction time of inflight entertainment system very slow.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-30;LH456 and LH9242 on 10 April. Good product and Service - Shared flight with United Airlines was awful (not a thing I was looking for as I booked Lufthansa). Employees were most of the times quite nice. In-Seat-Entertainment in 747-800 works horribly (touch screen). Planes are cleaner than others from other airlines but still somewhat dirty - cleaning should do a better job and crew must check it prior to boarding.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-29;FRA-SFO LH454 13 Apr 2014. LAX-FRA LH457 25 Apr 2014. First class flight inbound: Seat was broken. System needed to get re-started 4 times during the flight then adjusted manually. Food: salad was unenjoyable. Main course (beef fillet) looked very good but was tasteless. Service onboard not first class at all. Slow and not attentive. Lounge LAX: great facilities. However very thin food offering. Business flight outbound: Entertainment system crashed 3 times. Old business class seats.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-28;LH 415 IAD-MUC on April 21 2014. This flight offered the cabin service as it used to be with friendly and attentive flight attendants which created a nice relaxing atmosphere. The inflight system was new and worked very well especially when comparing to the e.g. A380 (eco) which are terrible. Flight was very good however it all depends on the crew. I also experienced very bad and disinterested service (lately LH 462 A380 FRA-MIA on April 13 with unclean toilets right from the start and stressed personnel).;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-25;FRA-BCN 22 April Economy award ticket. This was an expensive (paying with miles) ticket from LJU to BCN. The first flight was on Adria and its new CRJ900 aircraft. FRA-BCN was on LH economy departure 4 mins before time bearding with 2 jetways to A321 which is very rare. Cabin crew were just regular. No special attention towards top tiers full flight basic food which included a small sandwich and a drink. Well groomed staff and maintained aircraft. Arrived (touched down) in BCN 6 mins ahead of schedule but lost 20 mins due to taxi and outside parking position even if a lot of gates were empty. Lufthansa is keeping itself above water saving even where savings are impossible charging more for taxes and lowering earning levels of Miles & More. After 25 years and complete dedication to LH I will not re-qualify for Gold status anymore.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-24;I flew flight 434 from Munich to Chicago (ORD) on their A340. The plane was new beautiful and the flight attendants were pleasant. I had the chicken with rice meal option and it was good. I enjoyed the white wine and the staff was very good about keeping the passengers' glasses filled with water juice or soft drinks. I had the calzone instead of the quiche for the snack prior to landing. It was only okay and I was disappointed that a fork and a knife were not offered with this option. The IFE (in-flight entertainment) options were adequate. During the flight I watched two movies and enjoyed the spa/relaxing music option. To summarize I had a good experience and believe I got good value for my money. I would recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-23;It has been a long-haul transatlantic flight in a new 747-8. The baggage drop security check flight and arrival have been uneventful and ok. The service onboard was good but not outstanding. After less than ten rows serviced the choice of meals was already reduced to one (pasta). The quality is comparable to supermarket convenience food and tends to be lower than in previous years - in variety as well as in general quality.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-22;HND-BRU via MUC 1st class A340-6 full plane in all classes. I am fond of LH but although very convenient HND airport check in was a mess even for 1st class had to wait more than 15 min computer problems staff lacking skills! Used ANA Suite Lounge - excellent! Boarding again messy. Once on board very efficient staff and professional purser. Food not so good and drinks very average. Since it was a day flight sleeping is difficult so watched a few movies and slept a little. Because the connecting time to the BRU flight was tight checked with purser and he assured me that someone was meeting me to go through all fast channels (ie passport control and security) but no one around made it on my own just before closing doors. Purser in short haul flight was apologetic as was check in gate staff. Excuses excuses and more excuses. All in all have the best European First class together with Swiss.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-22;LH 1147 Bilbao - Frankfurt March 31st 2014. LH 440 Frankfurt - Houston March 31st 2014. LH 419 Washington Dulles - Frankfurt April 11th 2014. LH 1142 Frankfurt - Bilbao April 12th 2014. Overall I have to say that I am satisfied with the airline. Lufthansa makes you feel comfortable on most of their trips. I value the professionalism of its workers. The only two issues they should get better are the entertainment onboard in economy class where you find fewer movies compared to other airlines and the new calculations for the mileage system in 2014 which makes it more difficult to retain or gain frequent flyer or senator status unless you spend more money.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-21;Flight LH415 Washington Dulles - Munich. Modern aircraft friendly staff very limited space in economy class Food so-so.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-21;FRA-SEA in business. Check-in was quick onboard a friendly crew and good service with tasty meal a snack half way and a warm snack before arrival. The new video system offered lots of choices. Seat was comfortable although I had the feeling they reduced the width compared to the old business seats.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-21;I flew business class on A319 from Frankfurt to Erbil and back then to Houston on A380. There was no business seats from FRA to EBL even though they passed it off as business class. Just the same as coach. It was a 4 hour flight. Absolutely dreadful! Then in business class on the A380 the seats do not go horizontal therefore I could get no sleep as my body was being pulled down.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-19;FRA-SIN-FRA on A380 in economy. Flight was cheap left/arrived on time and meals were fine but those were the only real positives. Fortunate to snag a seat with no seat in front so endless legroom. All other seats in economy looked ridiculously cramped. Seat itself was extremely uncomfortable for the 12 hour flight and the constant prodding of the touch screen from the passenger behind is a little annoying. (Unfortunately this is the only way to operate the screen as the remote is basically useless) Entertainment system would have been ok but crashed 3 times. Am Lufthansa 'Senator' status which helped in being able to secure one of the best seats (53D) other than that absolutely no recognition of so called status on board unlike Air New Zealand where one feels welcome pampered and valued - even though it is not my 'home' airline. All in all pretty sad for such a proud airline.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-19;Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-16;LH1233 on 16th of April from Vienna to Frankfurt. The overall flight was good and the flight attendants were friendly. We also got a small snack. The fact that there was absolutely no Inflight Entertainment was no problem due to the short flying time. The only things which disturbed me were that the flight was overbooked and that the online check-in didn't worked till I called the Lufthansa hotline. But all in all I would recommend Lufthansa and look forward for the next flight!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-16;Frankfurt to Dulles International Airport Washington DC on 13 April - even in economy class. It was such a contrast to the miserable United flight a week before - without doubt the most excruciatingly cramped and uncomfortable flight I have experienced. Seats on Lufthansa were very comfortable and crew outstanding with well- timed efficient food and beverage service. Loved the hot towel service! Only drawback was the frustrating in- flight entertainment system with sluggish touch screens requiring multiple attempts to activate and many movie selections which would not play. The seats were such an improvement over United's that I intend to fly Lufthansa whenever possible from now on even tho' I am a United Mileage Plus member.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-16;LH 418 on 9th April 2014. I was very satisfied with the overall experience on my Lufthansa flight although I would hope for a few additional movies on the inflight entertainment recent releases in particular. Staff were friendly and meal choices okay. Sometimes offers e.g. for Bailey's/Cognac after meals are only made upon request so you need to pay close attention when a flight attendant comes by. However compared to other airlines I've travelled with so far (e.g. Air France UA US Airways KLM Air Berlin) I'd rate Lufthansa higher than average.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-16;30 Mar 14 LH 408 Dusseldorf - New York / Newark. 6 Apr 14 LH 419 Washington Dulles - Frankfurt. Pleasant travel experience. Seats in Economy could be wider and more comfortable.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-15;Our flight LH439 DFW-FRA was very pleasant. Punctual and extremely comfortable. The stewardesses were very courteous and efficient. The special Asian Veg Meal was tasty. We look forward to our trip to Europe shortly.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-13;Brussels to Frankfurt business class March 25. Checked in at Zaventem at the First/Business Class counter with the most miserable agent I have encountered in 30 years of flying. No smile no eye contact no attempt whatsoever to welcome a paying customer. The agent really looked as if he hated every minute of his job. The flight itself was fine on-time with helpful stewards in a half-full plane.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-13;Frankfurt to Chicago April 1 outbound and returned on April 6. Good flight with the 747-8. Video system works well but slow to respond to touch commands.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-13;My first experience with Lufthansa was outstanding. I expect superior service in business or first class and I expect adequate service in coach/economy the Lufthansa staff from IAH-FRA and FRA-DXB (and back) were extremely pleasant and helpful - with a full cabin they were able to top-level service. I was pleasantly surprised that they maintained their pace for so long. The food was certainly better than most economy fare and the in-flight entertainment provided more than enough options to keep me occupied for nearly 40 hours of flight time on my round trip. I have come to expect average service when booking coach/economy and Lufthansa significantly raised the bar in this area. Now that I know about them first-hand I will look for their flights first when I travel.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-13;8 April 14 LH 008 HAM-FRA. Packed flight. Deadheading stewardess decides to dump her 2 (sizeable) pieces of luggage in the overhead bins above the emergency exits instead of taking her stuff to the back of the plane. Result: No space for paying passengers' luggage legroom can't be used (naturally) working stewardess had to rearrange a bunch of bags and coats and spread them throughout the airplane. Paying eco customers are rated lower than deadheads.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-11;LH418 on April 8. Overall trip was good - given the seat I had. Staff service was okay - although some more smiles would have been welcomed. Appreciated personal and named greetings from the chef de cabine coming to the Economy section - thanks to my M&M status. Food was okay. Could have been more appealing for the snack 2hrs before landing. A hot napkin before landing would be a plus. IFE is easy but does not show last movie releases and miss some more language / subtitles options.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-11;Flew LH490 on April 7 2014. I fly with LH about once a month on a round-trip that involves four segments. Service is always very good and on time performance excellent. New A330 interior in economy class is very convenient with a good entertainment system and ample leg room. I'm very pleased with Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-10;HND-MUC-ATH on A346. 24 hours before I checked in on a seat on emergency exit. I was surprised to find out that they had a different lay out so no extra leg room. Thankfully economy section 30% full so I jumped in the seat in front of the bulk. The seat was quite comfortable. Food and beverages quite good. On time performance. Now on the below par section. The cabin was extremely cold and the blankets were small and thin. Complaints made but nothing changed. IFE a bit old without remote control tough to navigate on a low resolution screen. A worn out touch screen with ok variety on movies though. Poor audio and the headsets completely useless. Cabin crew quite the opposite of ANA crew on my inbound FRA-HND. Actually robotic. No smiles no interaction. They served lunch 30 minutes after take off and then disappeared. Only one of them seated in the galley area with a tray of water and juice on a self service mode. After 9 hours they served a dinner box (again as in lunch there was a choice between Japanese and Western). Priority on my luggage was not honored in Athens as my suitcase came out after 20 minutes waiting on the carousel. All in all a below par flight from LH.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-10;"In the past years I have flown with Lufthansa mostly to collect miles but this year they reduced the miles for low fare economy flights from 50% to 25%! Why on earth would I still choose LH? Singapore Airlines has better service much better food more comfortable seats and same or often lower prices than LH. British Airways as well. Who was the genius to introduce this new ""saving"" policy at LH? Anyway they did not give much miles away. I feel like being punished because in the past I chose LH over other carriers.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-08;LH 418 on March 6 2014. Flight from Frankfurt to Washington DC. Very good service. Travelled with a handicap passenger and was treated very well. Helpful friendly staff not only during check-in but also throughout the flight. Had been afraid of travelling by myself with this passenger but Lufthansa-staff were there for me.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-06;I flew from Lyon to Frankfurt in Economy. The flight attendants were very friendly the food was okay and on this 1hr flight they served beverages 3 times! Check-in was good and the luggage was there before I was! A very nice flight with good service!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-06;LH761 New Delhi to Frankfurt 1st Feb 2014. LH400 Frankfurt to New York 1st Feb 2014. LH401 New York to Frankfurt 22nd Feb 2014. LH760 Frankfurt to New Delhi 24th Feb 2014. Good leg room great food above average service and a hygienic environment. The in-flight entertainment was quite a let down. All in all a brilliant airline. One of the best in Europe but no where near the Top 3 Airlines like: Singapore Airlines Qatar and Emirates. But probably one of the best Transatlantic Flights out there especially when travelling from India.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-06;I am shocked that LH is planning to do away with the Senator benefit of being able to reserve seating at time of booking. I need an emergency exit seat as I am very tall and LH has had my loyalty for the last 14 years expressly because of this reason. If they allow anyone to reserve the emergency exit seats at any time then why should a passenger remain loyal.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-02;"CCS-FRA-TXL and return aboard LH FirstClass in March. Inbound flight was excellent A330-300 with new FC. Check in in CCS was a 5 min thing very efficient and friendly. In CCS they use the AA Admirals Club for FirstClass lounge which was average limited drink selection no food not even snacks. Boarding was fast. Crew were nice and caring Seat was comfy but not as comfy as it looks. It's a lie flat where they put a ""mattress"" on but still quite hard to lie on but at least you can stretch out. Food was good but not outstanding. Transit in FRA is a mess CCS flights always got remote parking no gate! You have to climb off the plane get into Van take a 15min ride to Arrivals B then walk 30+ mins through Immigration customs on to Departures A. Senator Lounge at A Gates is like a luxury hotel full breakfast buffet smoking lounge showers full bar and great service. FRA-TXL leg is only 50 mins they put you in Business in lack of a First in these flights. Return flight was scheduled for March 27 but cancelled due to strike. They rescheduled my flight on the phone for March 28 no problem. TXL-FRA left at 6 am on time. Getting from Arrivals A to Departure C in FRA is disgusting. Endless walking (40+ mins) plus a trip on a train for people with moving limitations almost impossible to handle. Senator Lounge at C Gates very good but not as splendid as the one at A Gates I mentioned before. FRA-CCS decent service same food experience ( same menu) same good vodka same "" so-so"" seats. Nice inflight entertainment with large flatscreen good selection of actual movies and TV series. On time arrival in CCS very fast bag service with FirstClass bags unloaded first. Nice experience but not worth the money due to seats and food quality.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-02;LH 1770 29/3/2014. Two days ago I returned from Istanbul to Frankfurt and this was an example for what has become again standard. Plane was completely full passengers were greeted at the entrance door. Friendly and highly professional was the attitude of the 5 flight attendants. Meal service consisted of a warm dish (chicken with vegetables and wedges) a roll with butter rice pudding and a small bottle of water followed by two rounds of drinks. LH still has one of the most generous choices of free drinks non-alcoholic of any kind plus red and white wine sparkling wine beer etc. Announcements from the cockpit were short clear and informative. The cabin design was okay and clean. Due to the thin recaro seats space is sufficient even for larger people. Lufthansa is definitely on the rise again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-01;March 28 - departure point Luxembourg on LH6861 to Frankfurt continuing from Frankfurt to Dulles Int'l Airport (Virginia USA) on LH418. Other than for the unfortunate strikes which delayed my original flight plan I found the ground personnel and the flight personnel always helpful polite and very professional. I also appreciated having been warned at least 48 hours ahead of time regarding the strike. It gave me enough time to reschedule and change my itinerary. Lufthansa has always been regarded as a stellar airline. It would be regretful to demote its branding due to the strikes.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-01;Istanbul IST to Munich airport on March 25th at 6.25 am and the flight left on time and arrived early. The flight attendants were very friendly and the airline was very punctual. The return flight from Munich to Istanbul was just as good as well. Would fly Lufthansa again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-04-01;I was supposed to fly LAX-FRA-BLQ on April 2nd. Due to the pilot strike the flight was cancelled. After over one hour on the phone with the representative I was offered a free of charge rebooking for April 4th ironically the 3rd day of a well pre-planned strike. The representative knew less about the strike and the cancelled flights than I did! After that useless option was given I was offered a seat on the 5th which unfortunately by this time was making the entire trip pointless. I asked for a refund LH declined even if they failed to deliver their part of the transaction. Unacceptable I am a 15 years plus Miles and More customer I will now switch to a different airline.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-31;LH 429 CLT-MUC on 3/21/14 and LH 428 on 3/30/14. Great and friendly service new and clean airplane seats very tight almost no room for legs (for this price I expected more leg room wouldn't complain if LH was a cheap airline).;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-31;My preferred airline to keep my status (SEN). I like the fact that they welcome to you personally aboard as a senator. This was not done on this trip however. The next space in the economy is not all that great but that is probably true for most deadlines. What I do not like about Lufthansa is that they have greatly reduce their miles earnings on certain flights as of this year. If my chances to renew my status were further reduced I would probably look into other airlines more often as well. On this trip I had a nice seat in the exit row. Unfortunately I had a huge guy sitting next to me so it was all cramped in anyway. In addition the baby across the aisle cried the entire night however these are not Lufthansa's fault of course. The flight was on time even 20 minutes early.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-31;FRA-HKG in First. Like always an excellent experience from airport to inflight services. 747/8 very comfortable plane with beautiful cabin. Seats comfortable in every position. Staff great and sophisticated as usual. Food good but not top class. Champagne and wine left nothing to desire. Any time again!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-30;"LH754 FRA-BLR. 747-400. Excellent flight. Clean and comfortable cabin. Delightful service with a crew that actually cared about your level of comfort and needs. Food was way above standard for most mainline airlines. This was a second sector flowing on from a UAL connecting flight. The comparisons are beyond explaining. The UAL plane was a 777-200 ER. It was old dirty and basically a disgrace. The crew were in their old United way ""Perfunctory"". They had a job to do. Do it and get the passengers out of their hair. Hence when I look upon LH it is in direct comparison to the former flight. Where LH lost my vote was in baggage. They went on strike in FRA and my bags took two days to locate. The attempts to get it to me were lacking to say the least.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-30;"Flight from MUC to ORD Economy Class on Airbus A330 Windows seat at Emergency exit. Check-in online drop luggage at priority counter (Star Alliance Gold) was quick. Boarding on time (first time since a long time) priority boarding crowded but ok. Interior was the ""new"" Economy class with the latest Entertainment system. Seat is more uncomfortable than previous versions. Entertainment system: cannot plug-in headset unless monitor extracted - so not possible to use during take-off and landing (step backwards compared to old system). Selection of entertainment system was ok operation slow audio terrible (not loud enough). Food (pasta pizza) again poor quality. Service less frequent than usual with limited choice. Restrooms not very well maintained. Flight attendants not overly friendly for one this might have been her first flight so she was struggling (which is ok of course for the first time).";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-30;LH 419 IAD-FRA in Boeing 747-8. The Crew was friendly and the service good. The aircraft was immaculate. I booked a seat with extra legroom at an extra cost of 60€. The seat gave me ample legroom which was nice but it had no recline. Still a good travel experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-30;8/3/14 FRA-JNB LH 572 and 23/3/14 JNB-FRA LH573 (equip: A380). On the flight out the aircraft was clean but the seats were very hard and on the flight out the staff had a poor level of English (no manners). The worst part was the new inflight system the touch screen was poor at responding to input on both flights. Regarding food they only had pasta left by the time they had reached us. Highlight of going with Lufthansa was Ground staff. The worked hard in our personal needs. Overall half the price as BA but bring a soft pillow if you want to sleep.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-29;"LH457. The plane itself was modern with attractive entertainment system. Plenty of room for carry-on baggage improved seats in economy class interesting dim lighting during ""sleep"" time. However Los Angeles airport is missing information for passengers making it very difficult to find the proper terminal and gate even for advanced travelers especially for those who change their travel from domestic flight to the international one.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-28;22 Mar 2014 Washington to Frankfurt LH419. I was negatively surprised with very uncomfortable seats in new aircraft (747-800). They look stylish and although there was enough leg room (190cm tall) the seat was hard and not supportive for my back. Not many movies to choose from compared to some other airlines. Other than this everything was good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-27;"LH 490/491. My flight went smoothly. The crew were friendly and treated us well (for ""coach""). The entertainment system offered plenty of distraction. The food was correct (coach standards) but the choice was poor. On the inbound flight to Seattle we got twice the same choice pasta or chicken. Even if they were prepared and cooked differently it was the same choice. I believe it should be possible to offer a 3rd type of meal (fish or meat). Swiss remains my favorite and first choice however Lufthansa is and will remain my second choice.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-27;ORD-VCE LH 431 on March 18. Lufthansa Economy class is terrible. Courtesy comfort and service provided should be improved and they should add premium economy.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-26;LH431. Seats are terrible - the person behind you only has to touch your seat and it feels like a punch in the back. In addition when the person in front of you decides to use the reclining function it's almost impossible to move or get out of your seat. You have to follow suit in order to have some breathing space. A second glass of wine for dinner would have been nice.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-26;My 9.30 LH309 flight on 23/3/2014 out of Florence Italy was cancelled due to rain. Only one Lufthansa representative was available to rebook the entire flight's customers. After retrieving our luggage waiting in a long line to rebook through your only available representative in Florence we were to board a bus to take us to Bologna leaving at 13.00. It actually left at 14.15. No representative guided us with instructions on which bus to get on. When we arrived in Bologna one Lufthansa representative said to get into Line 35. When we approached the Lufthansa representative at Line 35 she got annoyed that we were in the wrong line. When I pointed out the gentleman who told us to get in her line she grabbed my ticket and approached that man. She came back without my ticket and told us we couldn't check in until 2 hours before the flight. Finally I got out of line and approached the man showed him my passport to get my ticket back. The meal voucher we were given in Florence was not honored in Bologna. Finally we got our baggage checked and seats assigned in Bologna 2 hours before our flight. When we arrived in Frankfurt no representative was there to greet us and walk us to where we were to get hotel vouchers. The whole experience was awful. Stress levels could have been lessened if Lufthansa people were well-informed and actually gave us correct information and were there to actually meet us and show us where or what we had to do. Walking around the airports in Bologna and Frankfurt with luggage on a wild goose chase because Lufthansa representatives didn't have a clue or gave us misdirection's was very bad mismanagement of customers and very poor customer service. I understand they cannot control the weather but Lufthansa CAN control the information given to customers after a cancellation and actually have representatives in place to guide us at each airport.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-24;I took a round trip from FRA to LAX for business. During the flight back the cabin was freezing cold. I was sitting in the rear part of the aircraft on the window side. The supplied blankets are completely ineffective because they are made of wide mesh kind of fabric that still lets the cold air pass through that is coming from the overhead ventilation slots. In the end I had to wear my winter jacket all the time. The lady next to me also complained and was sitting there with a thick winter jacket scarf cap and gloves.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-24;I flew on the new 747-8 from IAD to FRA. The aircraft was amazingly comfortable and the seats in Economy are definitely an upgrade from previous LH Eco-seats. Service was great and staff very friendly. Only downside is the PTV this is very slow and therefore can be annoying after a while. All in all this was a great experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-24;LH438. Flight and cabin service very good. Attendants very courteous and attentive. Food quality and selection seem to be downgraded from previous flights. Seat too small and uncomfortable (I am a small person). Space between seat in front very tight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-24;LH439. Flight and Service very good. Food quality and selection not so good. Seats much too small. Seat in front reclined much too far. Had to request passenger in front to adjust the seat forward so that I could eat and even get out of the seat during flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-24;Flying from the US I always would prefer a non-US Airline. I have been flying LH for quite some time but service and especially food has deteriorated. Since we prefer Airbus instead of flying Boeing we always used the connection via Munich. Maybe next time we will try either KLM or Air France provided we can chose those airlines both ways. We experienced the US airlines with very low standard: service/food/and seating.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-22;LH from ATL to FRA. Recaro business class seats on the A340 are not full lie flats but are still very comfortable. Dinner was surprisingly delicious and service was efficient yet not intrusive typically German I suppose. Major negative was the IFE screen which were small and washed out better to use my mobile phone than waste time with this relic from the 90's.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-03-21;LH 424 from Munich to Boston. Ground service good and fast Business lounge in Munich (with frequent flyer status) good but pretty packed. A330 in 2x4x2 Economy configuration and plane was packed to nearly the last seat. Despite this the cabin crew got 5 rounds of drink-service done after the main meal impressive and efficient. They were also very attentive and friendly. A negative point for Lufthansa's extreme cost cutting program as on both meals no choice available always only a single meal available which feels poor for an Airline with a claim of being a premium carrier.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-21;13/3/2014 LH 490. Nice and comfortable flight from Frankfurt to Seattle with a 3 seat row for myself.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-21;LH430 FRA-ORD on March 15th. Flynet was again not working. Toilets were awful after a few hours. Service personnel were very friendly. Water was dripping out of the A/C overhead after takeoff and before landing.;POSITIVE

Would definitely use again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-21;Even with high class tickets very poor mileage accrual in comparison to competing airlines. A340 new aircraft seats recline too much. Makes it impossible to work on laptop or exit your seat without asking the person in front to please go forward. This makes the flight terribly uncomfortable. Food is really quite poor. However I fly a lot with LH and the staff are always lovely. No shortage of beverages and smiles. Wide network and travel through good hubs. The lounges can vary some good some not so good. Overall if they stopped putting such a recline on seats and matched competitors on mileage gain it would be a lot better.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-18;Bangkok - Kuala Lumpur onboard Boeing 747-400. Flight was very nice comfortable and on time. Lufthansa should consider improving their IFE which works very slowly. It would be nice to receive more than just one sandwich. The was flight was nice comfortable and price was very affordable.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-18;First rate flight New 747-8 from Chicago to Frankfurt roomy seats even in Economy. Food quantity and quality has decreased. Beverage and hot towels service still rates high!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-18;Flight LH457 LAX-FRA First class. First class is a luxury. However some problems on the ground: The attendant at LAX lounge forgot to collect all the passengers when the flight was announced. Considering that the flight took off with a 1.5 hr delay and the transit time was 1h 45mins I expected some info from the cabin personnel about the feasibility to catch the next flight but nobody was able to give me an answer even though the question was put to them several times. I thought there would be somebody to meet me at the exit to bring me to the next flight nobody was there.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-18;Feb 22 LH 2531 LH 452. March 8 UA 1207 LH 431. March 9 LH 1444. I've been using this airline for almost 10 years now both for flights within Europe and for Transcontinental ones. I'm generally happy with the service the food is always good even in the economy class. Flight attendants are generally very nice and often seem to be happy with what they're doing.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-17;LH575 from Cape Town to Munich on Monday 10th March. Disappointed with overall service provided compared to price paid. Poor inflight entertainment drinks offered were few and far between and meals average at best.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-17;SKG-MUC A3 500. MUC-JFK LH 410. JFK-MUC LH 411. MUC-SKG A3 501. Lufthansa is the airline that me and my family members have been using in the last 20 years. I have been a member of the Senator Club as well. We prefer LH for obvious reasons such as security good service in air and on the ground kind and experienced personnel. Fleet with new and well maintained airplanes. In short Lufthansa satisfies most if not all requirements of most passengers.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-17;Travelled to India from Orlando (MCM) via Frankfurt on Feb 23 2014. It was a great experience. The front desk supervisors on that day helped me a lot and the flight attendants were good onboard. Overall it was a very pleasant journey.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-17;LH415 IAD-MUC. It's generally good. Food and leg space in economy is ok. What I didn't like this time was that they started to serve dinner at 23.40! We departed at 22.55.At that hour it should be dark and silent.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-17;LH 429 CLT-MUC. Everybody was very friendly the only thing I did not like: I had a reservation for 2 seats (window/aisle) since last June. The day we took our flights (March 11th) we learned that our seats did not exist anymore and that we had new seats in the middle of a row of four! As we protested we got two new seats in the back of the airplane at least two seats on the aisle. Why did nobody tell us as soon as the reserved seats were not available anymore? I think Lufthansa should not treat customers like that.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-13;FRA-BKK v.v. First fully booked on both flights so the service was a bit slow. A340-600 with old seats but comfortable enough for a good sleep. F&B excellent with caviar service and outstanding wines. IFE with not many options small TV screen. Two FA's very friendly but for 8 pax LH should deploy more staff. All flights on time overall good value for money. But I found out shortly that LH will not offer F to BKK any longer from summer onwards.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-11;The flight from Paris to Tbilisi via Munich. Both flights were just excellent. Very efficient check-in and boarding in Paris. Both aircraft's were very clean with informative updates from the pilot. Seats are actually very comfortable in comparison with low cost airlines. Paris-Tbilisi route offers excellent hot food (I had very tasty chicken) as well as the full bar service. One important fact which is important to highlight. I had short connection (45 minutes) in Munich and the plane departed half hour late from Paris. I thought that I would miss the plane to Tbilisi and the big surprise was that the ground staff was waiting for me and transferred from the plane to plane. This is excellent service and deep appreciation to Munich airport and Lufthansa ground staff!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-11;Departure from Charlotte to MUC-VIE: 10 Dec 2013 on LH 428. Return from Vienna to Charlotte via MUC: 6 March 2014 on LH 429. I travel regularly between the USA and Europe and I choose Lufthansa every time if it is available. The airline is reliable and consistent. Their staff both on-board and on the ground are considerate and helpful.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-11;Feb 23 LH412. Feb 28 LH429. Generally good service good planes well operated - Miles & More starts to become an issue. No general rewards hard to achieve status service drastically declines without status.;POSITIVE

lufthansa;2014-03-10;TXL-FRA/FRA-TXL. Both flights on time nice staff high quality food which was nicely presented. LH's domestic business product is far better that the long-haul one. Flaws: no Wifi and IFE whatsoever.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-10;FRA-EZE/EZE-FRA. Flights on time staff pleasant. Old Business Class: seats a nightmare IFE problems on both flights FlyNet not working on any leg food appalling. No taking of orders. You get your courses from the food cart which stores loads of plates under aluminium foil lids. My companion got a VLML special meal main course on return flight: pasta with tomato sauce and cheese! Cheese stuck to the lid and was transferred on the pasta using a cocktail stirrer. Dessert: five slices of fruit served together with main course. White wine out of stock after starters. Service uncoordinated. It was a disgrace and I was ashamed for our German flag carrier.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-10;Flight LH419 Dulles Intl - Frankfurt Intl 25/3/2014. As I am part of the Miles & More programme I prefer to fly Lufthansa. On my last flight I was looked after well the flight left on time and landed early and I was able to choose a seat with extra leg room which is important for me.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-07;LH435 ORD-FRA. Very comfortable the highest standard of services on board. On time despite the snowy weather in Chicago. There was only one issue - prior to LH flight I flew from SLC to ORD (LH codeshare operated by United Airlines) - the worst quality I have experienced.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-07;LH428 on 3/5/14. Great crew good meals provided as well as in-flight entertainment. The only thing I would add is that it would be extremely convenient to be able to pay for additional baggage on-line like other airlines do.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-07;LH 411 2 March. My seat was in the first row on the aisle. Due to the service it was not possible to stretch my legs for a long period of time. After the flight I still had pain in my back. The onboard service was not very satisfying and the meal served was not really edible.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-06;3 flights with Lufthansa inside Europe. All on time and reliable. Seat in Economy is quite firm but OK for a short period of time. I got bored of the sandwich after the first one but then got the identical one twice more so I gave it away. Staff were friendly and the coffee was good. The Senator lounge in Munich was excellent as were the lounges in Manchester and Luxembourg. No in-flight entertainment so bring a book or read the paper. A very solid product.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-05;Arriving to Washington DC Dulles Airport for my flight to Croatia via Frankfurt Airport I was offered special care due to a lower back injury that severely hampered my physical movement. From the US through Frankfurt Airport and upon arrival in Zagreb Croatia I was offered friendly transit support at each and every stage. I have made this flight over 100 times and despite the pain associated with my injury I must say that this was the most satisfying travel experience I have had in over 30 years of international travel.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-04;LH 419 departure on Feb 27 2014. I flew with Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Nice clean and very new plane. I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class). For an overnight flight it is recommendable to aim for a exit row seat since you cannot stretch your legs and the arm rests are firm. The meals and beverages/drinks provided were all very good and did meet my expectations. Getting on and off the plane was fast and efficient. All in all still a satisfactory experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-04;Lufthansa flight 493 from Vancouver to Frankfurt on March 2nd 2014: I was impressed with Lufthansa's service in coach class. Tasty meals and a great variety of free beverages and snacks offered throughout the flight. Cabin staff was very cheerful and approaching even though it was a full flight with some quite challenging passengers around me.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-04;"LHR-MUN-PEK-FRA-LCY. My 5th London - Beijing flights with Lufthansa within 2 years and I have to say the quality is stable and consistent as well as good value for money. For both the outbound and inbound paths the flights are on time if not slightly early during the long haul flight several water runs during the night and the staff are the biggest assets providing the friendly efficient and professional services. During the flight between PEK and FRA the new Boeing 747-800 was used it offered the personal power socket and free WIFI onboard which is extremely good value. The only slight drawback is that you can not select seats on the exit rows online and airport check in as they are ""occupied"" however when on board you realised that half of them are empty.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-04;LH 419 departure on Feb 27 2014. I flew with Lufthansa's new 747-8i. Nice clean and very new plane. I was seated in the main cabin in row 16 (first row in coach class).

The meals and beverages/drinks provided were all very good and did meet my expectations. Getting on and off the plane was fast and efficient. All in all still a satisfactory experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-04;LH464 from Frankfurt to Orlando in Business Class with our infant (12 weeks old). Check-in in Frankfurt for family's was very good due to extra check-in counter. Service onboard and the food was ok. Nice wine collection and space for my legs.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-03;SIN-FRA-BHX in Economy. First leg from Singapore on the A380 was great largely because I was fortunate enough to get an exit row seat with unlimited legroom (judging by fellow passengers one wouldn't be happy with normal seats as they had rather pathetic legroom). Nice modern AVOD system but the PTVs were rather small compared to other A380 airlines. Service was really friendly and warm but few frills (no amenity kit whatsoever no footrests). Meals were alright but again rather simple compared to Asian carriers. Second leg to Birmingham on an A320 was above average by intra-Europe standards with a decent snack/beverage service and friendly service again. All flights on time.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-03;"Flights LH720 and LH721 from FRA to PEK and back. Everything written regarding the Lufthansa business class seats is absolutely true. Outbound flight on new 747-8 with new business class seats which are flat beds. Unfortunately if you are satt near the window in flat bad position it is almost impossible to get out of the ""bed"" without disturbing your co-passenger. On top your feet are very squeezed in the tiny hole at the bottom of the bed. Food choice OK as well as beverages. IFE system I would rate as average. Flight on time. Inbound flight - nightmare instead of 747-8 it was old 747-4. As I checked in online nobody at the counter mentioned that the plane was changed and consequently my seat. Departure late for more than an hour. Old business class seats which are a disaster if you have the idea to sleep during the flight (not flat bed and very uncomfortable). Entertainment system was not working for more than two hours of the flight as needed to be reset. Food on the same level as outbound flight. No soap in the toilette. At the end arrived on time to catch my connecting flight. Overall will use them only if I have to otherwise for the same or lower cost other ME airlines and even the airlines from the Lufthansa group are offering much more for the same buck.";NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-03;LH457 LAX-FRA 26/2/2014. Service OK seats in new 747/8 are very bad with not enough space! Food was good beverage service not satisfying!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-03-03;The LH 411 flight from JFK to Munich was in total a very comfortable one. The service was much better than expected.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-28;Flight from Frankfurt to Singapore. Great value for money. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment could be improved for instance a more modern and larger movie selection as on other competing airlines. Considering that the flight was 180 Euros cheaper than Singapore Airlines I was very satisfied.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-26;LH456 FRA-LAX 21 Feb 14. Great trip with LH new aircraft nice and enjoyable/humoristic crew. Nothing to say on the service although the seats do need an upgrade it does not contribute to the full experience as the entire flight overall is good. The entertainment system (AVOD) is easy to use although late responding but with a good selection of films music and travel information. Overall a very nice experience and flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-25;EWR-MUC 19/02/2013 LH413. My travel experience was great. From check-in to lounge and boarding it was very smooth and easy. The flight itself was relaxing food and drink was excellent and the staff very friendly. In the end we were even 30 minutes ahead of schedule. I wish flying would always be like this experience.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-25;"LH410. Not having much space these day in normal economy class with 6'6'"" height it is nice to know that is still possible to get the emergency exits. Service is good and very friendly.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-25;LH 428 on Feb 16 2014 from MUC to CLT. Flew First Class - very attentive friendly service. Insufficient movie selection in comparison to other airlines. Entertainment system often malfunctioning so in this case no service call or reading light activation possible.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-25;Disappointed with the recent Buenos Aires to Frankfurt flight. Several crew members seemed rude and unmotivated when an elderly lady boarded with a light and small suitcase the flight attendant refused to help her stow it away. Other occasions the crew were not helpful: to a family travelling with small children removing food plates instead they walked over it and complained about it. Other than that service was been ok flight attendants served passengers with water and juice several times during the night in addition to the self-service bar area with small snacks and beverages. Dinner was ok breakfast was very disappointing. Unfortunately there are not many alternatives on this route. However on the outbound journey the crew both on ground and on board were much nicer and all flights were on time.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-24;Early-morning feeder flights from to Frankfurt and back outbound on a brand new A320 return on an older plane with newish cabin. The core product is rather basic both in terms of comfort and services but the planes were spotless the crews extremely professional and the slimline seats at least provide decent legroom. LH still serves nice breakfast and drinks even on these short hops and there is really nothing major to complain about. One thing to improve is seat assignment in economy which tends to get really messy at times.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-21;Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good. The inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies in various languages (sadly variety was not that great) the flight attendant were generally nice. We would recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-20;Feb 18 2014: Lufthansa - LH1817 - Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC). This segment was part of a five flight itinerary with United Airlines a review of which can be found under their name. This particular Lufthansa experience was as always superbly efficient on the ground in both Barcelona and Munich. Navigating airports at either end was a breeze and the embarkation and disembarkation process easy and smooth. The flight itself had both an on-time departure and arrival and the in-flight service was as expected superb and efficient as one would expect from Lufthansa. Always a treat to fly with Lufthansa and will continue to do so whenever possible.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-20;LH 410 MUC to JFK 1st Feb 2014. The flight was fully booked but it was ok. Crew very friendly. Since I was sitting at rear I had only one meal left to choose. The space for my feet was very limited because of some mounted housings under the seat in front. Too little space to place something like a bottle of water and a book. Plane was new and in good shape.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-18;Flight 457 from Los Angeles to Frankfurt was delayed due a technical problem. Unfortunately there was no assistance for me at the arrival gate since my flight connection was half an hour later I had to rush pass again through the security check and immigration. I arrived breathless at the gate of my flight to Florence where we were told that they had to change the aircraft due to a technical problem. I had to wait for another hour. Concerning the service on board and the aircraft (a new B747-800) I have nothing to complain about.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-18;LH431 from ORD to FRA. These long haul flights now have wifi which was a pleasant surprise. Apart from that the cabin was not particularly full which made it easy to put the bag under the seat next to me etc. I suspect the comfort would be diminished if it was otherwise. Apart from that no other surprises the food was good the staff polite the flight was on schedule.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-17;ORD-FRA-DEL. A typical mixed bag of service. ORD-FRA was supposed to be on 747-8 and I booked this flight specifically for this aircraft but they downgraded to normal 747 in the last minute. This caused chaos in ORD as they were short 16 business class seats all passengers had to be reassigned their seats which caused my family to be split up and in middle seats - at several thousand dollars each we were not happy. Crew tried their best but no one would move and we were seated all over the cabin. Food was mediocre at best on this route and angled seats did not provide for great sleeping. Entertainment a joke when compared with new United system or with EK/SQ with basically 10 movies 3 of which were >10 years old. FRA-DEL on 747-8 and much better with much nicer crew and flat seats. Departure time from FRA is not ideal as arrival is at 2am compared to 10.30pm with other airlines. Arrival at DEL was a mess with business and first class bags off-loaded last which annoyed premium paying passengers. Only highlight really was LH Senator Lounge in FRA which was very nice. For the price paid I would try another carrier.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-14;LH418 FRA-IAD 8 Feb. It was a rather comfortable flight in a not too fully booked Economy Class cabin. My major issue with this flight was about the internet connectivity on board. Unfortunately again FlyNet did not work at all. It has become a rather unreliable service over the last few months. Seating comfort on the new 747-8 is rather good nevertheless when someone sits next to you in Economy it is really a challenge to survive a long-haul flight. The distance to the front seat could be improved but most likely will not. Again I have to point out that as a Lufthansa status customer (Frequent Traveller Star Alliance Silver) I am being treated better by United (complimentary upgrade to Economy plus priority boarding priority luggage) than by Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-14;LH418 Feb 9 2014. As a frequent flyer (and holding Senator status with the Star Alliance) I prefer to fly with Lufthansa and its Star Alliance partners as they offer me the best routes to get me to my destination. On every flight I experienced good service the crew handled any extra requests with a smile.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-13;LH 429 Jan 31 2014 CLT to MUC. LH 428 Feb 8 2014 MUC-CLT. The service is excellent the crew polite and nice. No significant delays. Food is reasonably good for airline food. We certainly wouldn't choose a different airline to cross the Atlantic.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-12;I flew from Philadelphia to Frankfurt. Plane was old Airbus A340-300 interior being in clean and good shape. Business having own check-in was nice staff being polite except supervisor having an argument with a customer at next counter. Almost better than real TV. For Business Class passengers there was own boarding lane. At Cabin boarding drink with choices were offered. Business class has lie flat seats but not latest fully flat yet. According to my knowledge Lufthansa is installing new fully flats on their fleet. During flight the service was nice first with cocktail and snacks. 15min later came food service with appetizers with choices. From three warm choices you can choose your main course. Wines were good and I slept rest of the flight comfortably and missed breakfast service.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-11;LH 435 ORD-MUC 2/6/2014-2/7/2014. Good flight. I was lucky that the seat next to me was empty so I had more space. Otherwise the seat would have been really small. Service staff friendliness punctuality were all better than on previous flights with other airlines.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-07;LH 457 from LA to Frankfurt Boeing 747 - Seat 35H: There was no space for my feet under the seat because there was a metal box under the seat in front of 35H. For a long distance trip this is not acceptable!;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-05;"Frankfurt-Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt booked a special for 429 Euro in September flew in January - a 6 day trip. Excellent value for money. New A330 cabin with improved seats in economy class and brand new wireless inflight entertainment system which means no more entertainment box under the seats and therefore more legroom. System with good responsiveness high definition and you can even use your own headphones (""one plug""-system). Flight information system with satellite views is great! WIFI on board for extra cost available on most time of the flight. Staff service as always on Lufthansa efficient friendly correct and professional. Meals decent (1 hot meal 1 sandwich service) wide range of free (even alcoholic) drinks friendly welcome in the galley for more drinks. Hot towel service is always welcome. Only organization of boarding in Abu Dhabi should be improved too narrow waiting lounge for two flights at the same time. Both flights ahead of schedule.";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-05;LH 435 Chicago - Munich. January 30 2014. Nothing to complain about flight was on time on board service in general was good however the only point I can complain about is that breakfast could have been better. I suspect that the reason for the quality of breakfast below what one could be expect from Lufthansa is that on flights from the US to Europe catering is done by a US company hence the quality of bread is quite poor.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-04;As a very regular customer of Lufthansa I am normally a fan and very happy with the service they offer and provide. Unfortunately my last flight: Frankfurt/Los Angeles (LH 456) was an exception. Having been offered a complimentary upgrade to Business Class at the gate I was then downgraded on board back to Economy with minimal apology nor effort to find a suitable alternative. (I understood the issue as the Business Class seat had in fact been sold to a passenger on Business Class standby but given my status and the value of business I give LH every year it was disappointing). On this occasion the situation was made worse by a particularly difficult neighbor and some average service on board. As I said not a normal experience with Lufthansa but frustrating all the same.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-04;1st class on FRA-EZE-FRA Boeing 747-400 with only 8 seats which are a rather good option - chair plus bed aside. Service is good but not excellent. Choice of and beverages is just ok. Have travelled them before a few times with this configuration and it is to my liking although not a suite is as good as! Skilled staff but oldie planes. Check in disastrous on all occasions lounge in FRA splendid in EZE and Sao a disaster! Not as good as flying Swiss international.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-03;Sao Paulo to Frankfurt and on to Madrid. Checked in for my flights and was treated in a courteous and friendly manner. Chaos at Guarulhos due to the construction work ahead of the World Cup. Our gate remained occupied by a TAP A340 with a delayed departure leading to being bussed to our 747 parked at a remote stand. Pushed back from the stand about 1.5 hours late and waited in a long line for take-off. Nice reception on-board and seated in a center aisle with the middle seat free. The service was excellent and the food of a decent quality with the usual drinks and wine of your choice. I have to say that I find the LH business class seat lacking in comfort and as it doesn't go flat is quite hard to find a comfortable sleeping position. It is time for a revamp of that seat. The entertainment selection is good and I particularly like one of the radio channels. Headsets are decent but not up to the Bose quality used by other carriers. This is an 11 hour flight so plenty of time to relax. Breakfast was good and I find the cabin crew to be of a consistently high standard. Fix that seat and this is a very competitive product.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-02-03;I took the flight to Orlando from Frankfurt and back from Charleston to Munich. Sufficient space in Economy. There could be some better variation in food selection. Free drinks is much appreciated. Inflight entertainment could do with a wider selection of recent movies.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-31;LH457. Departure and arrival on time. Confusing boarding practise in Los Angeles. Narrow seats not comfortable. Meals on board OK. Service average - recommendation only if LH is less expensive than competitors (Singapore Airlines / Emirates).;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-31;26/1/2014 LH 438 Frankfurt - Dallas. Very dedicated service and personnel when the cabin is not full service becomes slow when Fist Class is fully booked as there only is one person serving. Great Food and wine section and good media service. Still too many planes around which have the old setting in place not on the last trip which was great.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-31;Boston to Munich LH425. Reliable friendly in-flight and check-in staff. Poor SMS system for flight updates. One SMS informs customers that the flight is late another one about 1.5 hours later told customers the flight will be on time. When arriving at the airport it was late again. They are still doing averagely when it comes to pampering of their top status customers. There is hardly ever a complimentary upgrade while my US colleagues on US carriers get upgraded 75% of the time on long haul flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-29;LH429 CLT-MUC A330: Flight very cold but service food and beverages ok. New Policy for Miles a little bit complex for economy class: too many classes and you can't select the right one when you book a flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-29;LH419 January 23. Washington to Frankfurt. Plane was half empty so it was a very smooth and quiet ride. Always pretty satisfied with the efficiency of Lufthansa although they could improve the quality and seating space.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-28;HEL-MUC/FRA-MAD return. I don't like their new loyalty program downgrade. I booked quite high priced booking class ticket last year hoping to earn more miles and to renew my Frequent Flyer status and loyalty with them just to be faced with the fact that earning miles is now 25% - 50% from mileage flown unless you pay full Y or C priced ticket. 23hrs check in before flight is useless 3 of my 4 flights were of change of equipment and I was automatically moved from reserved first Y row seat to the last rows of the bus. Very inconvenient as I had to wait a long time to get deplaned. Their onboard product has downgraded with NEK seat. 2 x 2hr 20min flight segments resulted me back muscle pain. Seat is so thin and narrow making noises when moving on it it is the most uncomfortable way to travel. Their refreshment offering is okay but snacks are inedible - no healthy and fresh options anymore. Cabin crew did their best service was professional with smiles. Lounge access was good as layovers were 3hrs 30min too long. Loyalty for this airline is completely useless for me I will change my loyalty to another Scandinavian carrier with better timetables.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-28;Flight Abu Dhabi-Frankfurt: new business class seats on this night flight an absolute improvement compared to the old seat that is still in use. Wish all Lufthansa long haul seats in this class were already installed! Service on board really friendly and chatty. Nice snack and aperitif after departure good breakfast 1 hour prior to arrival. Could have been served 15 mins earlier but at the same time crew allowed us to sleep longer. Inflight entertainment improved as well a lot. The map/route should have music in the background. The new seat is perfect to sleep completely flat. Amenity kit is a plus. Smooth flight and professional service. A330 10 years old but in perfect condition. Welcome lounge in Frankfurt a nice place to have a shower and another great breakfast after this night flight.;POSITIVE

Wish all Lufthansa long haul seats in this class were already installed! Service on board really friendly and chatty. Nice snack and aperitif after departure good breakfast 1 hour prior to arrival. Could have been served 15 mins earlier but at the same time crew allowed us to sleep longer. Inflight entertainment improved as well a lot. The map/route should have music in the background. The new seat is perfect to sleep completely flat. Amenity kit is a plus. Smooth flight and professional service. A330 10 years old but in perfect condition. Welcome lounge in Frankfurt a nice place to have a shower and another great breakfast after this night flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-28;Flew CGN-MUC on a Saturday. Onward flight was nearly empty so you could seat any seat. Two drinks one coffee and one apple juice on a nice Airbus 321. Return flight on the same day was packed so all bins where overloaded. It took ages to board. Got drinks as well crew did a good job for a 55 minutes flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-28;I travelled flight LH456 on Saturday 18th January from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. It was extremely cold on this plane due to some problems with the air-conditioning (seat 33H). Other passengers seated in rows in front of me were complaining as it was too hot on their seats! This must be a major problem and to be honest I was very dissatisfied with this situation. The flight attendants did a great job.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-25;LH430 FRA-ORD Jan 20 2014 New 747-8. Seat comfort is inferior to most other airlines on this segment. Loyalty customer treatment (especially in regards to complimentary upgrades) is unacceptable seems non-existent all the way up to Senator (incl.) and might become real only with HON which is super exclusive. Food quality is average and staff attention in economy is also just average. Staff attention visibly improves from business class onwards. Inflight entertainment is a bad joke especially in economy as well as in any 'old' business or first class seat. Tiny monitors that are often defective. Fairly small movie selection. This is way behind the other airlines that LH wants to compete with. Economy seats in the new 747-8 are ok but seat comfort in the first economy aisle seat right behind business class is impacted by staff continuously pushing the blinds against the passengers legs.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-22;Flight DUS-MUC in the evening. Short flight from DUS to MUC. Friendly staff free Drinks (water tea coffee wine bear soft drinks) and savory snacks. We left on time and reached MUC about 20 min early.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-22;Frankfurt - Rio de Janeiro - Frankfurt with Lufthansa on A340. On time smooth decent hassle free and without any problems. Extremely friendly professional and attentive crew on both flights. Cocktails served after take off really nice dinner. Large movie selection on personal screens. 2-4-2 seats making it easier for a couple to sit together. Absolutely nothing to complain if there was not the seat itself: Narrow uncomfortable and one of the worst of all my flights. Unfortunately different from other airlines economy seats.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-22;LH428. Positives: Smooth trip to U.S. Good service nice entertainment program nice food and drinks. To improve: Seat was in the last row of the plane and I didn't had so much space for my legs.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-22;LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible. I see two main problems - the system is outdated and not properly serviced. However this was a smaller problem for me compared with the failure of the promised Wi-Fi connection.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-22;Frankfurt (FRA) to Washington Dulles (IAD) LH 418 on December 9 2013. Space comfort in economy class is not great there should be more space! The entertainment program quality was not great it appears to me that mainly only old films are shown in economy class not quite sure if this has something to do with cost savings. I don't understand the beverage concept of Lufthansa I wish there was more non alcoholic beer on board.;NEGATIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-21;It's always a pleasure flying with Lufthansa. The flight LH 490 was ready on time for departure and the crew aboard welcomed all with a smile. The aircraft was new and cleanliness in the cabin was satisfactory. This time there was no aerobridge and the boarding was via bus. This added to a bit of inconvenience to some passengers. The new Airbus cabin storage is comparatively small and passengers had to struggle finding a place to put their carry on luggage. Overall the food and beverages selection was good. I would highly recommend this flight to my family and friends.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-21;The flight (LH431) was as expected good. The chosen seat was good for my long legs. Departure and Arrival was nearly on time. Only the served breakfast was very poor.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-20;Flight LH430 was perfect. New Business class seats are really good and comfortable. I've received the upgrade from the economy with no additional costs. Entertainment was ok but sleep on the plane was better and the traveler kit was very helpful. I'll do it again.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-17;Dec 21 2013 LH431 ORD-FRA. Efficient and friendly service. The new 747-8 aircraft offers a modern ambience in the Economy class LH standard seats with individual now well-functioned entertainment system but still the usual limited space.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-16;London LHR - Frankfurt. Quick 1 hour flight. Friendly enthusiastic and chatty crew sandwiches offered and full bar service incl. German sparkling wine and bottled beer even in Economy. All on time perfect.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-16;ORD-MUC LH 435 Jan 11th. Great Service Food is ok but the inflight entertainment system is pretty bad. Movie selection is rather small and the touchscreen is so unresponsive its a pain to navigate the menu.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-16;LH 415 Washington-Munich. 10/11 Jan 2014. Overall very good. Friendly service. Good (new) business class seats. I was surprised that I did not get entry to the Star Alliance Lounge at Washington airport even though I had a business class ticket and being FTL silver.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-16;DOH-FRA-YVR: Both legs of flight on A340 aircraft. Not my optimum choice of long-haul platform. however Lufthansa really made the best of things. Traveled economy both legs yet found that both seat space and leg room were more than adequate. Food was so-so and selection of movies average. However cabin crew were very attentive and customer oriented. This airline is becoming my airline of choice.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-14;FRA to ORD. I slept most of the time on board so there was not much I had to complain about. Flight attendants very nice and friendly. Boarding in FRA is always very chaotic. It is much better organized in ORD. LH should handle the boarding procedure for FRA like they do it in ORD. I'd recommend that Lufthansa would send an e-mail notification when the plane changes so that passengers who book early can make sure that they can keep their reserved seat.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-14;Frankfurt to Washington Dulles on Jan 8 flight LH418. Return on Jan 10th flight LH419. I have been flying Lufthansa for many years now both professionally and privately. It is not a cheap airline but I admit that I still use it for my private trips because of the impeccable quality of service at all levels. As a Senator passenger I know I get more perks but I see all the time the genuine attention that the staff puts in when dealing with every passenger. After having delt for many years with numerous american airlines I find this very refreshing!;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-13;Flight 490 from Frankfurt / Germany to Seattle / WA on January 6 2014. Very punctual smooth flight. On board service very good. Temperature in plane too low. Entertainment programme and internet service excellent. Digital flight information very good. Meal service fine except for oversight to remove moist cloth and empty cups/cans before serving dinner. Overall impression very good.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-13;30 December 2013 Paris to Tbilisi via Munich LH2237 and LH2556. 8 January 2014 Tbilisi to Paris via Munich LH2557 and LH2230. Check-in was easy and pleasant with brilliant ground staff in Tbilisi. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working especially on the MUC-TBS leg on 30 December. Hot food was served in MUC-TBS-MUC segments and it was very tasty both times. Lufthansa and Turkish are recommended airlines for travelers to Tbilisi.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-13;Manchester UK to Munich LH 2501. Munich to Chicago LH434. I travel with Lufthansa regularly from Great Britain to USA in either Business or First Class. The overall service is always excellent. I can fly directly to the USA from Manchester (UK) but the standard and service of the US Airlines is way below that offered by Lufthansa. Meals are always excellent seating extremely comfortable and cabin staff courteous and helpful. Travelling via Germany adds to my journey time but I find it well worthwhile. Additionally the standard of Lufthansa Lounges are far superior to US Airline ones.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-10;VCE-FRA-AMS on 28 December 2013 and then AMS-FRA-VCE on 3 January 2014. Flights were all nice and all on time on comfortable A321 and A319. It didn't make sense that they gave us food on 16:35 pm flight to AMS and not on 12:45 pm flight to FRA but this is just an insignificant detail. Staff was good and smiling and flight experience was good too. I recommend Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-09;LH457: I was quite satisfied with this flight. Stewards and stewardesses were friendly food was of good quality and entertainment offered was very good. My 5 year old daughter enjoyed the cartoons. I would suggest that if seats are available travellers with children could be positioned in the plane so that they can be given an extra seat so the child can sleep better. Of course if the flight is full I understand that this is not at all feasible.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-09;"Flight LH434 from Munich to Chicago was a real pleasure. Smooth ride and super crew - friendly and professional. I could feel that customer satisfaction was the utmost priority and that the team was ready to fulfil all requests even if out of the ""standard protocol"".";POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-08;IAD-FRA on B747-8 and FRA-IAH A380. Both flights were good. Friendliness in Business is much better than Economy. Good food and Service on both legs. Lounge in IAD with separate access gate to the plane is a plus. The new Business on the B747-8 let the old one on the A380 feel really outdated. It was hard to get a seat in the Z-Gate Business Lounge in FRA.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-08;LH 456 on January 4 2014. The flight from FRA to LAX was delayed 2 hours at take off due to first a technical problem and second an ill passenger whose luggage had to be removed from the airplane. At arrival the plane was only one hour late because of a higher cruising speed the plane was rather new (747-8) and comfortable the food was good - quite a positive surprise on a trans-atlantic flight. Only the cabin temperature was unpleasantly low - and this is rather frequently found in LH long distance flights.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-08;BKK-FRA-BKK. LH 783 18 Dec BKK-FRA. LH 772 2 Jan FRA-BKK. Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. The food is similar to others in the same category. You can even order cocktails on long haul flights and they even serve with a smile. My personal opinion is that elder stewardesses or stewards can give better service than younger ones. Seat is hard and small inflight entertainment is good with choices of quite contemporary film material. We wish there were more toilets.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-08;Very good and attentive service on 431 from ORD to FRA on January 3rd - even though it was economy class. The meal quality was bad completely tasteless chicken and the seats plus legroom too narrow too much of a sardine box feeling during a long distance flight.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-07;Dusseldorf-Kiev return. Depart Düsseldorf Jan 1 2014 LH 3004. Return Kiev Jan 5 2014 LH 3005. Both flights on time service on board and catering very good. No inflight entertainment.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-07;LH456 from FRA to LAX on Jan 2 2014 with a Boeing 747-8 aircraft seat 1K. Excellent service and excellent food in the First Class Terminal in Frankfurt and on the plane to LAX. Highly recommended! Everything was presented very well and the quality was perfect. I also like the Bose noise cancellation headphones that the seat is equipped with.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-07;LH 419 from IAD to FRA. The lounge in IAD is less than average for First Class. The first Class seats are good and LH provides a heavy mattress and bedding to sleep. However LH has a policy of keeping the cabin at 23 deg C which is just too warm to sleep with all the heavy blankets I wish they would cool their cabin to a normal temp. The food was ok but certainly not great. The service from the flight staff was excellent. Finding my connection in Frankfurt was quite difficult and took quite a while to find the first class lounge.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-07;Lufthansa continues to have fantastic economy service. The air hostesses tend to be older than other airlines but their experience shows in the brilliant service given. The attendants are helpful and they also have free coffee/tea etc in their Munich airport area which is a big bonus. Additionally the beer on board is better than other airlines Warsteiner. The food is similar to others in the same category - the only complaint is the number of films available. Perhaps there are 50 different films but compared to Etihad or others this falls a bit short by today's standards. I was on a new Boeing 747-8 which is rare as I almost always fly Airbus routes which may have made my trip more enjoyable.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-07;Dusseldorf-Kiev return. Depart Düsseldorf Jan 1 2014 LH 3004. Return Kiev Jan 5 2014 LH 3005. Both flights on time service on board and catering very good. No inflight entertainment.;POSITIVE
lufthansa;2014-01-06;FRA-DXB return flight. Very good service on the way out. Good flight nice crew very uneventful. On the way back almost as good. The 747 landed in heavy clouds and didn't feel a thing. Entertainment is ok but not at the level of say Air Canada. On the way back I asked for lactose-free meal and got one that was pretty good. A great airline and a great experience.;POSITIVE
