qatar-airways;2018-09-06;" |  I flew from Tokyo to Casablanca via Doha and back during June and August this year. I was very impressed by the on board facilities overall. My special request for the food was approved and it was good. The flight attendants were fairly attentive and the arrival was on time almost all times. The problem was off-air when they changed the schedule 4 days before the travel, because they cancelled one flight from Casablanca to Doha in the afternoon. I had to stay in airport in Casablanca for 10 hours and no  courtesies were offered for the trouble although I am a privilege club member. Overall, a great experience onboard and terrible experience off-board.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-06;" |  Denpasar to Doha. Offered an upgrade to Business class, but mentioned in the fine print that this is not luggage allowance and comfort equal to a business class ticket. Bieten ein Update auf Business clas an leider wird im Kleingedruckten erwähnt dass nur der Sitz nicht aber Gepäck und Confort gleich einen Business class Ticket entspricht.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-05;" |  Sydney to Cardiff via Doha. Speedy boarding, left on time, food good, entertainment easy to use and extensive, seat bit more comfortable than usual economy seats. I particularly want to mention the air steward who was just fantastic. So courteous and helpful, he gave exceptional service. Got an upgrade from Doha to Cardiff. Thank you Qatar!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-03;" |  Doha to Muscat return. I would like to express my the best travel experience which I had two days before.  Wonderful experience. The flight quite amazing, Seat space and all experience are amazing. Thanks, Qatar Airways for providing the best travel experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-03;" | Flew Doha to Goa. Great airline, with a great service. Truly amazed by the attention to detail. Cabin crew members excellent as always, and inflight entertainment - Oryx One was good, but could have been better. Overall, a great experience. Looking forward to flying again with Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-02;" |  Milan to Cape Town via Doha. You have to be ""picky"" to fault anything on Qatar Airways : cabin crew is professional, attentive, they cannot do enough for you, food is good, aircraft are clean, everything seems to be working almost perfectly. Perhaps more free WI-FI on board would be a bonus.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-09-02;" |  Perth to Munich via Doha. The best flight I have ever flown. The flight from Doha to Perth (A380) was simply fabulous in many if not all ways. The flight was new, beautiful, with very comfy seats, lovely food and amazing entertainment system. The crew members were really caring passengers and professional. They were present throughout the flight. The best of the best!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-30;" | Flew Denpasar to Doha . So far my choice of airline still is with Qatar Airways even though on this route they have a little older airplanes. Excellent service onboard, good food and a splendid wine list. Friendly crew who really give superb service with a smile. Still annoyed about no free Wi-Fi when you pay for business class.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-29;" | Flew Mahé, Seychelles to Doha. As always Qatar Airways gives you a great travel experience. Clean new airplane and a very great crew. Selection of wine is splendid and food served when you like to eat gives you to time to work, have a nap or what watch a movie. Just a great experience. Only downside is that even in business class you have to pay extra for Wi-Fi.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-29; | As always a pleasure to fly Qatar Airways from Doha to Stockholm. Clean new planes and a great friendly crew. Service on top with good food and drinks. What you need after a few hours at the airport. Downside no free Wi-Fi not even in business class.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-29;" |  Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. Qatar Airways is by far the best business class product I have seen. It beats emirates and etihad hands down. The food is outstanding, cabin comfort is great,  and all food is on demand. The lounge though very crowded at times in morning serves much better food than emirates. Biggest down side compared to emirates is no chauffeur drive. The lounge they use in Atlanta is club atl which is ludicrous. It would be an insult to call it a lounge. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-26;" |  First class service on both legs of the journey. From Doha to London  I was fortunate to fly A350-1000. The Q-suite was amazing! The seat was comfortable to say the least, the blanket the best on any airline I’ve flowing and I’ve flown quite a few! Privacy could be obtained by closing the door, like the first class suite in Emirates first class. The service was excellent, with extremely attentive and courteous crew. Meal was good, with the option to dine at any time. Loved the entertainment on board- the selection is huge. Everything was slick and span! The coveted complimentary toiletry bag was a purple colour this time! All in all, a most wonderful flight! I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to the crew for a wonderful flight. Looking forward to the next one !";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-23;" |  I would like to say Thank you to Qatar Airways for taking care of me and hubby during long flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris return via Doha. It was a long journey but your staff took care of us very well. We do recommend others to please try Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways staff are really  good and take care of us. They all very well deserved for appreciation. Ground Crew also very good. My fragile stuff I checked in and never broken. The ground crew was full of confidence, that their crew take care the luggage very well and got security camera every where. Food was okay. Flight was clean. Entertainment was up to date, got all new movies, TV shows and nice motivational talks. Overall I'll give 9 mark out of 10. 1 mark I cut because of food. Need to improve a bit. Thankyou once again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-21;" |  Oslo to Melbourne via Doha. Excellent business class airline. I do a lot of business travel and have to say that some, like Qatar, are fantastic and others are not so good. The seat is big and comfortable. The service is attentive and strong. The meals were great as was the service concept - order what you want, when you want. Flights left on time, entertainment options were great - really only had positive feedback on all aspects. Had long sleeps on all flights. The business lounge in Doha airport is the best business lounge I've seen anywhere in the world, which is an added bonus. They are my airline of choice moving forward and have great reach into more minor cities in Europe than other carriers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-21;" |  Manila to Manchester via Doha. On the 17th  August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful. We landed in Doha, and we missed our 0155 am the QR27 flight to Manchester, they gave us another flight to catch at 0810 am with no fee at all and the expectations were the same as the previous flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-16;" |  Paris to Doha. We had a ONE WORLD logo aircraft equipped with the new QSUiTE, I had a technical problem with my seat once I put it the sleeping position it would not work again no matter what they tried it just lost all power, but other than that everything else with the flight was spotless. The IFE was superb especially in the movie selection, food was good and service was 5 star as always with Qatar Airways though the prices were very steep.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-13;" |  Perth to Warsaw via Doha. PER-DOH flight was not as review's suggested. Cabin crew, though nice, were running around like during a fire drill, giving a very bad impression. DOH-WAW flight on the other hand was much more pleasant than expected. Flight crew was absolutely fantastic and very helpful. Inflight entertainment was great and had plenty of moves to choose from however, not many new releases. All in all very, very good value for money!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-13;" |  Doha to Milan after a six hours layover at Doha Hamad Airport. I was a bit tired but not that bad, I was flying coach and I assigned myself a good window place, with just one other seat next to me as the layout was 2-4-2. I was wrong as I had under my feet the IFE box or something similar which made it so narrow. This should not be in any type of seat, but it was ok I found my space in a way to stretch my legs. My IFE was not working, just on arabic, which I don´t speak and I asked for someone to help me out from the staff but after two times being ignored, I gave up and decided to something else, also If watching a film would have been a good idea. The food was ok as well the cleanliness of the aircraft was good.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-13;" |  Bangkok to Doha. The flight was a really early one, boarding starting at 4.30am in the morning so passengers was really tired. As usual every aircraft from Qatar airways is perfectly clean and you now that you can expect a perfect ambiance, even in coach. I slept half of the flight and the attends actually offered me breakfast but they removed it as I slept on it, really polite.  The whole flight was really good as usual. Love Qatar Airways product.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-10;" |  Melbourne to Madrid via Doha. Between Melbourne and Doha I had an unfortunate accident spilling hot coffee on my lap. I was not hurt in any way but the cabin staff were kind and attentive, even checking up on me several times and offering remedies and suggestions! I would especially like to mention Erika and Zico who did everything to make me feel comfortable. I have travelled this route several times and have always had excellent service.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-08;" |  Travelling from Jakarta to Paris via Doha, but in this case the Flight from Jakarta to Doha using a relatively new Boeing 787. This is my first flight with 787, cabin has fancy lighting spacious cabin luggage. The only problem is the touchscreen on the inflight that cannot navigate properly. I brought my own headset i can barely decrease volume so it is so loud by default. Let alone browsing movies. Everything else was fine, Food was fine, crew were helpful with the bags.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-06;" |  Bombay to Dallas via Doha. I traveled with Qatar many times and have no complaints about the flight and inflight service. I traveled last on 31st July and seriously those people at Mumbai check in counters were very impolite and were kind of rude with me and wife. At one point they asked me to reduce my carry on bags from 2 to 1 irrespective of it meeting the weight criteria when I asked why they replied you will be questioned in Doha that why are you carrying 2 carry-ons? Check-in counters are the first customer facing point, don't ruin that part. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-08-02;" |  Melbourne to Rome via Doha. I would like to praise the excellent customer service I received from an agent at the desk at Melbourne Airport. He went out of his way to assist me and after a long stressful day, and  his professionalism courtesy and passion for his position was reflected in his treatment of me.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-31;" |  Ankara to Melbourne via Doha. I booked Melbourne to Ankara via Doha in July 18, but the flight was cancelled due to engineering fault. Reticketed next day for tight connections flights via Singapore. I had booked a premium lounge pass for Doha and as I was unable to use the pass with cancellation and rerouting I tried and was denied entry by lounge staff on my inbound flight. I was told to pay for admission and to put in a request for refund online for unused pass. My request for refund for the unused lounge pass was denied and I was offered a restricted voucher instead.  This is a pity as for the most part their flight staff is above average";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-31;" |  Singapore to Paris via Doha. Our was scheduled to depart at 21.20, however the flight was delayed, meaning we missed our connection flight in Doha to Paris. We did not receive any communication about this before arriving at the airport in Singapore.  The lady at the counter in Singapore kindly transferred us to the earliest flight departing from Doha, with scheduled departure at 7.35. We were told, once arrived in Doha, that the customer service will take care of us upon landing, granting us lounge access and compensation which did not happen.  Nobody was there at the arrival. We talked to a chain of people and found our self begging for information. At the service desk, we were given a voucher to be used for dinner and breakfast. The value was 65 QAR, we bought a pastry, an orange juice and a coffee. No place to sleep or freshen up was given. The inflight experience was okay. There was a good amount of entertainment choice. Food tasted and I personally did not like food being served almost halfway through the flight but that's just a personal preference.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-26; |  Nagpur to Atlanta via Doha. This is much better than other airlines internationally. The staff is very helpful and polite. I feel very safe when traveling in Qatar airways. All the non-vegetarian meals which are served are halal and taste good. The seats are comfortable and that’s what we need when we travel long distances.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-24;" |  Bucharest to Denpasar via Doha. Very good! We changed 2 flights, very good staff and great food and better services than others. The menu is balanced. Very clean toilets and cabin.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-21;" |  Vienna to Bangkok via Doha. I had great expectations from their service and quality of product they would offer. And in the overall situation they did a good job, but there were some little details which were not acceptable. Vienna Check in I was served by staff that did not care about me and she was doing the procedures during my check-in while talking with her colleagues next to her. I asked if she was aware that I had a short time in Doha, and after the second time she put me on the backpack the ""fast track"" stripe.  I was flying their new Boeing 787, which is really an incredible product, everything is new and really clean. I was really impressed from the seats, they were really comfortable, and I had plenty of legroom. The service of the first breakfast was excellent, they provided everything quickly and good, but the in flight snack was kinda strange, I asked what were the options, and it was a meat, chicken curry or vegetable sandwich. I wanted to try the second one, but I asked which kind of vegetables were inside, and the answer was to try it and you will discover it. I enjoyed the ife product on board a lot, with the personalized remote control in each seat. Also the toilet, had a nice touch such as the hand lotion and the parfume, like 15 years ago or in some business class products, it was a kind of old school touch that I liked a lot!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-21;" |  Boston to Trivandrum via Doha. The service at the airport and the ground crew and all were excellent. However the flight attendant we got was horrible, she didn’t really do anything we expect from the airline. Food was poorly given, our daughter didn’t get a toy usually given in the beginning.While this one was useless, I was able to get the attention of another attendant who was really nice and helpful. And on our flight back the service was amazing. Hopefully next time we will get better service both ways";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-18;" | Doha to Milan. A red eye flight fully booked , the aircraft was a bit old with the Qatar Airways old configuration in Business Class but the service was still superb they offered a light dinner and full breakfast, I enjoyed the dinner but skipped the breakfast, too many calories, though the same problem is faced on all Qatar Airways flights, movies are always up to date but TV shows are old . This is the high season for Qatar Airways and their tickets are on the pricey side. As an older aircraft there was no WiFi offered.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-15;" |  When I made the online booking the flight was pretty empty so I booked a window and aisle seat for my partner and, with an empty seat in the middle. When We checked in at BKK, we were told that they had put someone in the middle seat. I asked why, was the flight full? They said it wasn’t full but we’re filling the cabin for ‘safety reasons’. We asked if there was anywhere else on the plane where we could have an empty seat between us. They said no. When we got on the plane it was less than half full and there were empty rows everywhere! So why did we have to go through that at checkin. The flight was delayed for 2 hours for a technical reason. I found the food inedible. Lots of completion so won’t fly them again.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-14;" | Was looking forward to the privacy and comfort of my flight from Bangkok to Doha on the A380. But what a disappointment upon checking in at BKK airport. Qatar has three flights to Doha in the evening. One flight was cancelled, one delayed by 3 hours and my flight downsized from A380 to 777. Needless to say that my pre-booked seat was gone and I had to endure with a leftover seat for the next 7 hours. Flight was 100% full due to the other cancelled flight. 777 not nearly as comfortable as the A380 in terms of space, comfort, noise and dryness of the air. Service was average and rushed. Lounge at Doha airport very crowded as always during peak hours. I left after a while because lines even for the toilets were building up. They should really consider getting another lounge. Flight from Doha to Helsinki was much better on the smaller and reasonably comfortable B788. Overall, one flight below average, and the other good.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-14;" |  Munich to Tokyo via Doha. This is the first time I write a review on an airline, but I have to. I have been flying a fair bit over the years and I haven't had a service like that before. Qatar Airways staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are helpful with the food, explaining well what they have on offer. They are happy to prepare you a drink that cannot just be poured out of a bottle, like my gin and tonic yesterday.  They keep coming with water and juice throughout the flight every 30 minutes or so. I have never seen this on a long flight before. They are still friendly and heap it up for you.  Even more surprising is the state of the toilets. I'd almost feel sorry for the crew if I hadn't paid a fair amount of money for my flight. They are still clean one or two hours before landing. Thank you for this great experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-12;" |  I flown Qatar Airways from Kuwait To Munich Via Doha’s incredible Hamad International Airport / the 1 hour flight from Kuwait To Doha was operated on the Refurbished B777-200LR. I was sitting back in the 3-4-3 Economy, it was comfortable. The onboard Service was excellent, Crew were very friendly, it was a smooth flight. Then had a 2 hour layover in my favorite airport Hamad International, then boarded my flight to Munich on the A350-900. When I boarded the A350 I was amazed how spacious it was, both the 777 & A350 were Comfortable, but the A350 was more comfortable. The new Oryx Inflight entertainment is amazing and is very easy to use, Cabin Crew were very friendly on the second flight too, meal was excellent, there were 2 meals served on this 5 hour 40 minutes flight - first meal was a snack sandwich which tasted good, second meal was a main course breakfast, was delicious! They Were offering juices and water every 30 minutes with a nice smile, I’d like to Thank them! The seat legroom was generous, Amenity Kit was handed during boarding in Economy Class. Beautiful Mood Lightning System. I used to fly Emirates, but Emirates no more. Qatar Airways was much better.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-10;" |  Melbourne to Doha. The A380 seats are awful and small (31-32 ins seat pitch), I am a small person and could not even reach for my bag that was located under the seat. The service was poor, I had hardly any water offered on 15-hour flight. I found the vegetarian food disgusting, I actually returned it. The films selection is fairly good but te screen doesn't totally switches off so you end up with bright light in your face. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-09;" |  Doha to Amsterdam. Check in was efficient, nothing special. Staff on board were friendly and helpful couldn't ask for more, however the seat was very hard and uncomfortable. I was in the middle of a 3 seat combination, my husband on one side and a larger (wide) man on the other who decided that sitting for the whole flight with his legs wide open and his body taking a 1/3 of my seat made the flight very awkward. This is too close for comfort. When the food was served it was hard to make out what the food was - there was a croissant with one of meals, it was so shriveled up. Scrambled eggs with some dreadful sauce on it, other food offerings I found to be poor. My husband is 6'3"" so when fellow passenger in front reclined his seat the space became impossible.  Just improve on the quality of the food and give us a bit more space, it would make a world of difference.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-03; |  Philadelphia to Doha via Jakarta. First time flying overseas and I loved my flight with Qatar Airways. Professional and courteous staff for 12-13 hour and 8-9 hour connecting flight. Should I make it overseas again I’ll fly Qatar! ;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-07-02;" |  Brisbane to Moscow via Adelaide / Doha, and Qatar Airways is definitely one of the best airlines around. Its lounges are simply the best (especially with Krug Champagne) and the product is great for all classes. Ground staff is not often on par with flight attendants but I understand the standards are different. My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic. A321 flight with 100% occupancy are a little bit cramped, but for me Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines in the world, on par with Singapore Airlines";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-28; |  Travelled in Qatar First class (Doha to Perth). I am a gold member in Emirates but has decided to change carrier and tried Qatar Airways. I was not disappointed. In flight service in first is excellent. Crew were extremely friendly and clearly wanted to give a five star experience to their customers. Doha first class lounge is the best I have been. No doubt they have won a lot of awards. You need to travel with them to appreciate their superb service. A380 first class lacks as much privacy as in emirates but the seat and service makes up for all that. There are only 8 seats and crew give total attention and makes the journey one of the most memorable.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-25;" | Adelaide to Doha. The seats are not designed for tall people. Standing at 196cm (6’5) I couldn’t lay down straight in the bed. And with your legs enclosed in the bed position, bending them a little was nearly impossible and extremely uncomfortable. I flew Qatar long haul 16 months prior in economy and for me seat wise Economy (exit row seat) is better for someone of my height. But besides the seat Qatar Airways once again showed why they’re one of the best airlines in the world!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-24;" |  Tokyo to Athens via Doha. The staff, the food, the free hygiene pack and the entertainment is excellent. I love everything about this airline and will definitely fly with them again. Great job Qatar Airways till next time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-23;" | Zurich to Clark via Doha. It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check. Unfortunately my checked in luggage did not make the transfers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-23;" |  Perth to Paris via Doha. Absolutely amazing flights, both legs of the Perth to Paris trip were excellent. We were traveling with two kids and an infant, the cabin crew could not do enough for us. The seats were very comfortable and the food was amazing. Now, the most amazing part has been the in between service, a lady from the Australian office has been amazing with helping us plan the return leg. I have not had true hospitality like this aboard any other airline. Thoroughly impressed and cannot wait to fly again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-23;" |  We have never experienced such amazing service on any airline. The cabin service is outstanding - friendly and supremely efficient but never intrusive. Wonderful food beautifully served and every kind of drink you can think of! The airport in Doha is like a five-star hotel and the assisted passenger service puts Heathrow and Edinburgh to shame. We had a transfer time of just over an hour between our flights and our suitcases were waiting at the carousel when we arrived. A great improvement on last year's experience from Heathrow to Edinburgh when we had four hours between flights and British Airways only managed to deliver one of our suitcases 36 hours later! The Boeing 787 is a great aircraft but we preferred the cabin layout of the Boeing 777. We will definitely choose Qatar over any other airline in future. My husband needs a wheelchair so travel can be a bit stressful but I can honestly say, this was the best flight we have ever experienced and we have been flying between South Africa and the UK for 50 years!! Thank you!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-23;" |  Melbourne to Madrid via Doha. First time on Qatar Airways and they were good. I usually fly Singapore Airlines but my travel partner was a One World flyer so we tried Qatar. Seating on the A380 is very comfy with loads of legroom and what felt like a slightly wider seat than on Singapore Airlines. Crew were lovely on both flights though bar/food service was a bit slow and we had quite a wait. No drinks cart to start with like Singapore Airlines and the food wasn't all that wonderful but compensated for by the spaciousness and the crew themselves. IFE was good though movie list not as extensive as I expected. Crew from DOH to MAD were particularly friendly, professional and they made the flight a real pleasure.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-06-23;" |  Qatar Airways are a fantastic airline, but the Boeing 787 is awful and I would avoid this aircraft. The seats are very narrow with a 3-3-3 configuration and being in a centre seat it was a very tight squeeze for 5.5hrs (I'm not overly large, 175cm, 78kg). On sitting down it felt as if the seat had no padding and was extremly hard. The crew were lovely, the food was OK and we certainly didn't feel tired on arrival due to the 787 but what a squeeze. Such a small, hard seat- fortunately we had amazing flights on their A380 to/from Australia to compensate.";NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2018-06-14;" |  Kuwait to Cape Town via Doha. I am stuck in an airport lounge in Nairobi. A seemingly routine flight from Kuwait to Cape Town has turned into this three day fiasco. On 8th June I booked in as per normal at Kuwait Int Airport. Proceeded to the departure gates and waited to board the plane. The flight at first was delayed, no announcement or information was given. Only when fellow travelers started to get annoyed about the situation did Qatar staff try to explain.  We were to sit and wait, .no explanation. After 2 hours of waiting we were told there are technical issues with the plane. Again told to just wait. Another hour passed and we were told to go the transfer desk, massive confusion at the transfer desk as the staff did not know what was going on. Again we were told to wait, then two options, we wait till they fix the aircraft or take the next flight the next morning. I was then booked on a flight to Nairobi and was told all has been taken care of and that I will be connected with the next flight from Nairobi to Cape Town. Only to arrive in Nairobi and nothing of such was done. The crew in Kuwait did not issue the ticket correctly which led to the crew in Nairobi not being able to issue me with the connecting ticket, making me miss the last flight out to Cape Town. Then I was told failing that they can put me on a flight from Nairobi to JNB and then to CPT. That was 4 hours ago, no one informs or keep one updated. Turns out I won't be on the flight to JNB. I will be booked into a hotel and put on the first flight out in the morning? I am disappointed with this airline. There was no attempt to rectify, or defuse the situation...

First impression, chaos. There were plenty of staff greeting passengers and getting each customer to an agent, turning chaos into order. The agent  made eye contact and focused on getting me on my way.  Their lounge is shared with several carriers. Food included vegetarian options was not bad. The seating is just okay. The flight was delayed due to the aircraft arriving later. Announcements were audible and clear in the gate area. Boarding was special. US ICE agents lined the jetway asking questions and making us feel really special.  A flight attendant at the door showed me to my seat and offered a pre-departure drink. Crew appearance was sharp and professional. Sincere smiles lead me to believe they enjoy their jobs. Qatar offers dinning on demand in business class. I choose to eat right after departure to sleep on this 14 hour flight. My meal was special order vegetarian and was fresh and good, not great. I enjoyed a Grand Cru Pauillac. The Flight Attendant offered turn down service and he draped my seat with light bedding. In flat sleeping position the seat is wide and has generous width including space for my feet. I was able to sleep 9 hours in peace with the suite door closed. The space inside my suite was more than ample. Easy storage of all personal items. The IFE Screen is large and HD noise cancelling head phones are provided. I didn't find the selection up to the tech, but you can upload files to play using USB or near field connections. Service was friendly and prompt throughout the flight. The Flight Attendants could not have been better. Hamed Airport Doha is a very modern facility and the lounge and transit experience was easy and comfortable.";POSITIVE

Check in was smooth, unfortunately Qatar Airways use Turkish Airlines Business Class lounge at Dulles which is very small and crowded, I could not sit in it. I had an aisle seat on this flight which was not as nice as the window seats on my outbound flight, Qsuites are the most comfortable seats in business class I have ever used and Qatar Airways have the best service I have experienced. Food was alright, not as good as the catering service out of Doha. WIFI worked on part of the flight but not all, it was just good enough to use WhatsApp. The IFE on QSuites is better than the one offered on the A350 and much more user friendly arrival in Doha was on time.";POSITIVE

We missed the first day of our honeymoon and instead spent the night at a hotel in Qatar which took them over 2 hours to get us to.  On the return flight, we spent 45 minutes checking in and buying an upgrade. They made us reshuffle around clothes because one bag was slightly overweight.";NEGATIVE

A family crisis in the UK meant that I had to make a very short notice booking, and it was purely availability that resulted in using this airline. I was extremely impressed by all aspects of the experience. The staff were attentive, competent and very pleasant to engage with - absolutely wonderful. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was way above my expectations. The extremely long flight between Auckland and Doha was as comfortable as it could have been. Qatar Airways would certainly be my airline of choice in future. The return journey with Singapore Airlines (again booked at short notice and with very limited seat availability) was sadly well below the standards set during my outward trip.";POSITIVE

I headed to lounge which was really nice and peaceful and had a good brunch before the flight. Boarding which was fast and the amazing Qsuite 3K which was really good - a nice seat, amazing tv, brilliant and innovative. A welcome drink was given but the last drink, before take off staff came and asked for my dinner, she said in 15 mins we serve you since you ordered online. The cabin crew takes 1 hr 15 mins to make my table afterwords, they serve  chickpeas that were cold - I told them I do not need dinner and remove the table cloth. On arriving a lady who is in charge comes to say sorry we could not serve you food, I hope you had a wonderful flight.";NEGATIVE

I had to make my own bed which is a task because the linen has to be fitted, needless to say I failed (despite crew watching, no offer to help was made). I contacted the airline and they dismissed everything I had to say.";NEGATIVE

With that out of the way, it was my first time using the new Qsuite and the product is unmatchable - they could have given some more leg room but this takes nothing away total privacy. Very wide seat small storage space I with they made storage for shoes, the food was of good quality and I had a good sleep. Cabin staff super friendly, IFE was up to date and arrival was on time.

The aircraft were one of the newest from Airbus and Boeing. i really loved the interior design with the color of burgundy in accentuating the luxurious feel of the aircraft. The flight attendants were all very friendly and courteous with a genuine smile. The food was delicious with 3 choices of main course. The inflight entertainment system was also great. I have flown so many times before with different airlines and I have to say that this is the best airlines i have ever flown with. Having said that, it is not perfect. there are rooms for improvement in my opinion. the toilet could be cleaned more often, the content of the inflight entertainment system could be added more and be more consistent in all route (some route/aircraft type has better and more responsive screen than others), and i do hope some time in the future the fare could be cheaper because they are in the upper range of price.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-22;" |  We were not given directions while waiting and boarding at Melbourne Airport. No signs to indicate where each of the allocated zones 1-4 are located. Zone signposting was available at Doha check-in however so that was much better. Hand-wash in toilet is very harsh on the hands and mine felt like sandpaper at the end of the trip. Signs on the video screen say keep yourself moisturized, but there was no moisturizer in the toilets to use. No water was handed out early in the trip and I saw no water handed out at night. No smile from staff when boarding and most staff I saw did not seem very happy or friendly., some were okay. When we arrived in Doha, they announced that Ramadan had just started so drinking and eating in public are prohibited, then gave another message that Ramadan started the next day. I asked the staff if eating an. drinking in the airport during Ramadan is prohibited, but they said we can eat and drink day time during Ramadan. The food was okay  but not great. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-19;" |  London to Doha. Overall the experience is great and their flight attendants are really nice although their WIFI service is slower than dial-up connection. However, if you expect to select a seat when booking your ticket with them and actually flying on that seat, forget it. They push you back on the cabin for whatever excuse. Why allow you to select a seat when booking the flight if you will never honour it at check-in? I fly with them to Doha for work every other month but I guess this May 2018 will be the last. Great aircraft and facilities and very good crew but atrocious check-in personnel at LHR (polite but useless) and the worst customer service team I have ever experienced. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-18;" | I flew on upgraded business class on Qatar Airways from Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha (return). What a treat!! The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-16;" |  Denpasar to Paris via Doha. Overall a very good experience. First flight from Bali to Doha on the 777 was with their old business class offering. Seats are big and comfortable, however are angled flat beds and not completely flat. Travelling with my partner and a toddler the seat was wide enough for my son to sleep beside me which was a huge bonus. Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from. Once again the staff were some of the best I have experienced in the sky and nothing was too much trouble for them. Overall Qatar offer probably the best business product I have flown and would not hesitate to book them again. The others have some catching up to do.";POSITIVE

Adelaide to Doha on A350, comfortable and spacious seats, good entertainment system and fantastic crew. Also pre selected vegetarian meals which were very acceptable. Crew on this flight were attentive, smiling and courteous all the way. Doha to Manchester on Boeing 787 was cramped, uncomfortable with terrible entertainment system and miserable crew. On boarding this flight the crew were directing passengers down the wrong aisles causing frustration and back ups. During the flight they appeared tired and uninterested with little customer interaction. Probably one of the worst flights I've had with this usually excellent airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-14;" |  The departure from Kuwait was delayed by 1 hour. Crew apologized for the delay but this reduced my time in exploring Al-Mourjan lounge in Doha. From Doha to Singapore neither the map or onboard camera were working on the A350. Crew on both sectors were fabulous, however, IFE and seat comfort (1x2x1 layout) is a joke. Wi-Fi was unavailable for my flight to Singapore. On the way back to Kuwait my seat IFE was malfunctioning so they changed my prefer preassigned seat to another seat, thus causing me inconvenience. Food and service was fabulous but I would not fly Qatar Airways again.";NEGATIVE

At my assigned seat, ground staff came into the flight to ask me for my luggage tags and went out for a few minutes before returning back to the flight to tell me ok luggage is in. Before boarding my flight from Doha to Singapore, I asked if my luggage is on the flight but the person on the counter scolded me for holding on to my husband’s flight ticket saying that he should hold it himself cause I might lose it.  On the flight, I saw that my chicken dish had some aluminium foil still on it. They staff said sorry and said they would write report and gave me fruits. Entertainment system had to be rebooted during the flight lasting over ten minutes.";NEGATIVE

The service from the cabin staff was very good. We had a passenger sat next to us that was constantly clearing his throat and spitting into a bag from Heathrow to Doha. Unfortunately the cabin staff were unable to dissuade this awful habit. On the leg from Doha to Ho Chi Minh the seats were worse - again the staff were exceptional. The meals on both legs of the journey were catered for a certain pallet type which is expected but not helpful. Overall I would hold the aircraft staff at the top of airlines flown with but the seating and food could be so much better.";NEGATIVE

The food was really spicy and full of ingredients so I did not touch it too much. The cabin crew was really patient, polite, and they were really helpful in curating the details, from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight, I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore, but she gave the chance to have one from Business class, which I was just in love because of the Brics design. She was so polite, and talented and she was just four months with Qatar Airways, she really made my flight and all my 24h journey. I´m pretty sure she will make a good job and these are the way to create proud and loyal customers.";POSITIVE

I was flying coach, so was not expecting to have a first class experience, but neither in economy I would never offer a check in where the agent talks in the meanwhile that she has my baggage and my passport with her colleague about her personal staff. She was rude . Luckily the cabin crew were better and more helpful, but not outstanding, they did not know what was inside the snack they were offering. The cleanliness, space from the aircraft were really good and I loved the flight as well the IFE. If you are flying the Boeing 787 don´t sit too much in the back otherwise you will see more the wing than the sky.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-06;" |  Edinburgh to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent service, which I have now come to expect from Qatar. They outshine in almost every aspect. One gripe however, is the check in at Edinburgh, which may be managed by One World. This was seriously bad. It took 30 minutes to check in, with 2 passengers in front of me. The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation. We were then informed that there was no Fast Track (FT) for security clearance, but when we pointed out to the gate keeper that we were members of OneWorld, they allowed us to proceed through FT. Not sure why Qatar is not listed as a user of FT for its Business Class travellers. Onboard service was impeccable, with professional, efficient and pleasant staff, which is truly noteworthy. Wifi connectivity did not appear to work on the several times I attempted to use it.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-06;" |  Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha. Impressive service from beginning to end. The new lounge at BKK is a huge improvement on the previously shared lounge with THAI. Every encounter with Qatar staff was professional and based on the highest level of training. The business class lounge at Doha is now busier than when it first opened, as a result of which there is always a queue for a shower, but thankfully, it only takes about 15-20 minutes to wait until one is freed up.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-05-05; | Flew Qatar Airways from Colombo to Amsterdam via Doha. Check-in took ages even at the online bad drop counter. What's the purpose of this whole exercise of online checking if it does not minimize the fuss at the airport. Onboard did not see many smiles on the crew faces.

Will definitely use Qatar again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-04-18;" |  Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha. An evening service using Boeing 777 on first leg and Boeing 787 from Doha. Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha. I would seek them out actively in preference to the other middle eastern airlines, and that is really saying something.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-04-18;" |  Birmingham to Manila via Doha. Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn’t sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn’t too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good! Overall an outstanding flight and very good value for money. Being able to collect BA points and avios was an added bonus.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-04-14;" |  Johannesburg to Edinburgh via Doha. Qatar Airways provides a decent service with their flights, but other areas are lacking. You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude. This was ridiculous. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2018-04-14;" |  My wife and I had booked a return trip Adelaide to Frankfurt via Doha over Easter. A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha. This was well worth it, we ate well, our Romanian our flight attendant was excellent and attended to our every need and I managed to sleep about 9 hours. The next leg, Doha to Frankfurt was only 6 hours and it passed uneventfully but in Economy Class. Our return flight, about 12 days later from Frankfurt to Doha passed quickly as well. On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard. Boeing 777 middle row of 4 seats is very squeezy by comparison to the A350 and there is little space for 8 legs and feet. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient.";POSITIVE

Onboard service is fantastic, flight attendants are the best in the business, hard-working and hospitable in every way. The food is good. The seats on the A350 are nice, the B777 less so. The IFE on the A350 is great and easy to use. The B777 less so. At JFK, we were delayed leaving. The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha. Next morning the immigration was woefully understaffed. It took 1 hour to clear immigration because there were a couple of disinterested workers and hundreds of passengers needing to get through. Security screening can be hit and miss. Things allowed through some times, next time they are taken. ";POSITIVE

Service on board fine, food is deteriorating (small portions, oily, no meat options), but FAs and drink offers almost make up for it. Qatar as a country suffers tremendously from the Arab ban/embargo put on them from their neighbours causing increased food prices and for QR it implies huge deroutings on most African and S-American destinations (add up to 3 hours per leg!). FAs are the best in the air, always focused, energetic, proactive, attentive, and committed, and hardworking. Rarely – if ever? Have I seen better FAs. Personalised service for everybody onboard the business class cabin. They still do charity collections onboard – to my view a violation of passengers. IFE very good.

qatar-airways;2018-03-30;" |  Booked a 15 day day food tour of India, starting from New Delhi and ending up at Goa, Qatar Airways offered the best route. Manchester to Doha was on the B787-8, cabin crew were pleasant in particular the head purser who was apologetic and showed empathy as they did not have my food choice by the time she reached me. The passenger next but one to me, was argumentative as he did not get his food choice as well, she handled the situation extremely well. She explained to the passenger that number of food choice is governed by projected demand and supply. This happened to me again from Goa to Doha, again the cabin crew was apologetic and and showed empathy. From Doha to Manchester, luckily I was seated near the front and therefore had choice of food, and they provided numerous drinks run throughout the flight. I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food. I think Qatar Airways and also the other airlines need to have more food portions available as it must cost pennies to produce the meals during their flight.";POSITIVE

Everything starting from Ground Services at Ahmedabad Airport till Chicago was up to mark, and niche, they make you feel like king when you fly business with them. When I got down at Doha Airport as part of ny transit to Chicago, I was been welcomed with a broad and welcoming warm smile at Al Moujran Lounge which is for Business class. Has great showers and very helping and cooperative staff, they gave me Dental kit and reserved a shower for me, washroom are huge enough with all the amenities and privacy. They have various restraurants ranging from Made to order to Buffet with varieties of food and beverages, must try is their Arabic Platter with Hummus and Pita Bread and lentil soup. After a short break I boarded the aircraft, which had dedicated Business class priority boarding, which was very smooth. I was having 6A seat on this flight. Seat was very comfortable with great pitch and legroom, I almost had more than 4 windows at my disposal for a great view, they are having almost 26 inches of screen with touch and remote operated system. Seat can convert in to fully flat bed , it has massaging options and various positioning options. They provided me with Pyjamas. Both the things were of a good quality and very niche product indeed. They welcomed me with options of Sparkling water, wine or champagne. Along with hot and cold towel. Seat has power outlet to charge your gadgets or laptops , Qatar airways even provide customers with Laptop on demand if u want during your journey. I got one as I had to finish one presentation. Food can be made to order and you can choose your own time of having it.  They had varieties of beverages.  I had a good nights sleep with fully flat bed and ambient lighting. Had a great breakfast. Keep it up Qatar airways";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2018-03-26;" | Flew Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha. The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control. WiFi is for free up to 10MB (!) more can be purchased, however it is really slow and occasionally working.";POSITIVE

The seats are in a herringbone configuration of 1-2-1. They are very comfortable and can be converted to a full flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited in the bed position. But still, they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth. Passengers can select when, what and how many times they wish their meals to be served. It is a nice thing, but it means that people eat in different times, hence the flight attendants run up and down the cabin during the whole flight and smell of food is always present in the cabin. At the aft of the business cabin a full size bar can be found with canopies, fruit and a bartender who serves cocktails. It is simply amazing! The WiFi is free up to 10Mb, but it did not really work to me and the selection of movies could be wider.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2018-03-20;" |  Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha.  Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld  members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft.  My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic. I was unimpressed with Qatar Airways and next year when we visit Bhutan we will use a different OneWorld carrier.";NEGATIVE

Due to technical problems, my flight from Jakarta to Warsaw via Doha was delayed, so I was redirected to Brussels but Qatar Airways forgot to book me the further flight to Warsaw, which led to my 25 hours late arrival in Warsaw. My destination was Poznań, I had to change the ticket 3x and pay the extra costs. In Brussels, representatives of Qatar Airways told us that all costs associated with our travel will be compensated by Qatar Airways.

Qatar A380 business has to be my favorite aircraft, so quiet and comfortable. Boeing 787 to Copenhagen was full, I don’t like this cabin compared to that of both the 380 and 350 - I feel you are more ‘exposed’ even though it’s the same seat and the 787 is by far a noisier aircraft. One area where Qatar needs to improve is the food, it was abysmal on both sectors, the offering from Doha was disgusting. The crew were fine, but I find few crew engaging until the end of the flight where they ‘have’ to ask if your flight was enjoyable, it seems staged.";POSITIVE

QR905 delayed due to mechanical ex Melbourne, no info from QR, relied on Qantas lounger updates, probably a visit from uniformed QR staff to lounge would have been in order, finally boarded 3 hours late which meant missed connecting flight to LHR. QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average,  no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds. Flexible airfare so premium price paid. QR still far superior to majority of other airlines, just need to improve the ground staff support, will continue to fly with them.";POSITIVE

We only had one checked baggage and one carry on each, so below by one checked baggage. Because my CPAP bag was temporary on top of the Carry on they wanted me to pay extra. I explained that I can take my Medical bag off and an argument by the staff started. Eventually a Supervisor intervened and commonsense kicked in. The crew onboard were far from friendly except for the JNB to DOH that flight was as all flights should be, friendly and with good friendly service. Entertainment screen was only 8 inches away from my face. Most of the time my entertainment system didn't work by the Touch Screen or by the Hand Control. Main food meal was tasty and good but snack food tasted awful. Water was regularly offered throughout all flights. ";NEGATIVE

Plenty of drinks were offered, and when we asked for anything the crew went the extra mile to fulfil our wishes. One of our B773ER planes and the A330 still had the old Oryx One entertainment system with a low-resolution screen - the newer entertainment systems on the other planes were excellent! Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable, even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated, they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted check-in for Qatar Airways: they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram, as strictly as for any low-cost carrier. I can‘t imagine Qatar‘s own staff to be that stringent on weight limits.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-03-13;" | This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn’t complete torture. It’s up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I’d say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don’t have access to the regular business class lounge but  a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn’t matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it’s open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it’s economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I’ll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy.";POSITIVE

The seats feel cramped and narrow when compared to the A380 which is flown in the second leg. The entertainment system is difficult to navigate and the volume is particularly difficult to control. The seats are difficult to move from reclined back straight. 5/10 Service was ok but not at the top of the market when compared to Singapore, Cathay or even Qantas. I wished to change the food order for the children but the hostess made only a brief attempt to find alternative meals and then never came back to let me know definitively that no meals were available. 5/10 Food: Very average meals, serves are small and generally would advise steering clear of European style meals. Indian meals taste better. 5/10 Overall disappointing compared to competitors.";NEGATIVE

Copenhagen to Doha, the seat on the 787 is far superior to that of the old style seat on some 777. However the food was bad , the chicken was inedible and the crew were noisy in the galley. The lounge experience in Doha was again, exemplary. The staff are so friendly and the waiter service and a la carte menu impressive. Boarding for the BKK sector was a bit of a scrum, they could make the priority lane more prominent. It was literally a case of pushing through passengers trying to board. Doha-Bangkok sector and the crew couldn’t have been more different from their colleagues on the Copenhagen sector. For such an early morning departure they were friendly and had a genuine warmth. Food was much better, supper was delivered speedily after take off, and the pancakes for breakfast were delicious. The one thing that lets down QR on the old 777 are the seats, it was uncomfortable to sleep on, but I was so tired I managed a few hours. All in all though a much more positive experience than my previous flights with QR.";POSITIVE

After leaving a few comments regarding my outward flight from Melboure to Birmingham, Qatar contacted me for further details and ensured me my return trip would be different.

Cannot say enough about Qatar customer service and Cabin crew. A great airline who want to continually improve by listening to customers. I am not a serial moaner and travel frequently to the UK and back. Previously I have experienced poor service with Emirates and followed the complaints/comments procedure. Still waiting for a reply over 2 years ago, which shows clearly the difference between these two airlines. ";POSITIVE

FAs are excellent – world-class. Annoying announcements – many of them superfluous. They continue their charity propaganda for Educate a Child – that really puzzles me. How naïve are we passengers to blindly support financially some glossy outlayed institution without providing neutral facts? The 2nd flight left 02 a.m. and did hardly have any food for business class. No real hot dishes – no fish, no meat, only cold piece salmon was offered. They offered a beef filet which was only a spoon of rice with some shredded meat in a heavy brown sauce. No chilli, no fishsauce, no ginger, no icecream, no nothing. I was only saved by an alert FA who managed to secure me a reasonable meal of fish from economy class. Never experienced this before when travelling in business class. Seats in these A330 aircraft are lie flat but narrow that your feet are squeezed if stretching the legs out into a tiny hole under the seat in front. Paid by far too much for this ticket. However, luggage and lounge access functioned well.";POSITIVE

My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board). I accepted and for my troubles I was given an exit row on my first flight and an entire row to myself on the second. Qatar economy has nearly 2 extra inches on most other airlines and you can tell. As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you. Easily my new second favourite airline.";POSITIVE

While there is always a risk of delayed flights & connections in long haul flights, it is the way tough situations get handled that set an airline apart. Qatar Airways did an emergency landing in Moscow (a person onboard was sick) on my flight from Doha to Montreal. What ensued was a comedy of errors. They made people wait for 5 hours, did not have any game plan to provide accommodation when we got back to Doha (they took us back).

We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they don’t know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized it’s impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we don’t have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I don’t have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but don’t have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and don’t know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny.  Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me.

So at the end as the last people who were served we didn't had a choice of the food. The cabin crew were nice, polite and friendly. They tried their best even if the company didn't provide them enough of tools to make their work excelent. The last issue was getting back my bag. I was in shock when i get my suitcase damaged. I went and reported it right away, I got report and everything was alright. At Tegel Airport I was informed that i have to call company DOLFI that works with Qatar Airways to solve the issue. That's what i did and here i got another suprise! Lady on the phone told me that she can't help me i have to contact airline.  I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding.

The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world. I wouldn't go too far out of my way to avoid Qatar Airways, but they've been gliding on their grammatically painful world five star airline motto for far too long.";NEGATIVE

Doing the minimum,  serving a meal in a totally indifferent way, then disappearing behind a curtain not to be seen for the remainder of the flight. The bar counter at the back of the Business cabin was left depleted and dirty, not once in over 4 hours did the crew check on passengers and enquire about drinks. Only during the last hour or so did they reappear to offer, unenthusiastically, drinks or snacks. The food was good, but with a service expedited as quickly as possible (the cabin was full or almost). The wines have recently taken a  dive for the worse.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-02-16;" |  A most unpleasant check in experience at London Heathrow. Very bad attitude from their check-in staff, no welcome at all or reply to my greeting, I asked politely the baggage limit to be barked that it's 1 piece, and no reply when I politely stated that I was after the weight limit (I still don't know the weight limit, my baggage was 25kg so above that). The check-in girl sat staring at my passport for 4-5 minutes, then asked me if I had any other ID. Then with passport in hand she kept reaching for the phone and dialling numbers, without telling me what was going on. This was at 6am, she eventually got hold of her supervisor who came over and said the visa was fine. Any questions I asked where answered with ""Thats just the way it is"" again and again. Eventually they checked me in, but they were so rude, I don't understand why they were unpleasant. It was the strangest of experiences, in a bad way. In over 20 years of travelling this was the most unpleasant check-in experience I have had.";NEGATIVE

Crews were helpful and a staff from the Ft Lauderdale office provided me hotel accommodation in Doha for a layover due to the changes that they made on my flight schedule.

I would rate this airline highly. Keep up providing good service to customers!";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2018-01-27;" | Travelled 21 & 22 Jan 2018 with Qatar Airways from Ho Chi Minh via Doha to Entebbe and Kigali. Reliable airline, punctual flights, world class service, good drinks, poor food with no diversity, small portions, clean, newer aircrafts. Good lounge in Doha with slumber rooms. Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don’t they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been ½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP. Lousy and expensive WiFi offered on-board with lots of patronising registration and information requirements. Charity collection “Educate a Child” is widely announced, intrusive and useless: they still claim to help 58 million uneducated children as they also did 5 years ago. So obviously no progress, have the collections gone into the drain?";POSITIVE

When I returned to Berlin, I realized that my brand new Rimowa suitcase got badly damaged. I reported the damage and received a brand new one without questions asked 2 weeks later.

A little more expensive than other airlines in the region, but they fly point to point rather than hubs and transfers, which I prefer. Online services good as is their loyalty programme, although you need to progress to the next tier first before you get anything. Generous baggage and seating space on aircraft is good, although the aisle is narrow and passengers not looking where they are going can easily hit other seated passengers with their bags. Cabin crew are superb and helpful, and if you get them a box of chocolates for the journey they are genuinely pleasantly pleased. The food is normally good as is the choice of beverages on offer. The entertainment system has some good movies, but often has problems working properly. Customer services is absolutely awful, with many queries not answered or the staff point you to the webpage information where you said you didn't understand what was on the page.";POSITIVE

On previous flights, I had twice tried to sign on to Qatar's frequent flyer programme, but somehow this did not work out. I had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat, as I have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently. On the flight from Doha to Bangkok I was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong. I requested that I be allowed to change the seat, explaining that I might get problems, but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full. In Bangkok, I had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport.  I needed to leave Bangkok eight days earlier than booked. The ticket I had bought stated that I would be charged 173 Swiss francs for any change of reservation, but when I tried to make the change online, the cost was given as 355 Swiss francs. I called the Qatar office in Bangkok. They confirmed that this was a mistake, ""probably a software problem“, and then proceeded to charge me 202 Swiss francs. I was told that I was charged more because my change of reservation had to made manually. To me, this is not five star.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-01-15; |  Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. Qatar Airways are absolutely fabulous! I'm so glad that i discovered this airline. Noticeably better than other airlines i have flown with.  Booking process is the best it could be. Ground service is very efficient and courteous. Boeing 787 and A380 have comfortable seating (more so on the A380) and the onboard food i always enjoy. Crew are polite and friendly. I hope they remain in a price range that i can afford so that i can continue to fly this airline on my annual two holidays. ;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2018-01-15;" |  Melbourne to Geneva  via Doha and Marrakesh to Melbourne on return. Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud. I asked for a headset and got through 4 headsets, not one worked properly. One ear only would work on 3 pairs and with the other it was a robotic sound and I could not hear properly. I ended up using my own headphones but only half on my ears. My handset flashed the entire journey which was very offputting. They tried to re-set it 3 times, but it did not help. For one of the legs I was in an exit row and the handsets are next to your hip which meant I kept pressing the buttons without meaning to, interrupting my movie by randomly selecting a game for example. Food and drink I cannot fault - probably the best airline food I've had in economy. Cabin staff service: was much better than ground staff, very amicable and helpful.";NEGATIVE

The inbound plane arrived on time but we still left close to hour late. Crew was professional, friendly and proactive. Catering was poor with the exception of soup which was excellent. Food was not heated enough or did not appear fresh. The seat on this Boeing 777 has no privacy. Even with eye mask you can still detect seat mates IFE screen.  Pajamas and slippers were nice touch and good quality. Blanket and pillows high quality. Crew kept toilets clean throughout flight. Landed late and parked at remote stand. Transit security was easy at Doha. Lounge is beautiful but signage inside was poor. Odd that the main showers are located behind the dining area. Had to ask staff several times for location. Doha to CMB left on time. Regional business class seat on A320 was fine for five hours to Colombo. Again the crew was outstanding, very professional and friendly. Catering was much better out of Doha.";POSITIVE

QR in my opinion, was excellent, and deserve all the critical acclaims. 4 flights with them, crew and catering on all flights were wonderful. Very consistent good service, my Sapphire status with MH was recognised and acknowledged. Between HK to DOH route, an A350 was deployed, a new beautiful aircraft, very comfortable seat which turn into flat bed. Between DOH to Vienna they use B737, it was just equally as comfortable. Nothing was compromised at all. The transfer in Doha was very smooth and easy, I loved their beautiful and spacious lounge, truly a place to relax.

The ground handling service and baggage delivery at arrival in Houston is unacceptable, crew bags were delivered first followed by mostly economy class bags and then business class bags. I don't understand how difficult it is to take care of business class customers. Inflight product is great in the premium class.

Only downside was use of transfer bus from gate to aircraft instead of a bridge. Food quality and flight entertainment were excellent, as well as choice of beverages (soft drinks, and juices - not interested in alcoholic drinks as I do not consume them!). During the flight a problem arose with the passenger at the front fully reclining his seat. In spite of my polite requests not to fully recline, he became rude and we started arguing. Cabin staff intervened, first with no success, as the guy became abusive towards me and my wife. The head of cabin crew then intervened successfully. We started talking and explained to me airline procedures relating to this sort of situation. At some stage he held a briefing with cabin crew on all flight events and relevant procedures as well as closing the day. I submitted a written commendation regarding cabin crew professionalism on handling of this sort of situation. Really amicable - well done!";POSITIVE

We took off on time, the meal service options were roast chicken with potatoes or beef stew, I chose the chicken which wasn't the best. I tried to sleep but due to cramped legroom I couldn't, so I took a walk, I got back to my seat and started to watch the IFE, but it was small but had a lot of options. We landed at Hammad International airport 30 minutes late, had a 2 hour layover before boarding the Boeing 787-8 to Jakarta, again the legroom was cramped but this time the IFE had a USB charger, so I could charge my phone.

My partner who is very tall loved the extra leg room. I just loved being upstairs where it was a bit quieter and definitely helped me settle my nerves with flying. We were able to sleep and on the second half of our journey the staff were very accommodating. Thank you Qatar Airways, looking forward to flying home.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-12-18;" |  Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar’s service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don’t give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone. Qatar has become my airline of choice for international travel.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-12-18;" |  Manila to Doha. The best traveling experience I’ve ever had! Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew’s attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there’s less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period.";POSITIVE

I was told that I was not listed, despite having my ticket with seat numbers allocated. I had to repurchase my ticket. On my return home, I  contacted my travel agent and Qatar Airways.

The legroom was very cramped and it was hard for me to fall asleep, dinner service started with delicious Middle eastern fried rice and mango juice was my drink selection. The IFE was pretty slow but had lots of options. We had a rough landing at Doha, Hamad international airport and had a 2 hour layover before our flight to Paris. We boarded the A380 with even friendlier smiles, we took off on time and had a beautiful scenery view of Doha during take off. Breakfast service started and the options were ""French toast covered in vanilla sauce"" or Omelette, I chose the French toast option and it again was delicious, this time I had coke. I started to watch the IFE again, but this time it was faster and had better options. Soon snack service started and the options were Chicken or Vegetarian puffs, I chose the chicken options and it was delicious again, this time I chose the drink of orange juice.

The B777-300 is a real workhorse however in economy it feels a bit crowded, to be fair the flight was at capacity and having my first flight be on the A350 it was noticeable how much more crowded the 777 felt. The seat has plenty of legroom, the amenities, the food, the entertainment, and the service, are the best that I have experienced in economy on any airline.

qatar-airways;2017-12-12;" | I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you’re considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and I’ll fly with them as often as I can and you should to.";POSITIVE

As the airport staff ran out of taxi vouchers, we had to pay for our own taxi to the hotel and were promised to be payed back the next day. I was never informed by any Qatar staff about my new departure time. As the airplane was still broken the next day they had to rebook us on different flights. I had to spend 2,5 hours on the phone to a call centre agent in India who rebooked me on a different routing. At the airport I was not able to claim my taxi money back. After arriving with 20 hour delay in Munich I went to the Qatar Airways office to claim my taxi money back and was given a sheet of paper with an email address where I should write my claim to. I wrote my claim and never got an answer or any money back. After calling the Call centre again, I was told this time that the email address was wrong. So who knows if I will ever be reimbursed.

The outward journey to Perth was excellent - the seating is very comfortable (better on the A380 than the 777), food was great, and there's a good range of entertainment. Changing planes in Doha was easy although a small issue was that the business class lounge doesn't have enough showers to meet the demand, and we had to wait quite a long time. However, our return journey from Sydney on 19 November was a disaster. We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed. Around lunchtime, another passenger I spoke to advised me to check under manage booking on the website. when I did, to my surprise I found I had been booked on a flight via Beijing in less than an hour, and never told. By the time we got to check in, we'd missed that. There were no Qatar staff at the airport, but eventually we did get through to a call centre, and finally got rerouted on Qantas to London. Qatar has made no effort to contact us since - I'd hope they'd at least refund what we spent on phone calls. I understand technical problems can happen, but an airline needs some sort of contingency plan, and a global 24/7 airline really needs a 24/7 call centre.";NEGATIVE

Fortunately, the inflight service was really nice, the cabin crews were all really friendly. Also the food service was really nice.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-12-01;" |  London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat, service, lounge etc and would happily have given a 9/10 rating for this airline. However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers. After waiting in line for two hours I was allocated a hotel room and told that Qatar Airways would contact me by telephone with details of onward journey. Finally arrived at hotel at 2.15am. By 10am the following morning I had heard nothing and was due to check out of hotel by 11, together with other passengers who had heard nothing. Numerous calls to the number given for the airline were unanswered and I eventually decided to check my booking online and found that I had been re-booked on a Qantas flight leaving that afternoon. I made my own way to the airport and checked in with no problem but to date, now ten days later, I have had no communication from Qatar Airways. I appreciate that there can be technical difficulties but the total lack of customer service is not what one expects from an airline.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-28;" |  I flew from Doha to Guangzhou,  business class service has been downgraded comparing with last time I flew Qatar. The new sandwiches bar at Al Mourjan lounge is very good but the same moment they stopped the a la carte menu on the second floor restaurant, it is now a self service buffet, but previous restaurant was unique among all business class lounge.  Yes they offer a pre flight booking service, but this is not the book to cook service. Only selection is from the menu of the given flight. On my case, there was not any dinner served, only a sandwich selection, so I had sandwich on the lounge and then sandwich on the plane. Last time I flew a year ago, with the same flight, there was full dinner service. There were not pyjamas on my size and they gave me the biggest they had, a medium/large which I did not use. At least the personnel and the chief crew member were very good. Very efficient and provided very good service beyond expectations, so I have to congratulate them and the airline for their training.";POSITIVE

I have enjoyed flying economy with Qatar before but this was the next level,  Business class was superb in every way, very comfortable seat and settings with ample storage. The service was excellent with a great selection of food and drinks available both to the seat and at the onboard cocktail bar. Very much looking forward to our next trip with Qatar Airways!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-28;" |  Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers -  it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane. Onboard wifi is available too - 15 mins free or more at a cost if required. The entertainment on board was great and I didn't run out of things to watch or listen too.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-24; |  Doha to London. I have flown in Qatar business class cabin before but this is the first time I flew with the latest business class cabin in the Boeing 787. The seat is excellent with ample storage. I managed to take a nap in relatively 'short' long haul flight. The lighting and temperature were good enough to let me taking my nap. There were a lot of options for the IFE and the quality of screen was excellent. The food was also great as always. The service from the crews from the start of journey until the end of the trip was above average. I think they deserve to be the best airline.;POSITIVE

Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class. I am shocked at the inconsistency between its rules applied on check-in in Barcelona and Hong Kong outstations.";NEGATIVE

Flight departure from Singapore was delayed of 1 hour and soon as we landed in Doha, we were redirected to Prague and then from Prague to Barcelona, arriving with a 4 hour delay. My connection from Doha to Barcelona was rescheduled departing 1 hour 30 minutes earlier and nobody informed us.  My flight out of DOH was supposed to depart at 2.05am (we landed in DOH at 1am) so time to be short connected. We were not offered an upgrade, or use of the lounge to have a rest.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-20;" |  Atlanta to Chennai return via Doha. Baggage check-in process was simple and easy.  Meal preferences was good - I'm a vegetarian and on the onward journey forgot to specify the meal preference but the crew had enough inventory to meat the requirements. Every seat was provided with a small plastic pouch/packet/goodie bag that consisted of a eye mask, pair of sock, toothpaste+brush, hand cream. This was very useful and effective. Entertainment options were good and current.  Online check-in wasn't easy. towards the end of the process, there is an option to email the boarding pass but this never worked for me.  It would have been good, as part of the online check-in, if the users reminded to specify the meal preferences, etc. I forgot to specify the meal preferences but thankfully the crew had enough of what I wanted. Seats were the worst part - poor legroom.  ATL to DOH leg was the worst (and the longest leg of the trip), comfort wise, I would rate as the worst. Luckily on the return leg (DOH-ATL) next two seats to mine was empty, so was able to stretch and sleep well. DOH-MAA vv seating was little better, think its a older plane. newer planes have worst seats. Food was ok dinner and lunch but minimalistic. There was no alert or reminder of upcoming trip via email or text, etc. ";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-11-19;" |  We were flying from Paris to Doha in business class in the new Q-suite. You are immediately overwhelmed by the luxury this new suite has to offer. We fly as a couple and when we were seated they lowered the blind in between the two seats so you immediately felt that you had your own private compartment. We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane. The seats have many modification possibilities, even a real double bed feature. My wife fell in love with the blankets who were especially designed for this new q-suite, they feel so nice. The in-flight entertainment set provides a very big bright screen and the latest hollywood blockbusters available. The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most. It was no problem to switch the desert and main course since it looked more appetising to me. The food was really good. Even with ordering some snacks they explained everything what was on the menu and recommended the size of portions i ordered. It was really an amazing experience and we never thought we were kinda disappointed that the 6:30hr flight was over.";POSITIVE

Check in at BKK was quick and easy offered fast track immigration and lounge access with my FF status QR use the Thai Airways lounge in satellite E which was packed so I didn't stay long. Boarding from E1 was organised and very early completed 30 min before departure time I was a bit sceptical using the 777-300ER because of the 3-4-3 seating my previous QR 777 flight was only 25% full so comfortable but again this flight was only 50% capacity so had 3 seats to myself 12A. Aircraft was clean and tidy and departed before scheduled departure time. Once airborne a pretty decent breakfast served along with drinks and a hot sandwich 1hr 30 min out of DOH. This 7hr flight was great I managed to sleep 4 hrs. I only had 45min to transfer at DOH although it was plenty of time with the flight to LHR departing from the next gate. My first time on an A350 and what a nice aircraft, lucky enough another half empty aircraft in economy so once again I had an exit row to myself 30K. Departed on time and again food served within an hour of departure, the flight went quickly, great service, food was good for economy. The aircraft is great, very comfortable. Arrived on time with bags waiting once through immigration. the best 2 economy flights I have had for many years. Clean aircraft, great crew, good food and great value for this trip. Still my favourite long haul airline.";POSITIVE

IFE is very good. Main meal was good although the portions these days are extremely small. All drinks including water are served in small plastic cups. Plenty of drink runs were made throughout the flight. Only disappointment was the breakfast, some sort of snack wrap which was awful. Stockholm to Durban was delayed once we were all on board and ready to take-off. Not the airlines fault, there was a medical problem with one of the passengers so we parked and medics were called. It meant we missed our connection in Doha, As we came off the plane there was our name on a board, the ground crew had our new boarding passes and vouchers for a hotel, very officiant! Beautiful 5 star hotel (even for economy class passengers) far better than the one Emirates uses in Dubai. Very generous meal allowance of $180 per person, couldn't even spend it all. I have flown with all three Gulf airlines and have to say Qatar Airways is by a long mile the best. PS - $380 return Durban / Stockholm on a 24 hour special, unbelievable.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-18;" |  Delhi to London via Doha. The return flight from DEL to DOH was uneventful, mainly due to the fact I slept most of the way. With a 3.45 departure I could not believe ear plugs had been removed from the wash bag to be replaced by a lip balm. In DOH I was told that even with a First ticket you could not take a guest with you, even though he was on a business ticket. A380 back to LHR, the difference between Qatar’s business and first is the seat. The cabin was spacious and the seat did make a comfortable bed, but no pjamas offered and no mattress cover, only a meager thin blanket con this daytime flight. Food was the same as business , nothing special. Free wifi provided was very patchy. Took a trip to the bar to see it as had been told was worth a look, and it was but very busy, so retreated back to my seat. Crew on this flight were a delight, CSD was professional but friendly and the other crew were a joy! Much better standard than on the way out. Personally I don’t think first class is worth the price with Qatar difference with in business.";POSITIVE

Service: best customer service, personalized assistance. Seats configuration of economy class on Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner not the best but at least it’s not cramped like on big airlines of Europe or Asia. At the end of the day you get what you paid for, so if you want better food options, a seat like a sofa at your home or you need someone to put pillow under your head - choose business or first class accordingly. I’m 100% happy with what they offered and what I had because many similar airlines doesn’t have even half of what Qatar Airways has.";POSITIVE

The flight was good although food not especially from Doha to Amsterdam which was terrible (a smaller plane), then on the flight back to Australia on A380 the food was bad as well - the breakfast I chose was cream scrambled eggs - the first time food was cold so the air hostess brought another plate which was uncooked and not eaten, and coffee came out black and cold - orange juice warm and no ice.

The business class seat in the middle is very exposed on the 787, however the A350 was a much nicer cabin experience, even though the central overhead lockers are removed, the A350 seemed my more spacious and airy. Food was nothing exceptional, dine on demand is fine in business, however if your  to sleep and the passenger opposite decides at 2am to eat, you’ll be disturbed. The pyjamas were a lovely touch, but the rest of the bedding was really poor, think blankets and lumpy pillows. Service out of CPH was rushed and the crew seemed harangued, however on the MLE sector it was much improved,  the cabin was half full. I think Qatar crews lack the finesse and professionalism of Singapore Airlines, quite disappointed for my first time with QR.";POSITIVE

However on this flight to Paris - Bangkok - Doha and then Doha - Paris, I noticed a few things which should be improved. Check-in in Bangkok could be better and more classy. Business check-in was a bit too laid back. In Bangkok, Qatar uses Thai Airways Business lounge. It is a great lounge but some privileges are not accessible to Qatar business class passengers, massages for instance. Onboard, it was great however the selection of wines was better a few years ago. For instance, Pol Roger rosé was a better Champagne than Lanson.";POSITIVE

I had 6 meals on this trip, sampled the first, picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. Only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups, napkins. Since I had a window seat, I did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. They were good about handing out water - just not about collecting it. A340 had the shortest legroom I have experienced, my seat back was short and uncomfortable and the bathroom nearest me ran out of water early into the flight. I needed Wi-Fi from DOH to ATL but they did not offer any. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-11-08;" |  Manchester to Auckland via Doha legs seemed to be older planes, with seats in pairs rather than singles on an angle. Food was okay. I was looking forward to a cold beer but only 2 options of lager which is my last resort. The staff were all very attentive. Return flight Auckland to Doha had same pod set up which was again disappointing. The Doha to MAN leg actually had a newer plane, quieter and with individual pods - significantly better all round. I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive. On the last leg on the newer plane I had the problem of not being able to turn the headphone volume down enough, changing headphone set made no difference. Ended up having to have the headphone half open on my ears to reduce the volume. No one else seemed to have an issue. ";POSITIVE

Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy. Economy upper deck on the A380 is difficult to beat. My first time on the 777-300ER with 3-4-3 seating and pleased it was pretty empty because I can imagine it would be pretty cramped when full.";POSITIVE

Doha Airport looked fantastic but organisationally it was a bit haphazard.

The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one.

Even after I spoke with Duty Officer and explained I need to be at work tomorrow, they didn't help. My original tickets were for Business Class from Baku and First Class from Doha, but when I came to Airport for a flight booked for me, staff issued me Economy Class ticket for my flight from Doha. When I asked why, they said the QA system now shows Economy Class. It took me some time to prove that my original cancelled flight was for First class. I decided to speak with the Manager in Baku airport and she advised me to write to Customer Care.

Almost every few seats have a dedicated stewardess who pampers you all throughout the 12-13 hours. My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times. However, Qatar has to be sensitive to Business travellers who prefer to travel alongside other serious business travellers and not passengers who are noisy and get tipsy halfway through the flight. Will stop flying Business on Qatar if they don't profile passengers before upgrading them to higher class of travel.";NEGATIVE

Upon my arrival in Doha, I was called to the gate desk so they could ensure my luggage went on the plane with me. I've never experienced this before with any other airline. On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago. My connection was tight but they made it happen... AND changed my seat allocation so I could have 3 seat empty seats for my transatlantic flight.

We are Gold Privilege members (only relevant for the lack of care shown for a frequent business class traveller). On October 22nd, the day before my flight, I went online to on Qatar's website to check my seat selection was still valid. I hadn't received any notifications by text, email or via the Qatar app on my phone, yet online, there was a warning box showing that my itinerary had been changed. I had been bumped from the quick connection (1 hour 10m) in Doha onto a flight which left an hour and a half later. My arrival time at LHR would now be 10pm instead of 8.25pm. a real inconvenience for me. As it was Sunday afternoon in Bali, there was no office open to call and ask why the change. I tried the London and Doha offices. both were closed. The flight I had been bumped off was still being advertised online as being available to book, but I could do nothing, so I spent an hour making arrangements involving costly calls to the UK from Bali. I checked in early the next day and asked at the desk to put me back on the original flight. At first, the desk staff said they could not help me and I'd have to speak to the transfer desk in Doha, but once the question of which flight my bag would be checked to, came up (with me refusing to allow it to be on the later flight),  they were able to check me on to the earlier flight. I lost all my seat selections with a change of aircraft, and ended up on the undesirable window seats on both legs of the 777-300. The stewardess told me that the aircraft was changed 3 weeks before the flight. again, there was no notification about the change and that my allocated seats were no longer available. Neither of my two legs had internet on board. My arrival in Doha was delayed by half an hour so I had 40 minutes, along with 21 other passengers, to get to the next flight. We made it easily. however, I deeply regret getting onboard for the following: The mystery of being bumped was solved. much of the aircraft's business class section was occupied by a local family along with their appallingly behaved children of various ages. For 7 hours, non-stop, we were bombarded by toddlers running around or screaming to each other across rows of seats, by their staff running in and out of economy trying to control the children, by people swapping seats constantly and by members of the family bringing more toddlers and babies from other cabins to socialise. This wasn't a business class experience. it was being in a creche for a day. The cabin crew were beside themselves with trying to control the situation.  A complaint raised yesterday received a reply quoting terms and conditions only, so we will take our business elsewhere.";NEGATIVE

The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on  A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home. Similar experience at Bangkok, early check-in for flights and fast track through passport control the new Qatar lounge isn't open yet so still using one or other of two Thai Airways lounge noticed they've removed the TV screen since me previous visit which only ever had CNN. Still the world's best airline by far with the finest staff on the ground and in the air.";POSITIVE

There was no entertainment system on board but you had 15 min of free WiFi. They served very tasty food and drinks. The seat wasn't so comfortable because you didnt have much space. The transfer at Hamad Airport was fast. The flight to Frankfurt was operated with a A350-900 from LATAM Airlines. The Services was great but the snack and the breakfast was only okay. There was no WiFi and the entertainment system is not as good as on Qatar Airways own aircrafts. The seats were good and you had enough legroom including a footrest. So all in all it was two good flights but I was disappointed that the LATAM aircraft was not as comfortable as Qatar's A350.";POSITIVE

But the flight got delayed by 3 hours due to late aircraft arrival and I missed my boat transfer. Qatar Airways ground agents told me to book a hotel in Male and take the next day transfer and get reimbursed the fees. I had to stay an extra night in Male due to this delay it made sense to me that Qatar Airways will pay the additional cost. So I submitted the hotel receipt to Qatar Airways but the customer service agent replied that they will not reimburse the additional cost incurred due to this delay. This is unacceptable as I followed what their agent told me to do. ;NEGATIVE

At arrival in DOH they speeded up the security process for transferring passengers to QR flight to DWC, as the original 20 minute delay from Athens was not entirely covered and there was a bus transfer at DOH (taking more time than a bridge). Overall, an airline offering very good service!";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-10-19;" |  Sofia to Hong Kong via Doha. I had the worst experience with staff at Doha Airport. I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it’s at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it’s before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn’t make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said ‘ok’ and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I’ve asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more.  She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then!  I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I’ve spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I’ve got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time. However, immigration did not let me through, they said I already used my one time visa, so I can’t go out again. ";NEGATIVE

Drinks plenty, however, only 1 brand of beer, red, and white were offered – it used to be at least two choices of each. A good product, despite it is significantly slowly deteriorating.

Qatar Airways London lounge is first rate, seriously good food, table clothes, table service, friendly professional staff and they even have magazines you want to read. When you get on the flight to Doha, the cabin is awesome - Q class, means you essentially have small area to yourself. Food on the plane on a par with Emirates, and the whole flight and approach of the staff really good. I am shortly flying business on BA to Toronto, I will report back on it, but am not optimistic.

Once we landed in Stockholm we went to collect our luggage however after waiting for half an hour it was announced om the speakers that our luggage was lost. We rushed to get this sorted as we were on our way to a wedding, QR said they'd do everything they could to deliver the luggage by the morning, however nothing ever arrived, we ended up missing the wedding, with no change of clothes and still no information about compensation. It is now a week later and we still don't have our luggage, a missed wedding and a ruined holiday spent worrying and on the phone without any help or contact from Qatar Airways. we have been given so many numbers and email addresses however no one ever responds and when you get in touch with customer service they just refer you to ground staff instead of giving any help.

Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented. On both flights, the toilets were kept very clean and stocked with toothbrushes and toiletries. All in all a totally different experience from the last time I travelled with Qatar, the cabin crew were exceptionally good.";POSITIVE

Seats were comfortable with room to get round the fully reclined seat of neighbouring passenger. Plenty of leg and arm room and the food and drink on offer was good. Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time, although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight. On this experience I would recommend Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE

Flight was good as always on Qatar Airways. Great personalized service, decent food, great seat and good IFE. Transfer at Doha airport was chaos at security check. Speak lane for priority pax could not be found. Qatars lounge is soulless. it was so crowded at 7 am, the waiting time for a shower was about an hour, and lines at the toilets about 15 minutes. I left after a few minutes since waiting at the gate was more relaxing. Flight to Singapore was great on a spanking new A350, lot more quiet and less dry than the Boeing 787 on the previous flight. Service was as always topnotch. Qatar is great in the air, but Doha airport is lacking basic facilities at its business class lounge, and has unorganized security checks for transit pax. I";POSITIVE

Travelled 1-way economy, previously denied upgrade to business as “no seats” available. However, they try to sell the business seats or upgrade for cash until last day. Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (“Q-credits”). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme. In Copenhagen QR uses Aspire, a third party lounge, one of the poorest lounges – no hot food, poor drinks etc. Boarding was easy and quick. At seat, pre-departure soft drinks were drink provided. No pre-departure champagne offered – only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless. Drinks and wine list were excellent, served upon take off with hot nuts and hot towels. New onboard is an Italian beer Peroni, which is quite good and tasty. Guinness, Stella Artois, and Corona have gone. The safety video has improved. The annoying charity collections on Educate a Child goes on, I am puzzled by this. Flight 75% full, in business 7 passengers. Good 4-star Hotel provided free of charge in Doha while waiting in transit (20 hours). This is not available for the very cheapest fares. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha always deliver. I sat in the champagne bar and ordered fish sandwich from the remote sandwich-café. They brought it within 5 Minutes despite the distance is 400 meters. Well done. The bartenders did not have their best day, but the visitors made up for it. I don’t like that some visitors paid tips to lounge staff. DOH-SGN: again upgraded using Q-credits two hours before departure: I did so as I realised that any seatblock would be impossible with only 10 vacant seats left in economy. Flight 95% full. Good FA team onboard, I was treated like a king, got double of everything (2 seats, 2 amenity kits, 2 pyjamas). Crew were very joyful, joking, focused, and in good shape – worked hard throughout the flight. Luggage delivered on the belt in Saigon within a few Minutes.

With all seats in the cabin taken, it felt hot and claustrophobic. Flight attendants were responsive and polite. An impressive large selection of movies available and I was able to catch up on some old Hitchcock classics. The food was unmemorable and the lamb dish was salty, the meat chewy. With meals available any time, flight attendants scurried around during much of the flight laying table cloth and cutlery, serving multi course meals and then clearing the table. Comfortable 180 degree seats with massage features. Nice hard shell amenities kit. Ample overhead stow space though hardly any space around your seat to keep your documents, personal electronic device, reading material or eye glasses.

There were several meal options per flight (move snacks, main meal, ice cream snack etc). The toilets and cabin were kept clean and lots of trays of water were served. The leg room was very problematic for me. On the leg from Auckland to Doha the air conditioning was not functioning properly for several hours making it uncomfortably warm during a very long bout of turbulence. From Athens to Doha the meal service was excruciatingly slow and the main meal was inedible. Our row were given the last of three meal choices (Chicken) as they had run out of everything else. The two people next to me complained and they somehow found a pasta and beef meal for them. All of us could not eat more than one fork full of our meals as they were completely dry and overcooked, and tasteless. The media service on the shorter legs was non existent. On the Doha to Auckland routes was okay as long as you don't mind having to see the same adverts in front of every media offering - aimed at residents of Doha. Movies were oddly curated.  The staff are lovely but is economy class a 5 star experience, no.";NEGATIVE

A small disappointment was that none of the four items I selected from the in-flight duty free catalog was available. I would also have liked the Indian government landing card provided on board as it would avoid some hassle before the immigration counter on arrival.

Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive. headset had a loose connection resulting in sporadic audio connection. Seat 18 J was broken so my family was split up. The USB connection did not work so I could not easily charge my phone. The seatbelt sign was on for over 3 hours of leg one so the coffee didn't materialize until I requested it.

All throughout the flight I was worried that if my luggage didn't come with me what I would wear. The flight was very smooth. The cabin service was great. Food was excellent. Flight was on time.

Following check-in which offered no hint of a problem, I proceeded to the lounge first and then the gate close to the scheduled departure time. At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned.

I would like to particularly thank one cabin staff who served me on flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur with her gentle voice and pleasant smile. She made me feel right at home upon stepping into the aircraft with her exceptional service.  I would also like to note that the take-off and landing both times were flawless. Thumbs up to the captain. The Godiva chocolate is a nice touch. Without a doubt, I would choose to fly with Qatar again. Can't wait to experience their QSuites. Things that they may improve: - Food: vegetables looked and tasted over cooked. I also had the chicken gnocchi, they were mushy and soft.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-09-06;" |  Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha. I used to fly British Airways 3 or 4 times a year between Muscat and Edinburgh but considering the visible decline in both aircraft quality and service now being offered by BA I decided to try Qatar Airways. The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-31;" |  Tokyo to London via Doha. Not impressed, a new aircraft with a cramped cabin. I found the seats not very comfortable and the cabin service was not great. The meal quality was okay and drinks selection limited. Boarding the plane in Tokyo and Doha was fine, but getting through transfer in Doha was a time consuming and a rugby like exercise.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-30;" |  Bangkok to Milan via Doha, returning from Rome. Check in was a breeze, and I waited only 5 minutes.  I was greeted by the cabin senior, who was polite and welcoming. This flight was about 85% full. I was seated where the second cabin senior with 12 years' experience was in charge of, he was polite and observant. He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and  overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional.  On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic. After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for. Before landing, he asked me if wanted to try the business class seats. On the flight to Bangkok, it was another 777, and the crew were still excellent. Excluding disorganised ground staff, Qatar is an excellent choice. ";POSITIVE

On this flight, although I flew in economy class with duration of almost 16 hrs I still enjoyed the experience. Cabin crew deserve the full respect from me.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-28;" |  Flew New York JFK to Doha. It has been several years since I have flown Qatar Airways, and my first experience on the A350. The standard of cabin service is still very high as is the delicious catering, the IFE on the A350 is a bit iffy, especially the TV selection and games are very poor. The flight tracker and cameras are of the highest quality. I plan to bring back my loyalty to Qatar Airways but stick to their 777s in the future.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-22; |  Istanbul to Adelaide via Doha returning from Sydney.Flights were on time. Planes were tidy and clean. Seats were comfortable. Foods served was ordinary and below my expectation. There were plenty of options in the entertainment system but I expected better films. The most challenging task for me was online check in as I got error message and could manage to complete the checking after countless attempts. Overall the flights were OK and value for the money. ;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-18;" |  First time flying with Qatar Airways, Melbourne to Belgrade, Rome to Melbourne and won't be the last time. Aircraft was spotless the attendants were very courteous, friendly and professional. All spoke excellent English. The entertainment unit is fantastic, clear and very responsive, extensive movies, music, TV series, games and live maps more then you could possibly want and will keep you occupied. The distance between seats is very good even for a 185cm tall person like me could stretch out with room to spare. With around 500 passengers on board the A380 boarding and disembarking was quick. Refreshments were served periodically between meals which were all good as well. Highly recomend Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-17; |  Denpasar to Berlin via Doha in July 2017. This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that. ;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-16; |  Auckland to Warsaw via Doha. Very good customer service on board however before no way I could get an answer to my questions. I found the food awful especially from Auckland.  It is the shame such a big airline to serve such horrible food!;NEGATIVE

At the time of booking we contacted Qatar Airways customer service to ask if we could avail of their complimentary hotel stay in the airport for our long layover. We were told that we could avail of this service on the day we arrive in Doha by a customer service representative on the phone. On arrival in Doha today we were told that our fare was promotional and we are not eligible for the hotel, meaning we are stuck in the airport for the next 16hrs. The staff were  unapologetic and offered us no alternatives other than paying for hotels with our own money. The flight was disappointing WITH mediocre food and hard seats. The only staff who were very nice and helpful were at the city tour desks. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-10;" |  Flew Edinburgh to Melbourne Australia via Doha. The staff on Qatar Airways have to be commended. They work so hard and never seem to stop the whole time and every one of them do so with a smile on their faces. Comfortable flight, food comes non stop with snacks and refreshments in between main meals. This is the second long haul round trip I've had with Qatar and I'll certainly be flying with them again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-09;" |  I was scheduled to fly yesterday from Atlanta to Chennai via Doha. After all check-in, security clearance process, I was informed that the flight is cancelled while boarding. They didn't send any notifications to mobile or email. They said we need to rebook for next available flight and asked us to check out all luggages. I checked out and was waited at the booking counter line for 2 hours. For the entire Atlanta International airport, they had only one booking counter open and one booking agent available. After one hour of waiting, I got frustrated and called their customer service while staying on the line. I was on call-wait status for 50 minutes before getting hold of someone in their customer service. Customer service agent couldn't rebook me on next day flight unless I'm ready to do a 3 stopper instead of 1 stopper that I booked. I got the same itinerary 2 days later and asked him to book it. He couldn't book me because I was already checked-in and they needed me checked out from airport side. He said he will do all that and call + email me later with confirmation. I never received any call or email till today. I called their customer service again and was able to get hold of someone after 30 minutes wait. I got the same answer today as well. They have asked me to call them again after 4 hours. Not sure how long I should be on hold to get hold of them. And their website still shows the flight status as delayed and not as cancelled. I still didn't receive any delay/cancel notification from them. This is one of the worst experience I had. They are completely understaffed and don't infrastructure in place to handle delays/cancellations. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-08;" |  Booked 2 seats at the same time through an agency as British Airways codeshare flight, but couldn't sit together. Couldn't make changes online, couldn't get thru to call centre and no response from message on Twitter. Got to Heathrow and one very helpful member of staff tried her best but ultimately ineffective. Consequently one of us ended up sitting front of plane and other at rear. Seat cramped I'm only 5'10"" yet my knees were sticking into the reclined seat of the person in front. Took two hours for a drink to be served. Staff all very friendly but not a great experience. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-07; |  New York to Bangkok via Doha. Qatar Airways aircraft was new and impressive but the seat had problems with reclining. Entertainment was as good as other major airlines. The food was surprisingly good. The main issue I had was my flight attendant never smiled. Service is everything on my trips and other attendants didn't smile or greet me as I entered or departed the aircraft. ;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-07;" |  Berlin to Singapore via Doha. Not the first time I fly Qatar. This is a really good airline. Friendly staff, comfy seats and fab food and drinks. Qatar really has that old fashioned feel of a bit of luxury when travelling. The quality of all they do is awesome. The only thing that irritates me somewhat is that the screen in front of you points to Mecca the whole time. And they recommend that you listen to the Qoran while flying. I prefer to travel religion free. On the minus part. WiFi was expensive.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-06; |  Doha to Yangon. No inflight entertainment which is a big deal when traveling with my 9 year old son. We had nothing to do during our 7 hours fight. The legroom was limited. For 6 economy class there were only two toilets available and a long queue on the passager walkway. The food was also not appealing to me and limited choice. I will never ever fly with this airline again. ;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-08-03;" |  Stockholm to Bangkok via Doha. Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour. Meals were good, staff were great - very friendly, toilets were always clean. However I've cancelled my return flights in April 2018 taking the $200 on tax refund and putting it towards another airline. Qatar need to address the seating on the 787 or at least remove the under seat IFE boxes. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-31;" |  Dubai to Singapore via Doha in May 2017. Excellent in every respect. Great end to end service, planes are clean and new, seats are large, crew efficient and very kind. The business class is not too crowded, the food is good. It overall scores higher as Emirates generally, apart from entertainment. IFE a bit limited and not that user friendly. Food is porbably the best across all the airlines I have ever tried.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-28;" |  I had to go to Doha for business and of course I chose Qatar Airways, and it was such a great experience. First of all, when I arrived to the Qatar Airways point to get my ticket staff were nice and helpful answering all my doubts. Then onboard the airplane the cabin crew were nice offering different snacks and beverages. I used the inflight entertainment offered and the flight went by quickly. The only thing I think they could improve was the wifi, I never got connected.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-28;" |  Flew Qatar Airways from Dhaka to Larnaca via Doha. Service has definitely improved on Dhaka routes! Check-in process at the counter also improved at Dhaka airport. Inflight food and service were great, staff were amazing. For the vegetarian food, it always seems that on board vegetarian options are always much better than the pre-order ones, lacto-vegi here! Inflight entertainment, was ok but not that many good options, Tedtalks were good. For this routes some music from Tagore classics would be great on flights. Overall great service.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-25;" |  Hong Kong to London via Doha. Staff extremely good but food and seat in Business just okay. Business Class lounge in Doha excellent, but food quality and quantity slipping. I booked a twelve hour stopover in Doha but Qatar Airways did not grant me a free visa (I tried to get it online and then called). I decided to remain in the lounge and worked and the staff was exceptional. Inconsistency seems to be what I notice and I do not consider it a 5 star Airline. The seat in business on a 787 is claustrophobic. Their big asset is their staff. I will still use them because of prices and transit in Doha is smooth.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-24;" |  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha. This was my first trip with Qatar Airways and normally using Emirates for this route. It was a nice surprise and for me much better than Emirates, better cabin service and a nicer transfer time between the flights. Food was fair for economy class, great choice of inflight programmes, movies etc, and seat comfort felt better than Emirates Boeing 777 and the A380. Cabin attendants were polite on both sectors, polite and efficient - and not to overpowering or fake. Transfer time in Hamad airport was pleasant, nice shops, some comfortable places to seat and rest. Have my return flights to look forward to.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-23;" |  Adelaide to London via Doha in business class. Absolutely fabulous experience, flew their A350 to Doha and A380 onwards to London. Ground service was efficient, and transfer in Doha was pleasant. A great lounge there but a bit crowded when we can through - nice wines and food though. The seats were really comfortable, and provided nice privacy and comfortable sleep experience compared to others flown recently. Onboard meals were nice, beautifully presented and very good quality, with again some really nice wines. Inflight entertainment had a very wide choice of movies and tv programmes, and it was just the repetitive adverts that annoyed. Cabin crew were efficient and nice on both flights, probably better on the A350 where they didn't seem so rushed. In my opinion this was more comfortable and enjoyable than our usual trip we make with Singapore Airlines, and looking forward to our return flights next month.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-23;" |  Zurich to Adelaide via Doha. The business class cabin of A350 is airy, the seats are comfortable to sit on, but uncomfortable in bed position. The food choices were very limited although nicely presented. I had four meals, two mains were good, one was cold and one was overcooked. The entertainment system was disappointing, a very small number of new western movies, not a lot of choice in classical music and headphones of very poor quality. The cabin crew was mostly friendly, sometimes efficient, but often unknowledgeable. All in all a disappointing experience.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-22;" |  Berlin Tegel to Auckland via Doha. Price very good! Routing and timing brilliant - 24 hours with only one layover for a route that can be easily 36 hours. (Europe-NZ). 3 of the 4 departures were delayed, one would have blown my outgoing flight but Qatar had made my incoming flight earlier, just in case. At least one delay may have been due to heightened airport security at Tegel. Luggage all arrived okay. Food not exceptional. AV system- good selection, could not search movies by name. On the first flight, it was the previous month's selection - latest movies were not yet uploaded. On the last big sector the handset was broken and the touch screen had an intermittent fault and USB port was no-go so I could not charge my phone. Cabin crew dismissed the issue with the AV system. No major cabin issues. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-21;" |  Adelaide to Zurich via Doha on the new A350 with airy cabin lay out in Business. The seats are comfortable, the bed is big in size but not comfortable as some competitors. The food was rather limited and the same as on the flights from Europe  earlier: a disappointing experience. The Entertainment system had the same quality and quantity problem and deficiencies as on my flights to Australia one week earlier: limited western movies and classical music on offer and bad quality of head sets. Cabin crew was young and friendly, but inefficient. I enjoyed rather quite flights with no major turbulences but disappointment with food, entertainment and cabin crew.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-21;" |  Manila to Paris via Doha. Qatar Airways is in a class of its own! Everything is superb, from check in to the flights themselves. Oryx One is one of the top IFE systems I've experience, with nice movie and tv program selections. Manila to Doha flight, the plane used was Boeing 777-300ER. The flight was full and a red eye flight. Cabin Crew were very accommodating and friendly. The cabin crew won't disturb passengers who are sleeping. Food was served twice in the flight, one around 30 mins after take off and one 2 hours before landing. Food taste is ok, not that great but ok for airline food. For the Doha to Paris flight, the plane used was the A380 which is my favorite plane due to the comfort it gives to the passenger aside from being very quiet. This is where one flight attendant was a bit of a let down because she wasn't that accommodating and she speaks like she is a bit grumpy. Also, the food that I want (chicken) was short on stock so I chose fish which turned out ok. Overall, I still recommend Qatar Airways if you're coming from Southeast Asia or even East Asia going to Europe. It really deserves its 2017 Airline of the Year award!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-20;" |  Venice to Male via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways because of the lower pricing and good time schedule. The flight experience has been quite amazing even in economy class. The food was good, and beverage was served constantly during the flight to keep us hydratated. Crew on Qatar Airways is the best you can find, they are very polite and kind, treating you like a king in particular if you are a member of their frequent flyer program like I am. The aircraft on all four flight was an A330-200/300, and comfortable. On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft. Aircraft age was the main negative aspect of this trip, but on all four aircraft there was a wide selection of music, tv, film, games. All four flights were on time and ground service in Doha was good.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-19; |  Hanoi to Bangkok. Check in was simple and straight forward. The seat was comfortable and a light meal was served (this was a short flight). The cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The flight left and landed on time. Baggage was waiting by the time I got through Immigration. The flight was uneventful and the reviews matched my experience. I would fly Qatar Airways again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-18;" |  Perth to Milan via Doha using Qatar Airways. Check-in at Perth Airport was easy and seamless. I checked in online so I needed to do was to drop off my luggage at the airport. I have not flown Qatar Airways for more than a decade and I am really impressed with the improvements. Plenty of leg room and the seats are comfortable for both Perth to Doha (using B777-200) and Doha to Milan (A330-200). On both sectors, I was well taken care off. The cabin crew were really friendly and helpful. I am impressed even on economy class we were offered three different options for mains and there is always a vegetarian option which is really considerate of Qatar Airways. There are plenty of inflight entertainment to keep me occupied for the long hours flight and the inflight magazine, Oryx has plenty of interesting content to keep me entertained as well. Overall a good experience and I will recommend Qatar Airways to others.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-15;" |  I was seated in lower deck A380  economy cabin and I found the seat cramped and uncomfortable (32"" seat pitch).

qatar-airways;2017-07-14;" |  Sydney to Athens via Doha. We had an excellent trip on Qatar Airways overall. The tickets were among the cheapest available when we booked and the flight times were the quickest. The connection times through Doha were very quick. The airport in Doha was modern and easy to navigate. The plane seemed newer than Emirates which I flew with recently, however there were not enough toilets. The staff were excellent and the food was good. The vegetarian options were far better than Emirates. The red wine served in economy was surprisingly good. The seat was comfortable for economy and the leg room was better than I had expected. The entertainment was excellent with a good touch screen with a great range of options including kids movies, new release, classic movies and TV shows. On our connecting flight we flew on an A330 which seemed older and the screen was not touch screen but the options were identical.";POSITIVE

My wife felt slightly unwell during the first flight, likely due to altitude and hypoxia. however Qatar Airways was very helpful in getting her checked at the airport first by a paramedic and then in the airport clinic by the doctor. Later on they advised us to get further investigated and checked in a hospital, hence they arranged an ambulance, hospitalization, travel from hospital to hotel, arrangement of hotel and food vouchers on their own. It was really nice to have a feeling of being cared by the airline. Everyone was so humble and supportive. I could not have asked for a better service by the airline. Inflight was really good too. Nice comfy seats on Boeing 787 with good air pressure. I will recommend it completely. Thanks Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE

Nice and new aircraft with warm ambience inside the cabin, the light is soft and not too bright so during serving meal you can continue to sleep if you don't want to eat. There are 2-3 meals option so you choose, the meal taste is good. The space between the seat is wide enough, so you have more legroom. Stewardess is also very helpful, full attention, and friendly to the children, they gave my children toy so they can play during long haul flight. The amenities is almost complete they gave toothbrush, toothpaste, blindfold,earmuffs, and sock in nice wallet. I'm very satisfied with the service.";POSITIVE

Taking the opportunity of some promotion (2 for one), we indulged ourselves by flying business class of Qatar Airways between Doha and Bangkok on their A380 and we had an amazing experience. The magic starts at Doha Airport business lounge which is certainly one of a kind for its design and the level of service. The experience continues onboard with the business seats that offer extreme confort and privacy, and a wide choice of entertainment opportunities. The food was simply top notch with great wine selection. To stretch your legs you have the bar which offers a comfortable and relaxing setting. Great and attentive service on top of this. What more can you ask?";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-09;" |  Kuwait to New York via Doha. Kuwait to Doha was in economy class. I am a Platinum Privilege Club member with well over 2000 Points - which means I fly on Qatar a lot, usually at least 20-30 sectors a year, sometimes more. I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have  10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again. Flight home from New York was pretty much a mirror image, although the food was really not up to par with what I am used to on Qatar.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-07-06;" |  Bangkok to Warsaw via Doha. Qatar Airways keeps standard at the highest level. The seat arrangement is most comfortable among all business classes (1+2+1 for the aircraft I flew) and service reminds of a high class restaurant due to small but important details. Serving drinks in dedicated glassware instead of one uniform glass, food served on china plates instead of plastic trays, engaged and helpful staff, high quality cosmetics (maybe except of Armani sets handed out previously). The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off. Taking alcohol off view during Ramadan shouldn't be the case in the international air territory in a plane full of all the races.";POSITIVE

Leased A350 from LATAM on MAD-DOH sector was a step down from Qatar Airways own A350 product and first time that I've been so hot on a flight. Ticket prices and schedules are often competitive, at least for the two ultra-last-minute trips I've purchased this summer. You get what you pay for perhaps, which is just fine, but I don't understand the 5-star hype.";NEGATIVE

My husband is from England and I'm from Thailand. We fly very often out of the country. It was our honeymoon and the flight attendants starting with the ground lady in LA at the counter when we checked in and the crew members treated us so special. They have done a wonderful job. A big thank to all the crew members for making us feel so special with the cake & heart decoration before we landed and during the flight we got pampered. We would fly with Qatar again. Business class is surely such a treat! Keep up the excellent work! We will post the pictures on our social media. Thanks for the memorable experience Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE

This is the best airline I have flown, and I have travelled the world on many occasions. I was a bit sceptical on the Auckland to Doha journey (this being the longest flight in the world) but I need not have worried, as the time passed quickly thanks to the excellent cabin crew, regularity of good quality meals and beverages and the generous amount of leg room. I was lucky enough to be seated upstairs in Economy on the A380 to Heathrow. My return journey was just as good and I was again lucky enough to have 3 seats to myself on both the Heathrow to Doha flight and Doha to Auckland. Overall Qatar would be the top my list of airlines to fly again with and is definitely value for money.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-07-03;" |  First time on Qatar Airways from London to Bali via Doha and won't be the last - they are streets ahead with their business product over Emirates and Etihad. The lounge in LHR was top notch with an amazing a la carte service. Onboard the staff were super friendly and attentive with a high class of food. The bar at the back of the plane is great and service again exemplary. The seat was really comfortable - no complaints. On the second leg to DPS on the A330 I was expecting to be disappointed having just been on the A380. I was wrong, the service was even better. Massive smiles, nothing too much trouble, even profuse apologies for the selected red wine being too cold - now that's service. The whole outbound service blew me away. The one niggle is that the Oryx entertainment system lacks in the latest releases - now I feel I am being picky.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-30;" |  Melbourne to Athens via Doha. The cabin crew created a restful and friendly atmosphere. A number of children who were restless and tired while boarding quickly settled down when they received their activity packs. I found that the time of the first long leg passed quickly thanks to ambient lighting, attentive service and an entertainment system which worked without any problems. From Doha to Athens the flight attendant allocated to our seat was particularly helpful, responding courteously to special requests about meals and drinks. On both legs the plane was full but remained clean and orderly throughout. Passengers seemed aware of the need to make some variations to the flight path. As I had a window seat I got to see a most impressive snow capped mountain peak below. The minimal amount of time added was amply compensated for by the efficient way the flight crew managed boarding, disembarkation, take off and landing.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-29;" |  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly.  On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product. On the return leg, wifi wasn't working for much of the flight. Overall, it was totally a 10/10 flight, with the minor complaints about the experience at Bangkok airport. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-28;" | Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business Class. I flew Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha on the 787 Dreamliner first leg then A380 second leg. The 787 business cabin in excellent with plenty of space. The seats are 1-2-1 lie flat pod style all with aisle access. The service is always excellent, the staff are so well trained and always friendly, unlike Emirates. I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar. I've had many good times in this bar but I didn't use it this time. I agree with other reviewers that Qatar offers the best business class, mainly due to the excellent staff. Emirates should send a mystery shopper to see how it should be done.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-28;" |  Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business class. I flew Phuket to Birmingham via Doha on Boeing 777 first leg then Boeing 787 second leg. The first leg had an aircraft change from Boeing 787 to Boeing 777 which was good as the Boeing 777 business cabin in so spacious. You get a metre of leg room, enough room to stand up. The seats are 2-2-2 so we took 2 near the window. They're very big and comfortable and lie-flat. The service was excellent as usual, I had a lovely 4 course meal, soup, sea bass, chocolate cake & cheese board with 30 year tawny port. The movie choice is not so good, I couldn't find anything new to watch as I'd watched the 3 best movies on the outbound flight from BHX. We had 3 hours between flights in Doha, the lounge was virtually empty and they're weren't serving alcohol due to Ramadan to the dismay of several western travelers. I slept the entire second leg on the 787 but I've already reviewed that in a previous post. Congratulations Qatar, keep up the good work.";POSITIVE

Everything was overwhelming, but the crew and especially the purser on this flight deserve special mention, what an extraordinary level of anticipation of every possible wish. On boarding I mentioned that I would prefer a window seat, the purser went and asked every single passenger seated by a window if they would swap with me. The food was outstanding too, the seat on the B787 comfortable enough to sleep for almost the entire flight. Qatar Airways is unique, in a class of its own.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-06-18;" |  Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 15-16 June 2017 on B787 and A330 respectively. Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency. Children well cared for and given gifts and child meal given if requested prior to travel. Luggage handled well and all 4 pieces arrived to perfection at final destination.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-16;" |  Doha to Amsterdam. This aircraft is the one with the 24 seat business class cabin in a 2X2X2 seat format across. Older aircraft and seat width is not as wide as on the new A380 and A350 at around 20.5 inches for upper part and smaller at the lower section. Fully flat seat but the lower half of the seat has been forced down further from people sitting or putting weight on what is not a very sturdy part of the seat so the seat needed to be raised a little to get it into a comfortable flat bed. However, service was excellent, four crew for 24 passengers with eat when you want from the menu. Breakfast on offer out of Doha and light snacks and meals available then or later with wine etc. before arriving in Amsterdam. Tasty food, nicely presented.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-14;" |  May 12, flew ORD-DOH-DEL on QR 726/QR578 in Business Class. Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant. But their Business Class is the best of any airline in my opinion.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-12;" |  Doha to Manila. They have the best service in this airline. The crew is assistive and the meal was great. The boarding is fast and the seats are comfortable and IFE (inflight entertainment) is the best -  a lot of movie,audio and games selection.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-12;" |  Atlanta to Lagos via Doha. My 75 year old mother flew with Qatar and I was pleasantly surprised. Her lay over in Doha was overnight for about 12 hours or more and the last time they said the only hotel available inside the airport was full. This time we got the transit visa which was applied for on the website and was quickly processed and arrived before the 7 day published on the site. On arrival in Doha, Qatar Airways arranged for her transportation and escorted her to a nearby 4 star hotel, provided wifi, a dinner voucher, woke her up the next morning in time to get dressed, have breakfast and picked her up promptly for her onward journey. Hotel stay, food, and transportation for that night may have amounted to just about $125 which is a tiny fraction of her ticket cost but I am so impressed and grateful for the peace of mind l had that she was well taken care of. I will advocate for this airline any day. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-12;" |  Sydney to Doha. Business class was full but crew were very efficient, excellent service. Seats were comfortable and large touch screen tv for entertainment system. Food service was a late dinner out of Sydney and early breakfast into Doha. Qatar also allow you to stagger your dining, setting times for when you would like dishes served which means they will reserve one of these dishes for you. Food presentation and range of dishes are more premium economy but they are very tasty. Fully flat bed is comfortable, not as wide as on Singapore but they are comfortable in flat bed.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-11;" |  Belgrade to Doha. Belgrade's airport is small and you cannot get lost. Checking in was fast, but my passport needed several scans. First boarder control then security separate at each gate. Business lounge a kind of basic, but ok. First time on a Qatar Airways narrow body aircraft. 12 seats in a 2-2 configuration, seat the same as on the airline's A330-300. Very comfortable and fully flat, really big touch screens. Only the room for the feet on the 2C/D and 3C/D a little restricted for taller men. Amenity kit without cosmetics, but sufficient for a 4 hours 40 minutes flight time. Food and drink menu superbe as always. Not much difference in comfort in comparison to a wide body aircraft.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-06-11;" |  Qatars A350 service to London was faultless. In my view vastly superior to an A380 service - more personal and spacious. The blockade against Qatar means the flight was a little less busy, and even the airport was more quiet - but this made the experience even better! This was a wonderfull flight, and the route we flew was interesting - but did not seem any longer at all.";POSITIVE

My elderly father loved the hotel and we managed a scenic tour of the city , which we both enjoyed. Qatar Airways staff were friendly and wonderfully supportive. My father required wheelchair support, again all staff were professional and supportive. My elderly father thoroughly enjoyed his unexpective stop over.

Unlike Dubai's main airport, no queues at check-in, immigration or security. Limited but adequate eating - McDonalds and Costa Coffee - and shopping. Flight left Dubai 15 minutes early, unusually in my experience berthing at an airbridge on arrival Doha thus no requirement to join the hordes fighting through security. One of Qatar's ageing Airbus 330s for the flight to Chongqing so no Wifi or power at seat, but perfectly clean and seat comfortable enough for a few hours sleep. Service standards are not stellar - wet wipe rather than hot towel and no boiled sweets - but still superior in comparison to others. Particularly like the regular rubbish collection. Food adequate. Longish bus ride from plane to terminal with bags arriving on clearing immigration.";POSITIVE

Limited map functionality on the A350 aircraft. Courteous, well trained and hard working cabin crew. All flights on time and smooth transfer. Smaller portions of main meals but sufficient. Really strange snacks (looking like substance of plastics once they get cooler). IFE interupted by a message asking to offer a prayer during the flight (encouraging especially during bumpy rides). Rare combination of comfortable flying and reasonable value for money.";POSITIVE

There was some screens playing a movie, but my sound was not working. The food provided is very nice. I would avoid flying them again.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-05-26;" |  Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset.  The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad.  For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food. These were sale flights I booked and I don't know whether I would fly them again.";NEGATIVE

It was the third time, that I was overwhelmed by the quality of their product and the improvements. Qatar now has a branded Lounge in Dubai T1, calm, spotless and much more pleasant. On bord, it's not only the sophisticated seat (787), the low number of seats per toilet, the meal on demand-service or food and drinks (they serve Guinness!) that are special. My favourite part are the crews, who really hit the spot. They have an incredibly high level of anticipation of what you may want at every moment of the flight. Even when the cabin is fully booked, they maintain the level. For me, Qatar Airways is a class of its own.";POSITIVE

We were given lounge access (elite flyer), plenty of seats on board, and received good service throughout. Flights on time. Food on 1st sector was good with three full dinner options. Flight from DOH-CPH was a night flight: no dinner was provided - only a night-sandwich handed out - they have become inedible over the last 1-2 years where they initially were good when launched in 2014. Breakfast was offered 4-5 hours later - but options were all extremely poor and no meat dishes offered (apart of a ridiculous chicken sausage) at all. Drinks offered were plenty.

Meals are very small and the light meal / snack is always the same: a hot baked thing (sweet or savoury option) which they call a sandwich but is something different, with a small, poor cake.

qatar-airways;2017-05-09;" |  London to Khartoum via Doha on Qatar Airways. My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.";POSITIVE

The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again.

Check in at CPT was quick but not much other interaction from the agent security was fairly quick, Qatar use the Bidvest lounge which was okay with food and drink on offer enough seating too. Boarding was a little slow I think due to the late arrival of the the aircraft but once on board the crew where responsive polite offering drinks amenity kits and menus. Flight departed around 30 minutes late I was in seat 2A which was very comfortable once airborne meal orders taken drinks offered and an apology for the late departure from the crew manager. Food was pretty good as was the service, I managed some decent sleep during the 9hrs 20min flight the entertainment system was okay but not very responsive. Arrival in Doha on time to a remote stand business class passengers bussed separately to the terminal, I used the Qatar lounge which is very good although huge it feels fine. Boarding from A3 on to the LHR flight was organised I had seat 22A on this flight which I like at the rear of business cabin. Again crew very responsive offering PJs night kits drinks etc. Departed on time although I skipped food and opted for breakfast 2 hours before arrival. I slept for 4 hours of this night flight woke by the crew to a pretty good breakfast about 2 hours out of LHR. Flight arrived almost 1 hour early which was nice bags off quickly I was home within an hour of landing. Great service I prefer the A380 to other Qatar aircraft although not used A350 yet.

I would like to highlight one experience i had with them when i last flew with them in February 2017. The return flight from CCJ to DOH did not have a flight entertainment system and I did not get the food i had requested for. The staff are amazing. On my return I tweeted to Qatar Airways regarding the issues I faced and they were quick to respond to my query and assist. They were very apologetic for the mix up regarding the food and also made a reasonable explanation as to why there was no entertainment system on the return flight. They awarded me 3000 QMiles for the inconvenience caused. Thank you Qatar Airways for an amazing experience !;POSITIVE

The seats 2-2-2 setup were not as comfy as I was expecting and did not recline to full flat. The entertainment system had sound issues. The breakfast out of Colombo was not impressive.

As a Gold Member for the past three years, Qatar Airways standards remain high when it comes to safety, professionalism, cleanliness, punctuality, and they are really trying hard to ensure passengers comfort. They crew are friendly and competent, food and wine is very good. ground assistance is good, they take care and ensure you board the flight when the time on the ground between flights is rather short. If we really wish to knit pick we could ask for an added mattress during overnight long flights or an L size of the grey pijama : the XXL given if oversize for most.";POSITIVE

Hand-luggage was weighed. Boeing 777 was new and cramped with a 3x4x3 seat configuration, I saw a little amount of lavatories. Menu was average nothing worth of mentioning. Seat width feels narrow to me. Inflight entertainment ok. Service understaffed to my eyes. Doha Airport was stressful for me, and unwelcoming. The premium classes may be worth of travel - the Economy is definitely not considered the current alternatives.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-04-26; |  Dubai to Amritsar via Doha. Flight from Dubai to Doha on A350 was comfortable. Flight Attendant smiling and attentive. Hot Snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight. Hence a quick busy shuttle flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient. After reaching Doha moved to Departure Hall. Hamad airport is dark and not properly lighten up.  Our onward flight to Amritsar was from gate C24 which is on the ground level. The place looks does not provide good travel experience. Boarding started zone wise an hour earlier but still bit chaotic. We are bussed to the aircraft. The aircraft was A321 which is full. The seats were not more than average and feel bit cramped.  Refreshing towel pack handed out but no menus were given.  Drinks are served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served is not up to 5 star mark and average. It took a long time for flight attendant to serve the meal and to take away trays after finishing the meal. The flight departs at 02:20 am and reaches by 08:15 am. It would be better and appropriate if they serve breakfast on this sector rather than serving dinner. There was a long queue for going to washroom after the meal. The good thing about this flight is that it departed on time and reached on time that too 10 minutes early and inflight entertainment was good.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-04-26;" |  Amritsar to Dubai via Doha. Flight from Amritsar to Doha on A321 which was well maintained and legroom was good. The boarding started an hour earlier but not done zone wise and took almost 30 minutes to board the plane. No greetings from crew when boarded. The A321 is full and it would be better, if they deploy a bigger aircraft. The flight attendants were just doing their job and not smiling. Refreshing towel pack handed out and menus were given. Drinks served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served out of Amritsar was not up to 5 star mark and very average dinner. Veg Biryani with one small teaspoon of lentils and tasted bland. Desert of Mango Kheer tasted better. The main course is small. No tea or coffee served after the meal and you have to ask for this. Inflight entertainment was good. But the touch screen option takes longer time to do the action assigned. The good thing about this flight is that it departed 10 minutes before time and reached 20 minutes ahead of its scheduled arrival time. On reaching Doha, bussed to the arrival hall which is just 5 minutes ride. As there is no other flight arrival quickly pass through security for transits and then straight to departure hall. Flight to Dubai on A321 was comfortable. Flight attendants were smiling, attentive and doing their job with passion. Considering it a 5 star airline, no water or welcome drink was served, but a hot snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight. Hence a quick busy shuttle flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient.";POSITIVE

The flight to Doha was very good. Once again the food was lovely and the plane comfortable. The host on my side was talking a bit casually and not as professional as others, but the one on the side of my fiancée was extremely polite. The A330 to Athens also nice and comfortable and the staff very attentive. All in all a great journey.";POSITIVE

First leg of the flight was on a A320 with the old layout of business class seats which are the worst from what Qatar has to offer as they don't go into bed mode and aren't as nice as the newer ones, but it was ok for a 4.5 hour flight. Service was good and so was the food offered. On the second leg of the flight we flew on the Boeing 787. Indeed a spectacular aircraft with great layout, vey comfortable seats. The amenities given along with slippers, and pyjamas were top quality. The staff were very attentive and again everything was perfect from start to finish, Can't fault it.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-04-24;" |  Dammam to Manila return via Doha. I have been flying with Qatar Airways, particulary on the Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Manila, for a couple of years now in business class with much satisfaction. Each year, some additional nuances are added to make the flight more pleasurable. This last flight was on seat 2A (Dammam-Doha, A330-200) and 2K (Doha-Manila-Doha, B777-300ER) and 2A (Doha-Dammam, A320).  Cabin crew make extra efforts to provide passenger's needs anytime. Food options are very good. One note however, I still prefer the Armani amenity kit of the past rather than the latest one. I suppose Qatar Airways would like to consider utilizing a newer aircraft on certain days like the A350 or Boeing 787-8 on their Manila route (or Southeast Asian route generally).";POSITIVE

The check-in on Munich Airport was very fast and easy, but the first flight was operated on a LATAM Brasil A350, which was less comfortable than proper Qatar aircraft. The meal aswell as the service on board was quite good, but not better compared to other airlines. Doha Airport was really great and modern, but because of the big delay, I didn't have that much time on the airport. The second flight was pretty similar to the first one, but luckily it was operated by a Qatar Airways A340-600 and the legroom there was pretty huge. All in all the flights on Qatar Aiways were pretty good and comfortable.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-04-20;" |  Madrid to Manila via Doha. Our inbound Iberia flight was delayed. It was a race against time. Upon deplaning, to the luggage belt and me up to the check in counter for our flight to Doha on Qatar Airways. When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well. When I try to look back, I gave ourselves allowance of almost three hours for our flight to Manila. Should Iberia did not bump us off, all should've gone smoothly as planned. I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this. I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable. To the QR check in staff who assisted us, I was not able to get your name at that time but I would always be thankful for making it possible for us to get on our flight. You deserve my commendation for a job well done.";POSITIVE

The cabin looked modern and neat, the cabin lighting set a soothing and relaxed atmosphere on board. Seats were quite comfortable, legroom was okay but overall the seat width felt narrow and cramped. Cabin crew were very professional and friendly. Meal quality was good given the cabin flown but in comparison to other airlines, the amount of drinks offered was insufficient in relation to the length of the flight. The in-flight entertainment offered was good, although the system was not intuitive and touchscreen seemed to react slow. Liked the goodie of 15 minutes complimentary on-board wi-fi!";POSITIVE

Lounge in Ho Chi Minh City is very good (Apricot, 3rd part lounge) since renovation recently. I was the only visitor for the entire 3 hours when I was there. Food options delicious, drinks OK, but the wines were useless. Good catering and pre-departure drinks, but the flight is so short that there is no food provided and no food is available except some sweet cookies and nuts. FAs were kind and gave me extraordinarily a free amenity kit as I inquired for - but these are normally not given on short flights. Flight was early and arrived 20 Minutes ahead of schedule. I will travel economy on this route next time as the flight seems always empty. Or, go by the big detour with Malaysia Airlines over Kuala Lumpur for much less (if campaign prices).";POSITIVE

Marco Polo Lounge in Venice with a nice design and typically Italian but basic food options. A330-200 with the older type of seats, which are in my opinion, although many writers here disagree, very comfortable and no problem to find several hours of sleep. It has not to be totally flat! A380 seat comfort a little better, more personal space and also good sleeping fully flat sleeping position. The only thing I would advise Qatar Airways to review and find a better supplier, is the coffee, awful on both legs.";POSITIVE

All flights were on-time, food was very good, planes clean and service provided by FAs was great in every aspect, from friendliness to smiles.

qatar-airways;2017-04-13;" |  Manila Clark to Madrid via Doha. This was the first time for us to fly out of Doha. We utilized the complimentary shuttle service at the Trinoma pick up point. There were just a handful of passengers so the bus ride was fine. Check in at CRK airport was okay although there was a glitch in terms of the seat assignment. When I purchased the tickets, I made sure seat assignments were reserved and confirmed. Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg. I find it exasperating as my partner and I were traveling together yet we were situated in seats far from each other. What's the point of pre-selecting seats? Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers. Anyhow, in-flight service was superb. The cabin crew took heed of my specific requests. It was great as it was dining-on demand. Meal service was spotless. I had to stay up the whole flight to shun away from jetlag. Thanks to binge watching Modern Family and Friends on Oryx.";POSITIVE

Lack of a cheese plate flying GYD - DOH and BKK - DOH is unforgiveable. The saving grace is the cabin crew who are usually very good.";NEGATIVE

Very comfortable flight all around and was able to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea in flight with no issues which was why I chose the Qatar option in first place (787s all the way). Only criticism would be the IFE touch screen was very sluggish and the children's meals were drab plus no play packs for kids. On arrival at Doha had long walk carrying kids. Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep. Again kids meal were drab and left though IFE worked better. Overall the Boeing 787 was brilliant and justified my route a choice but Boeing 777 cancelled this out.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-31;" |  Barcelona to Bangkok return via Doha. Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz.  Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck. Cannot speak for other carriers, but the difference on QR between their A380 offering and the 773 offering is embarrassing. ";NEGATIVE

The check in took almost 30 minutes which is not acceptable, and the third party facility in Colombo is really not up to Qatar Airways standards. Otherwise a lovely Inflight experience. Pre take off dinks individually taken and offered. Dine on demand menu is more than adequate for a 5 hour flight and executed faultlessly. The food was not that tasty and I was surprised.

qatar-airways;2017-03-27;" |  London to Denpasar Bali via Doha,  returning Jakarta to London via Doha. Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered. Overall, very impressed with the service that Qatar offers, and would certainly consider using them again flying to Asian destinations if the price is competitive with (e.g.) Singapore Airlines.";POSITIVE

The snacks were paltry and seats were no more than average. It was about the best entertainment system I've seen on long haul flights. My pillow went below my bottom instead of my head the seat was so uncomfortable.  The flights from Doha to Bangkok had particularly bad food, no middle eastern food was offered which I found strange. My chicken and potatoes with vegetables reminded me of a discount meal. The lounge had good food and a nice shower, but had a smoking room coupled with poor ventilation. On 3 of the 4 flights you could get 15 minutes of free internet, after which it cost 20 USD for 200 mb. Quite expensive for Internet onboard these days.  Too bad, I had such high hopes.";NEGATIVE

To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger.  This was the second plane change for the worse in 5 months.";NEGATIVE

I love this aircraft's cabin air quality. The seat is great and the 1-2-1 Business cabin is cosier than Qatar's A350 or 380. It left right on time. The Doha to London sector was a 777 with an older 2-2-2 layout and product, which my partner and I are usually quite happy with. But it does look and feel dated, compared with the latest Qatar Airways Business product. My seat seemed to dangle at the end, so didn't go completely flat. Still, this aircraft type will shortly be retrofitted with Qatar's latest Q Suite. Catering was good, in that as an alternative to the main breakfast offering, there were also several delicious alternatives. Cabin crew were excellent. The only issue was the frustrating 30 minutes holding before landing at Heathrow. But we still made it to the gate on time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-18;" |  My last flight from Doha to New York JFK was disappointing. Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced. None of this is tragic and I very much realize the ""Let them eat cake"" aspect of such criticism.

Boarding fast and organized. Seat on both flights identical, the great herringbone seats. Very comfy with lots of storage space. Service impeccable, food ex Brussels very average, slightly better ex Doha. Doha lounge massive, with good drinks, but average food. The place lacks soul. I had the chance to compare the B787 and A350 here, and the 350 wins with flying colors. Much quieter than the Boeing 787, the air is significantly less dry, the window shields more sophisticated, and even the toilet flush worked better. It feels more spacious and elegant than the 787.

The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don’t mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard, despite business class was full. Good food, excellent wines, poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the “Educate a Child” charity. They want people to put money in envelopes onboard! I find this extremely intrusive and disrespectful to passengers.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2017-03-10; |  Colombo to London via Doha. The sector from Doha to London was flawless on an A380-800. The flight took off and arrived on time. In-flight services were very good. The seating was 3x4x3 and there were plenty of toilets. The flight attendants were attentive without being overwhelming. Altogether a good flight. The Colombo to Doha sector on an A340 with 2x4x2 seat configuration had a few problems. Although I had checked in online I had to join the queue to drop my bag off. I could not see the point of checking-in online. The check-in/bag drop girl spoke in phrases and not in sentences. Boarding was rather chaotic but I presume that this is mostly to do with the airport staff at Colombo. The flight departed 1 hour and 10 minutes late after boarding and because of a thunderstorm. CMB-DOH sector not good but DOH-LHR sector was very good.;POSITIVE

The flight was late and they advised on air to the airport that we would be late. Chief of cabin talked Portuguese, made us feel confortable with the delay, the Boeing 787 is a fantastic plane lots of seat space and does not seem to end the trip so tired. The inflight entertainment stills has a way to go against the competitors";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-10;" |  Nice boarding in Madrid, very nice flight but flight attendent seems to be flying for the first time. My wife asked for a Low Fat Meal, we had to tell her both times that we had that meal, because somehow she seems to forget, nevertheless she had the seat number on the tray. This was on the Madrid to Doha Flight, the flight to Hong Kong was regular but I like the IFE better on Emirates, better tech on the Qatar but less choice.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-10;" |  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Before my flight, I have spoken to their Twitter. They respond within an hour, and if they don't, they apologise. During check in, it was chaotic and took me an hour. I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic.  Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy.  She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the  red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers. Overall, an amazing experience unlike any other airline. I look forward to flying Qatar Airways business class in the future, when I save up! ";POSITIVE

Were one of the first to board and were given hot towels and welcome drink. Air hostesses were very attentive and polite. Since this was an early morning flight were given breakfast which was of high quality. I recommend Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-09;" |  London Heathrow to Doha. Business Class in the A350 most the best compared to its competitors. The service from check in to the lounge up to the gate was excellent. Staff were very apologetic of the short delay from London and again due to missing out on the pre takeoff drink, which was offered to me after takeoff the air hostess apologised for the inconvenience. This aircraft has a 2 class configuration (Economy and Business) and they take customer service to the next level. Food was great and actually tasted great for airline food, especially the dessert. The full flatbed seats were in a 1x2x1 layout and were very comfortable.";POSITIVE

We were on row 50 as we had an infant with us, the leg room was good for economy and near to the rest rooms. Service and staff attitude was excellent. Breakfast was okay and probably on par with Emirates.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-09; |  Riyadh to Doha. Nice experience and can say Qatar Airways lived up to its expectation as a 5 star airline. Food was good and we were given the seat preferences as per check in. Flight was a little delayed due to late passengers but did not affect me as the connecting flight was later.;POSITIVE

The flight crew made me feel very welcome, so friendly and happy, and the flight manager was caring about the passenger one by one, she was smiling and offering to help with genuine smile and professional manner. The seat is amazingly comfortable and the entertainment is superb, the food is perfect and more than enough.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-09;" |  Frankfurt to Windhoek return via Doha. Economy from Frankfurt to Doha was in a new A350. The seats were acceptable, large screen, but the movie program was a disappointment. I found the food horrible. Crew was very nice. Arrival in Doha on time. The connecting flight was almost 3 hrs late due to late incomming aircraft. A Boeing 787, narrow seats, (entertainment box under some seats, plugs for headphones hidden in armrest). Same bad food for me, and very nice crew.  Return flights were similar aircraft types with the same topics. I found the constant noise from the on/off signals for seat belts on a night flight quite annoying. After a few repetitions no one paid attention, since there were no turbulence to mention.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-06;" |  Doha to Alexandria. It was amazing flight, the cabin crew was so nice and the food good. The seat was comfortable and the airport facilities in Doha was awesome for me. The best airline, a good ticket price and excellent service and entertainment.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-05;" |  Travelled Qatar Airways from Copenhagen - Doha - Kuala Lumpur on 4th and 5th March 2017. Flights on time. Excellent trips and service top notch. It can hardly get better in economy. Staff caring, respectful, trying to pamper me at great lengths. Check-in cooperative and discussed opportunities for upgrade which I eventually could not as my ticket was extremely much discounted (purchased through global sale). Lounge used in CPH is the Aspire, which is rubbish but QR are now negotiating with the new Lounge “Adventure” to change which could be a big boost. I was acknowledged as Platinum card holder on board and got extremely good attendance throughout. They prepared a special starter for me with rice-salad and cheese and wine. Drinks ad libitum, now only 1 white and 1 red wine available and no champagne. These 2 wines were – to my taste – extremely good. The white wine was South African produced from Pinot Gris grapes with an extremely rich taste. Were given 2 hot meals on both legs. They were all different, tasty, and good. The fact portions were small was outweighed by generous additions when requested. Flights not full and I could sleep stretched out on 3 seats on each leg. Flights only 500 USD (return ticket).";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-03-03;" |  Bangkok to Copenhagen via Doha on 1st/2nd March 2017. Flights on time. Check-in a pleasure. FAs on top of things and one gets pampered with a good focus on each passengers despite business class were full on both flights. Food and drinks kept good standards though have slipped a little bit. Wines onboard are excellent, however, their beers are lousy, extremely boring, and all alike – seems to be a sad trademark of QR. Dine on demand seems to have caused smaller portions without proper stable food (other than accompanying bread). FAs on the last sector (to CPH) were much less professional and uncertain on how to please passengers as compared to FAs on the BKK-DOH sector. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha is very good. Very cheap ticket purchased during their ”global sale” in May 2016, almost a year earlier. Miles were very generous due to unexpected, additional promotions (that I randomly ran in to as they were not there when ticket was purchased) and instantly credited to my account. My Priv. Club card was instantly upgraded to Platinum even before landing in Copenhagen. This I would call for a pleasant and soft landing. IFE good, amenity kit replaced by new brand, lovely. I got pyjamas on night sectors. Bar on A380 was lively, likely due to fully loaded cabins. Headphones good. Qatar Airways delivers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-28;" |  Denpasar to London Heathrow via Doha. The seats on this aircraft were very comfortable and the staff were second to none. I flew on an A380 and a Boeing 777-300ER, the leg room is better than other airlines in economy. The staff could not have done enough, on my flight from DOH to DPS I was sat in the middle with 4 other men, broad shoulders, so they upgraded me to business! I will be flying this airline again long haul as I think they are one of the best carriers out there in terms of leg room and routes. My only complaint would be that the meals are rather small, so you might be hungry during the flight. I only paid £350 for my flight from London to Bali return so exceptional value too.";POSITIVE

Doha to Lahore A330 far from new. Flight full, seats less comfortable, breakfast served was edible but not outstanding. A320 from Islamabad to Doha upgraded to business class as connection time was tight and plane was full. Full meal served and what a difference both in cabin crew attitude and food quality which was excellent. Doha to London, A350 rushed to make connection and no aircraft at the stand. Flight delayed by 2.5 hours but no reason given. A350 with hard seats but wider and more leg room. Plane was modern and flight quieter than with 777. Meal served was average. Apology for delay from Captain on landing at Heathrow 2.5 hours late. IFE was good throughout.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-28; |  Dubai to Manila return via Dubai.  Both flights on time. Decided to change my seat to exit row 25H and was assisted upon arriving in Doha through their transfer desk. Staffs are helpful in Hamad airport. While on board everything is ok. Meals are fine. Returning check in was smooth at Manila. Terminal 1 of MNL is not as chaotic as before. Departed and arrived on time in both sectors. Cabin crews are more helpful and professional compared to the previous flight. Inflight meals are better also maybe because it depends on the catering providers on each destination. Overall it was a wonderful flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-27;" |  London to Singapore via Doha was a disappointing journey. A380 is great. so quiet and nice onboard lounge. Qatar Airways catering is usually very good, but QR10 departing London at 0900 offered a (poor) breakfast service and that was it! On the DOH-SIN sector I skipped dinner to try to sleep on this 7 hour overnight flight, but I couldn't wear the far too large sleeper suit and the cabin temperature was too high, so I sweated and got dehydrated. Cabin air was as dry as older aircraft, so I left the flight feeling rough. Not like Boeing 787, and not how A350 should be. My partner got a nosebleed because of dry cabin air. I was heading for Malaysia but chose Singapore over KL purely for the A350, which proved to be a mistake. A350 is not as quiet as A380, but the seat is the same. Transit in Doha was badly managed with no staff to guide transfer passengers to correct route.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-20;" |  Krabi to Munich via Doha. The meal is only average. Sometimes they offered a menu list with options but on other long-haul flights they didn’t seem to. They did not distinguish between their vegan, vegetarian, low-carb, no-milk meals and have one low-calories meal for all meatless options. So while others get a cake, you get fruits, when others get a yoghurt, you get a low-fat yoghurt. There is also an inflight entertainment box under the window seats, which makes the flight uncomfortable. If you are flying the old A330, there is no USB connection and we could not charge our mobile phones. The A330 IFE did not have touchscreen control and headphones were of poor quality. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-19;" |  We had a flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha in business class. We fly freqently with Qatar Airways and are silver member. We started the first flight with a Boeing 777, a plane we like. Everything was okay, the food was excellent as were the wines, and the staff is very kind! Also stop in Doha was a pleasant experience. We visit it a couple off times but stil amazing lounge. The next flight Doha to Bangkok with the A380 that's different, the business class is so big, We fly 3 times with a A380 but everytime we try a different seat but is so crouwded so chaotic with the staff. Don't get me wrong,the food is very good, staff is friendly, but there are to many guests, they can't give good service! For the rest it's good value for your money. We will fly Qatar Airways anyway.

qatar-airways;2017-02-16;" |  Flew Doha to Johannesburg. Qatar has one of the best business class products. 6 seats across on the B777 seem to be tight, but even if you have a window seat, you do not have to step over your neighbor as there is so much space between the rows. As always, the catering out of Doha is exceptional, and the wine list leaves nothing to be desired. The crew were excellent, and I really like that you can eat when you want, and whatever you want on the menu at anytime. The pyjamas were the last touch that made this night flight great. I cannot wait to try the A350 as the guy next to me told me that they are the ultimate plane in business class on the Qatar Airways fleet. Also, if you are flexible, the Qatar business class fares can be a bargain compared to other airlines.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-16;" |  Doha to Auckland. Having flown 7hrs with Qatar from Edinburgh to Doha with a quick change to this 16hr 30 minute flight I was concerned that it would feel very uncomfortable being on such a long flight. I'm happy to say It was not. You just relax into it, especially in business class. This is a wide bodied aircraft which felt quite spacious in business having 6 seats to the row and a large personal tv screen for all the movies. The food was fantastic - having had a beef meal on the previous flight, I chose a Nobu lightly spicy broth with seafood followed by a fabulous red snapper, saffron cream and asparagus and the wines worthy of this airline which was deservedly voted having the best wine cellar in the sky. (Ch. Brane Cantanac red, fine Chablis and Babich Sauvignon from Marlborough NZ). Best of all was the flexibility about when to eat and being such a long flight, there was a constant supply of bottled water, cups of tea and snacks. The seating arrangement works well with easy access to the aisles although a little more storage space for the things we want beside us on a long haul flight would have been more helpful. The cabin crew were charming and no request was too much trouble. I would have no hesitation in flying this longest scheduled flight route in the world again. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-15; |  Adelaide to Oslo via Doha. Had the pleasure to fly again with Qatar Airways. The service in business class is far superior to any other airline I have flown. Call bells was attended to promptly. Food is well prepared and delicious. Decent selection of wine and spirits. Seats very comfortable and they provide pajamas on the long haul sectors. Good amenity kit. Lounge in Doha excellent. Well worth their 5 star rating.;POSITIVE

I hope it will stay like this.";POSITIVE

This was a mixed Business/Economy fare (which was really good value) with Sydney to Doha in Business and Economy onwards to Vienna and the same back to Doha from London. I unwittingly got to travel in all three classes and can only say positive things about this airline. Business Class from Sydney to Doha was great really nice cabin and seat, well thought out with loads of storage space. The wine selection was also outstanding (I am a wine buff), food a bit more average. A really good flight and the lounge in Doha is excellent, if a little hard to find. Business felt like a real 'treat' and was a really nice way to start a holiday. Economy to and from Europe was decent enough - but especially coming back in the A380. Try and get a seat upstairs at the back of Business - small cabin with it's own toilets and only about 8-10 rows. I managed to score the front row so had heaps of leg room. From Doha back to Sydney they upgraded me to First from Business - what a treat! The Krug and caviar went down a treat and every aspect of the flight was excellent. I was really impressed by Qatar Airways and feel it is superior to both Qantas and Emirates.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-13;" |  Medina to Istanbul via Doha. Our flight was overbooked from Medina when we got to the airport. We were told that only 3 of the 6 passengers could board the flight. We had a layover in Doha for a day so the connection time wasn't an issue. The check in staff told us that we came late to check in but then we argued that it doesn't mean that you can check in 3 passengers and can't check in the other 3 as we all came at the same time. Then they told us the truth that the flight was overbooked after 20 minutes and they said the next 3 flights are fully booked. So 3 of the passengers boarded the flight and the other 3 including me stayed at Madina airport. The Qatar airways manager was very calm and helpful. He put us on the next flight which was in 4 hours, gave us free lounge access and gave us compensation more that what we bought the ticket for. The flight from Medina to Doha was pleasant, food was nice, atmosphere was calm, and there was good in flight entertainment. The second flight to Istanbul was even better with more of a choice of food, inflight entertainment, and WiFi onboard which was working well. Overall the service by the cabin crew was brilliant and I would definitely recommend Qatar airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-12;" |  Bangkok to Doha, 09 Feb 2017, Economy Class seat 026D Airbus A380. Flight attendants and staff are excellent and genuine. Onboard the A380 you have a comfortable seat with satisfactory legroom (32 inches) and generous width (18,5 inches). Frequent flyers are seated on the upper desk, and usually may be assigned their favorite seat number, if they ask for it. Overall, flying the A380 with QR is an excellent experience. We just hope that Qatar Airways will keep their generous seat width (18,5) on the A380, and will not shift to a 17 width seat, as on their B777 (10 seats abreast). ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-11;" |  Madrid to Taif via Doha. I normally fly this airline if they have the route. I will overfly my destination and give myself a layover in Doha because they are were so good. I arrived with my 11 year old son very early for check in Madrid. So much so they were still checking in the early flight to Doha. QR 150 not 152. But they checked me in early superb service from the check in staff. A male boarding supervisor came and destroyed 8 years of perfect customer satisfaction in a few minutes. He informed me that I was welcome to use the silver lounge pass but my 11 year old son (minor) was not. This cost was incurred by Qatar Airways and despite he being registered as a minor family member he would not be able to use the facilities in Madrid as they cost Qatar Airways too much money and they had to pay for this service. A family member and a minor. He then confidently called the previous female supervisor who Qatar Airways should be very proud to have a an employee for her courteous and professional demeanor and manner who promptly over-ruled his decision and issued my 11 year old (minor) accompanying passenger to sit with his only accompanying passenger in the Iberia VIP lounge in terminal 4s. Having flown no airline but Qatar Airways for the last 7-8 years occasionally overflying my destination and having long layovers in one of the nicest airports in the world this will no longer be the case as matter of course. There are choices. When I become a burden of inconvenience for my loyalty as a customer then something happened to the overall picture. The flight was OK. Night flight nothing special other than the fasten seat belts sign was illuminated for the duration of the meal service and collection of trays, with no Turbulence.  I look forward to returning to the best standards achievable in my next flight. The numerical assessment reflects my belief this was a one off by people / individuals having a bad day and professional people rectifying the issues after much deliberation. Hence still recommended. Doha to Taif was perfect as always. Except having bought a Qatar Airways ticket found myself on an Al Maha badged aircraft (internally) with no IFE. The staff are to be commended for this leg!";NEGATIVE

Need to modernize and refurbish these no IFE on any flight nowadays is really not acceptable especially for an airline of this standard. Other than that very nice flight with attentive flight crews good food and good service. 10 hour wait in Doha. Hotel entitlement is not automatic even though when booking they say they will accommodate. So we saw our co-passenger off and spent an extremely pleasant and long wait in Hamad airport. Access to the Oneworld / Silver lounge. This is not the Business class lounge used by Qatar business ticketed passengers. Nevertheless very pleasant stay, well staffed and good food. Sleeping room was great were we spent most of our time in between eating. The flight on the Boeing 787 from Doha to Madrid was excellent. Very food IFE. Nice flight, good connectivity. Attentive crew the usual perfect Qatar Airways attention to detail. Well done to everyone for another memorable flight. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-11;" |  Copenhagen to Bangkok via Doha. My last flight our prebooked seats were given to other passengers. This was solved after long discussion at the airport check in. Then our Priority tags on our suitcases were removed somewhere between check in and loading to aircraft. So we had to wait nearly an entire A380 flight baggage to be delivered before getting our so called Priority bags. Our connecting flight from DOH to BKK was delayed about 6 hours, so we spent the night at DOH airport. They started out with a 3 hour delay, and later when the first 3 hours was nearly elapsed the delay was changed to 6 hours. Qatar Airways has a rule to give hotel accommodation if the delays is 6 hours or more, but of course we did not get this. It was a disaster trip.";NEGATIVE

I only learned about it the day before, and consequently had to rebook my connecting flights at my destination with a penalty of €150. Then as if that wasn't enough the flight left almost 2 hours late and I missed my connecting flight in Doha, and had to stay 18 hours for the next flight. I arrived at my final destination 24 hours later. I contacted the customer service and explained my case, but they not want to reimburse my rebooking fee. ";NEGATIVE

No voucher was given, not even water, and I arrived with a delay of 3 hours in Singapore. I thought the meals on board were horrible. The distance between the seats was horrible.

But overall a very pleasant flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-02-03;" |  Philadelphia to Denpasar Bali via Doha. Before choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali, I studied many, many reviews of a number of different airlines which led to my choosing Qatar Airways for our flight to Bali. I booked these tickets myself online, so was a bit anxious about any hitches that might occur, since this was the first time for both a flight of this magnitude and my unfamiliarity with this airline. I am so very happy I chose them because of the many flights I have taken, both inside the US and internationally, Qatar Airways currently has my vote as the best - for service, for seating and for overall efficiency and pleasant travel. Check-in, both in the US and in Bali was exceptional: Fast, efficient and friendly. I am mobility-impaired, and need a wheelchair for distances in the airport. I cannot stress the exceptional quality of care that was given to me, from the point of entry into the Qatar area. Not only in terms of fast, friendly transport through check-in, customs, security and onto the planes, but once I was entered into their system as mobility-impaired at the first airport, we were upgraded to more comfortable seating: very helpful. Service on the planes was impeccable. Staff was friendly, attentive (note, these were almost 13 and 10 hour flights, so staff were on for long hours) to requests and periodically checked, even if no requests were made. I pre-ordered meals (not necessary, I discovered unless you really do want special meals) and was able to change the request while in-flight. Meals, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, were tasty (on the way out particularly, featured a lot of protein), were plentiful and beautifully served. Since when on US flights do we get served with real silverware?  Plenty of individual entertainment options. a nice seat pack that included eyeshades, ear plugs,and other goodies. good blanket. good earphones, etc. Kids get special treatment with extra goodies - and maybe as a result (or else we had exceptional parents, babies and children both ways), little crying or loud kiddie noises during these long, exhausting flights). I could go on and on, but suffice it to say, I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again, and am recommending it to people I know as an excellent option. I have no clue as to what happens in business and first class, but I would say have no qualms about booking economy seats on Qatar Airways. One additional thing: Next time, I intend to make a stopover in Doha, especially on the way back, because flying to Southeast Asia seemed easier than the return, maybe due to time differences, we had actually been awake much longer. But also because Doha looks fascinating. I will at the least plan a longer layover, because from the airport, on can actually get 3 or 5 hour city tours. There is an airport hotel, but it is also easy to arrange to stay over for a day or two. Just check it out.";POSITIVE

I was a frequent flyer with Etihad Airways (which disappointed me a lot during the last years) but decided to give a try to Qatar Airways.  The big plus of Qatar Airways is crews members and attention to the details. You feel they try the max in order to make this experience enjoyable even while flying economy. Fast check-in, easy transfer, many ground staff available at Hamad airport for assistance, comfortable and new aircraft, tasty food served in a generous quantity, great entertainment system. Incredible experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-28;" |  Paris CDG to Doha. Qatar Airways is such a nice airline to fly with. From the check in experience until the arrival is amazing, however it has a few flaws. From the check in, they checked me all the way to Kuala Lumpur, everything went nice and smooth. I am Indonesian living in Jakarta so ground staff asked me that if I do have the ticket to Jakarta or not and I explained I want to spend time in Kuala Lumpur and have the ticket to CGK. Here's a little tip, I recommend that you guys should check-in via web since Qatar Airways provided a faster lane for web check-in users, however they still print the boarding pass so it's no need to print on your own, you just only have to complete your personal info. Hence after check-in, I directly headed to the boarding gate, it has no problem and everything went smooth. Boarding to the aircraft, I was greeted by the warmf flight attendants. Our seat located on the front was shown by the FA. My sister wanted to take a pic with the FA and she is very nice and friendly to her. Before departure, my sister which is 10 yo was given a colorful monopoly bag with board games for entertainment. However after 10 minutes taxiing, the aircraft was going back to the gate due to some trouble (which wasn't told to the passenger) and we had a delay of an hour, so that they gave us free water or juice. After 1.5 hours taxiing, we finally leave Paris. Inside the A380, the seat is quite different with the A340s and 777s of Qatar, it has the neck rest. It is actually quite good for me, a person taller than 5'7"", however it could be a disaster for a person with lower height. The cabin crew handed out dinner.  The meal was pretty awesome and had a rich taste (keep in mind that arabian food has lots of spices in their food which is great). Another thing is that I can actually fill a water bottle to make me keep hydrated even when i remain seated so that i do not need to call the fa for some drinks. After the meal, I discover the in-flight entertainment and it was pretty cool. The screen was big and it was very responsive (in comparasion to the 777s of Qatar's). It also have the mini PDA-like remote which is very responsive. Qatar Airways offer new movies, and I watched 2 new movies during this sector. However, the A380s doesn't seem to have wider collections rather than the 777s. During the flight, free wi-fi for economy passengers is offered for a limit (15 minutes, 10MB). The internet connection was horrible however I manage to chat with a few people though. 2 hours prior to landing, served a snack and coffee. Also during the hours we suffer some turbulences but the cabin crew manage to handle professionally. What I like during the flight is that I feel the A380s are very quiet in comparason to the 777s so that we could rest. Overall, it was an awesome flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-27;" |  Doha to London Heathrow, economy class on B787. Having flown the A380 on my outbound flight, this aircraft felt a little cramped particularly for seat width. We hit the jackpot with cabin staff on this flight, those in our section of the plane were Filipino and simply wonderful. They were really cheerful to customers throughout the flight, efficient bar and meal service, and most importantly they kept coming around the cabin after lights out to check on customer needs. Food was okay, nothing more, but the rest was excellent - particularly the inflight entertainment.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-24;" |  Frankfurt to Cape Town via Doha. I normally use Etihad or Turkish from Frankfurt to South Africa. First time Qatar Airways Business Class and very happy with it. On the shorter leg Frankfurt-Doha they use their youngest fleet of Boeing 787 and A350, both equipped with the most spacious and luxurious seats I have ever sat in. Lots of legroom, lots of room to stow away your belongings. Even pajamas in Business class during night flights. Only flaws were the restricted and slow WiFi on board, a very small menu on their night service Doha to Frankfurt with little choice and the lack of a chauffeur service for Business guests. Etihad and Emirates offer this service. Hamad Airport and Qatar Airways lounge facilities at Doha airport are of a breathtaking quality, just splendid. The Cape Town service is flown with Boeing 777-300. Less comfortable, no WiFi, but still competitive for a 5 star airline. The friendliness and attentiveness of all the crew members during all 4 flights was close to perfection. Will definitely fly them again.";POSITIVE

The food is very good, great in flight movies, comfortable seats and friendly cabin crew. One particular cabin crew member was extremely helpful, courteous and very polite during the flight. He provided first class service and it makes such a difference to be made welcome and comfortable especially when travelling on a lengthy journey. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-20; |  London Heathrow to Colombo via Doha. The flight from London to Doha was on an A380-800 and was flawless. In spite of freezing weather at LHR we took off only 30mins late and after de-icing. The cabin crew were great and the meals were good. The seat configuration was 3x4x3. We got to Doha on time with enough time for transit. My next flight from DOH to CMB was on a A330 with 2-4-2 seating and which felt rather claustrophobic after the A350-800. Cabin service was not as good as on the LHR-DOH sector.;POSITIVE

The service at the Doha airport during a delay was terrible, when our flight suffered a 7 hours delay in Doha (initially a 2 hours delay) and we were given a couple of meal vouchers. To get the vouchers we had to ask several people from the Qatar staff (the staff at the lounge desk wasn't able to give any information, so we had to return the transfer desk). Phone support was unavailable : I called the hotline and remained waiting for 20 minutes before I hung up. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-15;" |  Manchester to Singapore via Doha. Flight from Doha to Singapore delayed by almost 3 hours as we arrived in Doha. I had to ask the transfer counter as my onward journey from Singapore will be affected. One agent at the transfer counter listened to me and calmly suggested another flight to my final destination. She changed my second flight and I finally got to my final destination yesterday, although 2 hours later. I would like to thank her for listening calmly and then to offer a different flight. She is a true gem indeed and this reflects well on Qatar Airways. Unlike other transfer staff who didn't listen and just gave us a meal voucher without explaining or listening to the customers. Thanks to her professionalism, this review is getting a decent rating although my second flight was delayed. If only all staff can treat customer as professional and courteous as she did, despite delays and disgruntled customers, Qatar Airways will continue to do well.";POSITIVE

Full services with onboard entertainment, meals and drinks. Modern planes, Boeing 787 on many routes, pleasant seating. However, connections at Doha can be a cardio exercise if connecting gates are located at opposite ends of airport - the shuttle train since3 opened in January 2017.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-14;" |  This is my second time flying with Qatar Airways since 2015. The trip from Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha was great, I received my preferred seat, which was the very rear seat. The seats are rather comfortable despite it was almost full for the first half of the journey, the foods they serve are tasty and rather fine for the economy class. Entertainment system worked fine and the programs were updated. The cabin crew responded anything I needed very quick and even though I did not sleep (I can't sleep on plane, ever) the whole journey was rather comfortable and I arrive London with a positive happy mood. I guess the only downfall is the wifi connection are not working all the journey.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-13;" |  Edinburgh to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. First leg Edinburgh - Doha the plane is on time, and it also have huge space for me to put my hand luggage on the bottom seat instead of overhead compartments, the food was nice as expected with entertainment system working just fine, seat is very comfortable. And the only let down is the Wifi and connection to the iPod to the Oryx system is not working. Second leg (Doha - Kuala Lumpur)  I was upgraded to the business class for whatever reason it is (I am not complain). And is my second time in business class, the seat are very comfortable and with the flexibility of meals they provide all were 5 stars quality. You can adjust the seats in the position most comfortable at. I was treat well during the whole journey and leave the plane happily with just minor issues.  The place to plug in the earphone and store your belongings (phone, wallet etc) were rather awkward just below and beside the handrest, is bit difficult to plug it or store it. I try to turn the seat into bed position and it was not that comfortable as it is hard. At the end of the day I wish the plane arrive ""a lot later"" as I didn't want my experience in business class end, so I guess that summed how good is the flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-12;" |  My husband and I were flying from Moscow to Bali via Doha. The first segment was okay, but during Doha to Denpasar after 20 minutes of flying we found it is really cold in the cabin. We told the cabin crew about this but it wasn't ok even after two hours. We and the rest of the passengers put on all winter clothing we had and asked the cabin crew to make it warmer at least a little bit. It took five hours of asking to make it warmer in the cabin. I think the cabin crew just did not understand what we were talking about as the galley areas were warmer. They give you a brunch menu but our choice was finished by the time they get to us. I think catering professionals should know how to make all the items in the menu last for all clients. On the positive side the cabin crew were very nice and polite.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-08;" | Melbourne to Casablanca via Doha, returning from Barcelona. Very good business class product by Qatar Airways. Boeing 777 from Melbourne offers a very comfortable space. Slept well on both legs, as the cabin was slightly cooler making it comfortable (even through lots of turbulence DOH to MEL). Flight attendants were very attentive on all legs, although they were not quite ready to greet customers on the DOH to MEL flight, but quickly made up for it once on board and seated. Flew on the Dreamliner from Doha to Casablanca and I found it very stuffy. The seating arrangement was ok, but lacked the space of the Boeing 777. Barcelona to Doha, I sat next to a employee of Qatar (I believe a senior member) who was very well cared for by the attendants which as a paying customer was interesting to observe this attentiveness. He is very proud of Qatar Airways and their product which is good to hear the other side. I will be flying with them again in late August and look forward to the experience in the A380.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-07;" |  This trip has been a mixed bag with the outbound flight from Adelaide to Oslo via Doha being essentially good and without incident. However the return trip open jaw from Barcelona after a cruise was a different matter. The onboard experience on the flight from Barcelona to Doha was good and our hostess for our section of the plane was outstanding, but ground staff at Barcelona left a lot to be desired particularly for business passengers. We arrived before the check in start time and had to wait for staff to arrive and set themselves up. After the check in staff arrived they played with their computers, talked amongst themselves and had a meeting without providing any explanation to waiting of passengers who were left waiting for 30 minutes. When we finally checked in our bags they were tagged as ""long transfer"" routing them direct to Adelaide without any explanation been given of the implications. When we arrived in the early hours of the morning in Doha were we advised by the transfer desk that we could not have access to our checked luggage. Hence we were left without spare clothing, toiletries and essential medications for our less than 24 hour stopover. It was by chance that we had some essential items in our cabin luggage. The transfer desk operative attitude to our predicament was most uncustomer friendly. We believe that Qatar should have informed us of the requirement to pack the items we required for the stopover in our cabin bags when they advised that our booked flight had been changed neccessitating the stop over. The Oryx airline hotel was good but as business passengers we felt that a private car would have been more appropropriate than waiting for a minibus to take us to the hotel. The customer service at the Doha airport for business class passengers is inconsistent with the service around the check in area verging on overkill while after passengers have been processed they are left to wander around the airport in search of the business lounge. Doha to Adelaide was mixed with some cabin staff providing excellent service while others were lazy. I was not offered a mattress or breakfast while my wife on the other aisle received excellent service. I experienced extreme difficulty in having our flights credited to our respective frequent flyer accounts, (which I believe should be automatically recorded when making the booking as the FF codes are shown on our boarding passes). I have sent two emails via the Qatar frequent flyer webpage which have been ignored. Customer service in Australia appears to be non existent! All in all, our experience with Qatar has been disappointing.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2017-01-04;" |  I travelled CPH-DOH-BKK on 1st and 2nd January 2017 - on B788 and B77W, respectively. Check-in counter in CPH puzzled me as QR now start to disallow checking in luggage further than the first tickets end-destination. That is a huge downfall as in this case I will have to check in my luggage again in Bangkok – this, despite that my next carrier is their Oneworld alliance member, Malaysia Airlines. That cost me an hour and a half extra struggle in BKK due to cease of this baggage further transfer service – this is an unacceptable change and huge deterioration of service - likely inspired by BA who recently stopped offering further luggage transfers. All flights on time. Poor lounge offered in CPH, a third party lounge called Aspire – likely the most boring lounge in the world. Pre-departure drinks in CPH offered but with soft drinks only. When QR departs from any other Scandinavian Airport like OSL, HEL, or ARN they offer full drink service predeparture – why can’t they do it in CPH? Menu had no seafood, fish, or lamb. Icecream offered but they ran out of stock before they reached my seat 4A, despite having initially ordered. No smoothies. Cheeseplate available. Good wines and spirits. 3 beers offered, provide no alternative as they are almost identical and dull in taste (Corona, Heineken, and Foster). FAs did a great job. Lounge in Doha excellent. Second flight DOH-BKK with equipment change due to poor load factor to mobilise the A380 and was changed to an older B777-300ER without 1st class and bar. Pre-departure drinks included champagne. The seats could not go horizontal, only some 165 degrees angle – but were fully flat. Food and drink service excellent and pyjamas and kits were given out. Nice, light breakfast given out close to landing – here I got my beloved smoothie.";POSITIVE

But this is balanced by a very good inflight entertainment system, and power plugs to refill your phones, tablets, ereader batteries.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-12-31;" |  Oslo to Bangkok via Doha. The boarding in Oslo was a bit chaotic. The crew welcomed me with a glass of champagne and warm nuts. I was impressed by the amazing cabin of the Boeing 787. After take-off the crew took my orders and service was one of the quickest, unfortunately my meal option went out. But not too bad I then went with the Arabic chicken for main which was amazing, as a starter I chose salmon along with potato salad and for dessert they offered ice cream. The crew was amazing and friendly. They often came and brought chocolate, cookies and drinks. The only thing I wish is free Wi-Fi for Business passengers and for their Elites. Because you pay a lot money and with Wi-Fi you could answer mails or just simply browse the web. The transfer at their Doha hub was quick and well organized. But the line for Business passengers was a bit too full. After that I went to their amazing lounge. The second flight was not as good as the first one. It was departing in the morning and arriving in the evening. They only had breakfast option and no lunch or dinner options. But at least the catered option tasted amazing and were top. The seats on the Boeing 777 fleet are a bit old and when compared to their Boeing 787, A380 and A350. Overall, Qatar Airways is the best airline in Business class service.";POSITIVE

The flight crew was excellent and very attentive to customer needs. The in-flight entertainment system was one of the best, if not the best, that I have encountered with enough entertainment to keep you occupied for a long flight and the touchscreen display worked without any flaws. The food was excellent although I found the presentation of the food to be a bit confusing (perhaps it was just me). The seats were comfortable, and the seat pitch was more than adequate. The overall experience was great, and Qatar Airways lived up to the hype. I would recommend Qatar Airways to anyone.";POSITIVE

No real complaints about the planes or cabin crew. Entertainment good, good leg room (although I'm only 1.7m). Slimline seats on Boeing 777 actually more comfortable than more traditional seats on the A380 although it seemed like a newer plane. Not too many announcements apart from at beginning and end of flight which is good compared to some carriers constantly trying to sell duty free etc. Main complaint would be the food and drink service. The food was just OK and they are very stingy with alcoholic drinks. They had the small wine bottles (187.5ml) but poured them in to a glass and saved the remaining 50mls or so for the next passenger, this seemed very like cost cutting at its most obvious. Overall, a good value pleasant experience but meal and drink service needs improvement.";POSITIVE

Short flight, 40 minutes effectively but I got it all. First time I have seen staff serving pre-departure water pre-departure.

qatar-airways;2016-12-06;"Delhi to Edinburgh via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways as I was very curious about the Dreamliner that Boeing and many people were talking about. I wanted to feel for myself the spacious layout, the more natural cabin pressure closer to the ground, and the larger colour-changing windows. When I boarded the aircraft, there was a little lounge between the business and the economy classes, so it did feel very spacious. The design of the over-head luggage compartments also made it feel more spacious than other aircraft when you standing in the aisle. Were the windows larger? I was not sure - maybe, as I could see the ground from my aisle seat. There was definitely a difference in the cabin pressure - during taking-off and landing, I did not feel any pain in my ears. The leg room was not tight, but somehow I did not feel it was as comfortable as I was imagining. I just felt lack of support on my back and my feet never feel too relaxed. Also, there was a box under the front seat in all A and C seats (I guess it is the same for the other side, too), taking up quite a lot of space. In terms of the service, it was pretty good. One of my stereo earphone jacks in 19H did not work, so the flight attendants changed me to 20D. The food was OK, but far from amazing. I really enjoyed the omelette and chicken sausage on Flight 579 from Delhi to Doha - the omelette, the sausage and the mushrooms were tender, succulent and full of flavours, but the same dish on QR29 from Doha to Edinburgh was oddly very dry, tough and obviously overcooked. The in-flight entertainment was good - there were 35 new movies to choose from, on top of other older movies. They claimed to offer WiFi on board, but I could not connect to it, or even when I was connected, it was not usable (not even to browse the web). There was phone signal on the plane, though, but I did not try to send a text. Personally, I would rate this journey above average, but I did not think it reached my expectation.";POSITIVE

Very well trained and polite crew, very good cuisine on board, nice wine selection although the choices of champagnes have declined in quality. Two years ago I was able to drink Pol Roger Rosé Vintage 2006 and now it is Lanson Rosé. Same changes in the variety of food and drinks in the Biz lounge in Doha. Never been my favorite, due to its immense size, it feels more like a train station than a lounge. Another change is the frequency of time changes with Qatar now: My first leg of this trip was changed 4 times back and forward, last time about two weeks before departure date. Inconvenient, because I had a meeting before in Stockholm and had to change my agenda and that of others several times as well. This is not the way you can do business. As a summary still very nice business class product, but losing the advantage to competitors.";POSITIVE

Running through the terminal, I passed QR checkin already with my boarding pass and let them know I had landed. They told me to proceed through security and phoned the gate to let them know to expect me. At the gate I was greeted by cheers from the staff who radioed to confirm that my bag had also made it. Onboard Qatar Airways have an economy product to be proud of. Spacious seating, nice fitting and legroom, very good food (I opted for chicken both for lunch and dinner), good whisky, drinks runs throught the flight, all the latest movies, lovely staff, smooth transit at DOH, generous luggage, miles credited from other one world partners - well done, you have set the bar very high.";POSITIVE

The overall experience was low stress and helped me manage my anxiety which was incredibly important given that I have a severe fear of flying. Being able to go through the much shorter Business class TSA line, being able to decompress in the lounge prior to boarding and having priority boarding made the lead up to the actual flight a positive one. Onboard the plane, the staff were friendly and service was top notch. Seats were comfortable with plenty of room to stretch out, get up and walk around. Noise cancellation headphones helped drown out the engine and ambient noise which helped my mental state. The PJs and amenity kit were great, providing great comfort and warmth. The overall inflight cabin experience was really great, hats off to really good cabin crews Qatar Airways. Arrival and lay-over at Hamad International Airport was smooth, efficient, and comfortable. I love the Al Mourjan business lounge. Being able to take a shower and decompress from the stress of flying in such a lovely and spacious environment before continuing on my journey was a necessity I didn't realize I needed. Love the shower rooms and the food in either restaurant (there are two in the lounge) was great. Having separate areas was smart and the quiet area is fantastic for catching up on some sleep between flights. Didn't do any shopping at Hamad but they looked like they had quite a lot to offer. The second leg of my journey also went smoothly. Upon arrival being ahead of the main rush was good and my bags were off the belt within the first 10 that arrived. Business class tickets aren't cheap but for the level of service, the quality of the product and the amenities that you get with Qatar Airways, it was money well spent and an experience I will happily pay for again in the future.";POSITIVE

Flew on the Boeing 787 from Manchester to Doha return, an excellent aircraft, plenty of space, good IFE, Crew on both outward and inward journey excellent, food very good, although did not eat on return journey due to not feeling well (slept for 6hrs). I wish Qatar would do away with the narrow bodied A321 on the Doha to Goa leg of the journey - very cramped, economy passengers putting their luggage in lockers above business and on the return journey a screaming/crying child for the whole flight with only a curtain seperating economy from business - the only reason i am not giving 10 out of 10. Crew on all flights were excellent. Lounge in Doha excellent - the best lounge I have been in, the Escape lounge they use in Manchester just about ok, lounge in Goa, well it's just laughable - 1 drink & then either a burger (on it's own no fries) or a mini cheese and tomato  pizza. Will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.";POSITIVE

Nice business class seat that makes into a nice bed for sleep. The meal served was quite good, but staff service was slow during meal times and forgot wine order twice. IFE with a great choice of films and TV to watch. Transfer in Doha was okay both ways - a slight wait at security screening, and then into lounge. The lounge is visually nice, but the amenities were all overcrowded - couldn't wait for a shower due to the queues and food choice a bit uninspiring. For the price paid, the trip was exceptional value, and apart from some slow staff service, the rest of the product was great. Will use again.";POSITIVE

Before take-off they asked me if I'd flown with Qatar Airways before which I hadn't so they then took the time to explain how the on-board service works, (you can order whatever you want from the menu to be served at any time you like). I got some sleep on the overnight sector to Doha and was impressed by the experience, I wasn't as impressed with the A330 that operates the Doha to Phuket sectors, I'm of average build but I found the seat to be very narrow when in bed mode and couldn't sleep. Food and beverage immaculately presented and of a high standard, entertainment system easy to use and good content. Final sector Doha to Heathrow upper deck on the A380, single seat, configuration 1-2-1 really comfortable seat/bed with plenty of personal storage space. I'm not sure why Qatar Airways bother with the bar at the back of the business class cabin on this aircraft as I only saw one person using it. The lounge at Doha is okay but didn't blow me away as expected from reading various reviews, it was very busy both times I was there and I found it to be quite soulless and uninteresting. Also the dining options were limited, not my favourite airline lounge. Overall though a very solid business class product, I won't hesitate to fly with Qatar Airways again.";POSITIVE

The fully-flat seat allowed me to take a sound sleep, which was needed given the late night schedule of the both the incoming and outgoing flights - hence no movie watching. Smooth flight.

A terrible experience with the A330-200, which Qatar Airways replaced recently for this route. Seat is narrow and cramped and so is the cabin with it's 2x2x2 configuration, crew had no decent space to serve customers without touching others. No storage room in or around the seat, no decent storage place for the provided bottle of water. Food poor. Crew attentive and trying to make the best of things. Real shame Qatar Airways uses this plane on long haul flights. Flight from Doha to Brussels onboard the Dreamliner was such a relief and a wonderful experience again. Seat, dining and service top notch. Truly a 5 star business class product. If they can replace all the A330's on long haul by 787, A350 or A380 then overall would be 10 points. ";NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2016-11-17;" |  Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. I can't think of any other airlines that match the standards of Qatar Airways. Excellent check-in facilities at Manchester, Qatar don't have their own lounge here and use the Escape lounge which isn't the best as now they've merged the business class and normal lounge so it's crowded and noisy but very helpful staff. Since I originally booked, Qatar changed the transit time in Doha and the aircraft on both legs of the journey, Manchester to Doha is now a Boeing 787, an improvement on the A330, but Doha to Bangkok is now a Boeing 777 which isn't up to the standard of the A380. However once onboard it's the service that matters not the aircraft, and this is where Qatar excels. The flight attendants are helpful and attentive,  the food is probably the best you'll get on a flight, the entertainment is good with a choice of movies to suit most tastes. The 787 is a fine aircraft however I found the seats in business slightly uncomfortable probably due to being 6'5"" as the end of the seat was halfway down the back of my thighs and I needed to recline the seat. The 777 feels old now compared to the 787 and A380, the business cabin seems cramped due to the 2x2x2 layout. All flights arrived early despite one being delayed due to some passengers in economy wanting to pick were they wanted to sit rather than were they were allocated. Ground staff in Bangkok also excellent, Qatar Airways will soon have their own lounge there rather than use the Thai lounge. Any negatives only that I seem to have lost my privilege club silver status, have to check my points.**ASKED TICKET";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-16;" |  Abu Dhabi to Perth return via Doha. Little to be said about connecting flights to / from Abu Dhabi. The Doha to Perth leg was on a Boeing 777-300 in 3x4x3 configuration, the return an aircraft with the old 3x3x3 seating. It would be wrong to suggest the revised seating is terrible. Leg room was ample, certainly far more generous than the equivalent provided by Etihad for example, and the food and IFE were to the usual high standard. Nonetheless, yet more dumbing down of standards / cutting costs to the point where there is increasingly little to differentiate its economy service from other operators. I lost count of the number of times I was bumped by passing traffic on the flight to Perth. I appreciate why Qatar Airways is pursuing this policy but very disappointing nevertheless.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-16;" |  Having previously flown this route on PIA, I was eager to try absolutely any other airline. Having said that, Qatar with its brilliant reputation and reasonable fares made the obvious choice this time around. They didn't disappoint. We flew out on the 777-300ER (when we booked it was supposed to be the 787 but was later changed to this), where the seats were comfortable (reasonable leg room for Economy class), food was to a high standard and the IFE had a huge selection of movies/TV shows to select from. The staff were courteous at all times as well. From Doha to Islamabad it was the A320 which despite being a smaller aircraft had the similar feel to the 777. The IFE was of the same quality, food (although only served once) too was of the similar high standard. All in all, a fantastic experience and more than likely to fly with them again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-15;" | Johannesburg to Dubai via Doha. I have flown with Qatar Airways a couple of times before. The leg from Jo'burg was quite comfortable especially being a night flight. The menu was good and the inflight entertainment didn't disappoint either. The staff as usual are top notch. However, leg room is limited for almost all window seats on the 787 due to the IFE box under the seats, however, the seat pitch isn't too shabby for economy class.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-14;" |  Atlanta to Kuwait via Doha with Qatar Airways. Great value and service. I managed to get the fare for about $3500 which was far cheaper than any of the other options I had leaving ATL and was impressed with the overall experience. There are a couple of very minor things that might have bothered me if I hadn't got such a good deal. The 2x2x2 configuration seems dated nowadays and the service although great was a little annoying as the attendant who serviced my seat kept trying to suggest things rather that waiting for me to make a decision, but really these are minor comments. Given its a 13 hour flight the I was suitably fed, watered and entertained to have keep me happy. Was there anything absolutely outstanding and noteworthy? No, but there also wasn't anything to significantly complain about. Despite my earlier comment about the configuration, the seats were way better than Delta's business one lay flat and although I gave a good review about AF's long haul BC this was better, even though I can't put my finger on why. I am however looking to my return to USA. The first class lounge at Doha is something to behold. More like a ultra discreet luxe hotel restaurant than a lounge and well worth spending a short time in. The short 45 minute flight to KWI was uneventful, but managed to get a meal in overall great service for a short flight. In summary, for the price it was exceptional.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-14;" | Doha to Dubai with Qatar Airways. Love taking this 40 min flight for I'm always impressed how much quality you can squeeze into such a short period of time. This time we flew on an Al Maha branded A320-200 which I found out was a Qatar Airways owned brand. Brand spanking new. The business class seats were the regular US style domestic first class seats. But much nicer. And as always, a perfect breakfast was served.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-14;" | Copenhagen to Doha with Qatar Airways. This flight answered my query: A350 or Dreamliner? Definitely the Qatar Dreamliner. The seat - excellent. Onboard dining - excellent. Service - excellent. Of course it's the cabin feel that is the only thing that is different on the A350. Yet the Dreamliner to me has a nicer interior design, a more rounded aesthetic, nicer windows and a more spacious lavatory. The only thing I cannot totally get used to is the new Qatar IFE system which just feels cumbersome and to me is not intuitive.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-09;" |  Was very excited to fly on the A350 from Doha to Frankfurt. My first time. Though when I got onboard there really wasn't much of a noticeable difference. I think the Dreamliner already took all the excitement out of this new jet! Spacious cabin. Quiet engines. Impressive entrance. The Dreamliner had first mover advantage. Granted, the engines were very quiet, even at takeoff. Although interior design wise, I found the overhead bins to be very low when open. I whacked my head a few times when getting stuff out. I love the seat on this plane. Very comfortable and private, since you face into the window. One of the best. I have high expectations when flying Qatar for I have had many amazing flights with them. This, unfortunately, was not one of them. The food was so-so (steak was very tough) and I found the IFE on this new A350 very cumbersome to use. I couldn't for the longest time get the touch screen to work. Perhaps it was a single incident. I hope so. I did like the gimmicky 3D map feature on the IFE. It worked similarly to Google maps. You could zoom in/out with your fingers, move the map around thus felt somewhat interactive. The front camera view captivated me for you could actually see the front landing gear during takeoff and landing, which is good at the actual moment of touchdown. I love big windows, however, the windows on this A350 annoyed me. In order to close the shades with the electronic button you had to reach way down between the wall and the panel of your seat. Was very difficult to reach. I was expecting a button on the control panel to close the windows, but alas none. Very badly designed seat/window for the wall paneling of the seat by your head is too high and covers the window buttons. Looking forward to my return flight on the Boeing 787 to see  how the two compare.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-07;" |  Dubai to Doha. It's amazing what you can squeeze into a 40 min flight! Qatar Airways served me a full breakfast on this short flight from Dubai to Doha. Plus row 1 in the A330 is very comfortable, since the long haul biz seat is very spacious, and the service was outstanding.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-06;" |  I flew New York to Doha return on an A350 in Business Class in late October. The plane is quite new, and the business cabin is spacious and airy. There are no overhead bins over center seats, giving the 1-2-1 configured cabin a sense of spaciousness. The seats were truly excellent - spacious, with plenty of nooks and crannies to store things, and with an excellent entertainment system. All of the hardware was truly first rate, which made the less-than-stellar soft-product all the more disappointing. The drawback to the seat configuration is that people travelling together in the center are so far apart that it's hard to converse in a low tone of voice. The food was quite tasty and nicely presented. The cabin attendants did their jobs, and nothing more. The service was polite, perfunctory, and when they finished, they disappeared behind the galley curtains. So much so that some children who got bored started racing around the cabin bumping into seats, waking up their occupants, and then, when they tired of that, they started taking out the life vests and playing with them. It was literally hours before one of the cabin attendants stumbled upon half a dozen life vests strewn on the floor. If there had been an emergency, those vests would have been needed. The cabin attendant merely picked them up and took them with him behind the curtain. The wifi was terrible on both flights. Frequently out of signal, and when there was signal, the speed was atrocious. Barely enough to send and receive emails without attachments. The lavatories were not always maintained to good standard. Overall the experience was not bad, but t was just not particularly great.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-04;" |  Singapore to Amman via Doha with Qatar Airways. It started off quite badly for me when they asked for credit card verification, then kept asking for more. In the air, service and comfort was quite good, and the economy class food was quite good. Three of my flights were on the A350 which is the best of the new aircraft, quite spacious in economy - lots of legroom but the width was a bit cramped, despite being wider than the 787. The Boeing 777 was 10-across and horrible, especially in the middle two seats. At least it was only two hours, but it shows that aircraft selection has a big impact on economy comfort. Apart from the 777, which was unfortunately packed, the other flights were quite empty, increasing the comfort levels and meaning that they offered quite reasonable upgrades on every one of my legs. I got it for the last flight and it was what you'd expect from business class. I also couldn't get the wifi to work on any flight. I think they should just give up on that.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-11-01;" | Stockholm to Doha with Qatar Airways. SAS ground staff (acting for Qatar) did a wonderful job dealing with my range of economy class issues. Seating changes and baggage weights all sorted out in a flash. The Dreamliner was scrambled full, barely one spare seat in all classes. The service was surprisingly prompt and attentive. I'm a fallen ""ex"" top tier member and they still made me feel welcome. Seating was very tight - I don't recall the streamlined leg room being so limited, All in all a tough gig for Qatar airways - crammed as it was I still felt welcome. Well done on a tough job.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-30;" | Hanoi to Bangkok with Qatar Airways. The only negative that I can think of for this flight is that it was much too short. Check-in service at the business class counter was immediate, efficient, and friendly. Qatar uses a multi-airline lounge at HAN which offers mediocre food and spirits but spectacular views of the runway and tarmac. There were very few passengers on the HAN-BKK segment, so boarding did not have to be ""organized"" in any fashion. Despite a very quick turnaround, the plane was clean, neat, and well-prepared. The welcome drink included a choice of two different champagnes. I chose the Billecart-Salon, which was excellent. The snack service was quick and tasty, accompanied by another glass of champagne. The seat back TV screens are huge, with a clear and sharp picture. I entertained myself with the sky-map, but if the flight had been longer, there was a huge selection of movies, TV shows, and music. Departure and arrival were punctual, and Qatar provides a pass to allow J class passengers to use an expedited immigration line at BKK. I wish I could have stayed onboard for the next segment to Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-30;"Dallas Ft Worth to Delhi via Doha, and this is the business class that spoils you for life. Flying home on another highly-touted carrier a few weeks later was a bit of a letdown after being so pampered on Qatar Airways. Meals when you want them, wonderful pyjamas, comfy beds/seats - didn't even get a chance to walk around as I usually do, because it was just so nice in our little piece of paradise. The shorter leg to DEL featured also excellent service - this was unexpected as the flight was in the middle of the night and so much shorter.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-25;"Helsinki to Melbourne via Doha. Inaugural flight from Helsinki, the A350 was amazing. The business class seats looked a lot better than the ones on the Boeing 777-300. (Really wish I had taken up the business class email upgrade offer). The cabin felt great and the entertainment system was excellent with no lag at all with swiping and so on. The camera options were great too. Food was excellent, gin tonic with ice even, wine and cognac and coffee. Downside was the repetitive adverts and the safety video revolving around Barcelona and football which quickly got very annoying. I pre-selected vegetarian meal on both flights but was only served it on the 2nd leg, the normal food being served looked much better to be honest. Hotel stopover was good, hotel could maybe be a little closer to airport and center of Doha. Only complaints from 2nd leg was that mine and neighbouring person had something stuck in the audio jacks so could not use headphones and entertainment system was old and lagging.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-25;" |  Our return trip from Heathrow to Perth via Doha was amazing. We flew business class and spent some time at the Qatar lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow. We had lunch there and drinks and lazed away our time til our flight was called. Inflight service for the London/Doha leg was impeccable, excellent staff who literally did all they could to make our trip wonderful - the food was lovely and again was amazed how much room there is in Business Class and the width of the seat. Doha/Perth was fantastic too, we were given complimentary pyjamas and the staff not only made us feel very welcome their service was great. Thanks again Qatar for fantastic flights in both economy and Business Class. Definitely would book this airline again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-25;" |  My husband and myself flew for the first time with Qatar in mid August from Perth to London Heathrow return via Doha.  Check in was the easiest I have experienced and once on board the plane our seats were really quite roomy and we were made very comfortable. The cabin service was excellent and the food very good. The Entertainment system was easy to use and had a good selection of various films, music, tv shows and games etc. I have flown with other airlines but I think Qatar Airways is far and away the best airline I have flown with.

The lounge at Doha is ok but services tardy from serving food to shower. The shared lounge at Singapore should be avoided and the airport lounge at Kilmanjaro was bad. The seats were comfortable, entertainment on both flights were archaic. The free WiFi is non existent.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-21;" |  Colombo to Cairo return via Doha return in October 2016. All widebody, newer A330-200 aircrafts. All flights full and on time (one had an ignorable delay), service on ground and on plane top notch. Long stay-overs, long time lounge access, and potential immigration issues were sorted out smoothly by Qatar Airways ground staff. First Class DOH-CAI-DOH is de facto just only business class but in widebody. On the outbound they served only breakfast and no meat-dishes were offered. Likewise no fresh garlic, ginger, chilli nor fish-sauce is available. No ice-cream, mango smoothies (only strawberry). But the extensive drink list and the cabin staff service made it somehow up. On Cairo to Doha it was a more fully fledged menu with excellent options. From Cairo pre-departure champagne was not offered due to local laws. Cost cutting edges has also begun to show in Doha, where they stopped a la carte servings in Al Mourjan lounge. However, in the alternative Al Safwa first class lounge they provide even fully fledged free “hotel rooms” inside the lounge. Last leg DOH-CMB was operated by Sri Lankan who also did well (see my other review for the Sri Lankan leg). Qatar Airways takes particularly good care of their elite frequent flyers. They facilitated check in at airside, avoidance of immigration problem, and provided extended time lounge visits. First time I avoided bus drives in Doha airport that gives a much better overall impression.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-17;" |  Good airline if you book through their website, turn up 4 hours before departure and can get a good seat. Terrible if anything goes wrong. Excellent food, comfortable seats and vaguely attentive staff. The check-in at Manila airport took 90 mins. I flew from Manila to London to visit my Mum, who was in hospital with cancer. My wife and I did not realise that the 00:40 am departure required boarding the previous day. We phoned the airline in panic and they decided to waive their 'no show' policy on compassionate grounds. They quoted me a fee of about $130 to change my departure date and said we did ""not have to pay for a second ticket"". The lady on the phone confirmed that my return flight did not need changing. I agreed to the payment. A few days later our credit card bill showed a huge deduction. It has taken me 2 months of emails to get 2 replies from Qatar Airways. The replies make little sense. It's now apparent that Qatar Airways changed all my flights after I spoke to them on the phone. They moved me to the most expensive Economy fare, changed my seating and charged me a so-called 'price difference'. This was done without my knowledge or permission. So much for their compassion.

qatar-airways;2016-10-14;"Just flew with Qatar Airways from Perth to Barcelona via Doha, and Barcelona to Singapore via Doha to experience three aircraft types. The daily Boeing 777 service from Perth to Doha is excellent and we prefer to fly the Boeing 777 when we can. We enjoyed the A330-200 service from Doha to Barcelona and return, then had our first crack at the A350 from Doha to Singapore. First thing to say is the service is consistently excellent in Business Class with Qatar, and we would love it if Qantas was aligned with Qatar, which is our airline of choice over Emirates, even though this costs us in terms of status credits and frequent flier points. Qatar is a step ahead of Emirates, but QF frequent fliers are penalised if they choose QR. We were not overly impressed with the A350, especially with no independent air vent (something shared with their 787) and we find it a little warm on our flight. We also had a small problem in our seats in the A350 with the divider being stuck in the up position which meant my wife and I were separated to an extent we would normally not experience. Generally, the Qatar Airways experience is outstanding, including the lounge in Doha, although the restaurant in the business lounge no longer offers an a la carte service which is a disappointment. Overall we'll continue to choose Qatar Airways above Emirates.";POSITIVE

The first leg from Shanghai to Doha was terrible - seats were so cramped with the 3-4-3 seat configuration on the B777 that my knees nearly touched the seat in front of mine and I'm only 5'5, plus I didn't have room to stretch out my legs due to the entertainment system box at my toes. The flight attendants had forgotten that I had requested a vegetarian meal, (fortunately there was a vegetarian option on the regular menu) and they kept waking people up for the meal service even though our flight left Shanghai at midnight. The saving grace was the amenity bag. However, when we boarded our flight to Madrid, it was like two completely different airlines. The Boeing 787 was spacious, and the flight attendants were friendly and the vegetarian options were tasty - the other passengers even asked if they could have what I was having. Our flight back to Shanghai was a marked improvement on the first flight. Even though it was a Boeing 777 again with the 3-4-3 seating, we had a lot more leg room this time around. The service was more in line with what we experienced going to and leaving from Madrid. I would give them a perfect score if it wasn't for that first leg.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-10-10;" |  Kuala Lumpur to Paris and back via Doha in business class. You may experience some very minor hiccups or confusion on the ground, especially ex-Doha (e.g. I'm not sure why placing the correct luggage tag on my suitcase required a meeting of three ground staff - they never explained what the issue was. I got the impression that European travelers tend to receive colder treatment than others, but that is not exclusive to Doha airport. But once you're in the air, everything is wonderful. The crew treat you like an old friend. The service comes across as not only efficient and courteous but warm, sincere and lighthearted when the occasion calls for it. Well done.

Seat was comfy enough but on the B787 it lacked storage. From what I read, seats in the A350 seemed to have more storage. Flights from Singapore to Rome and vice versa were supposed to be the A350 but switched to B787 a few months before departure - really disappointed with this. Business lounge in Doha was great, far better than SQ lounge in Changi Airport. But they did not have the a la carte menu and Krug Champagne on the Mezzanine floor restaurant. A sign of cost cutting measure? The range of Asian movies onboard is also very limited. Worst of all, their flights seemed to depart at odd hours, for example 2.30am from Singapore to Doha and vice versa. ";POSITIVE

It’s nice to have an international route on a local stretch which sets new standards for the region. Check in took only a minute, very few passengers on this route. Onboard FA’s were polite, correct, professional, focused and caring – however, service was limited to approx. 10 minutes of effective service (flight took only 45 Minutes of time), but drinks with options were provided. Only for 5 minutes were seatbelt sign switched off. The lounges used in SGN and PNH are 3rd party lounges but both of excellent quality.

Yes, we were delayed but safety comes first. We were put on a second Boeing 787 and again the crew were fantastic, food excellent and I will not hesitate to fly Qatar again.

The seat was very comfortable with amazing legroom and backrest / headrest. The welcome amenities were quite good and useful. However, the entertainment system technology needs a lot of thought - the right button on one of my co-passenger's screen didn't work which left her with only 4/5 movie options and was very annoying. Even though they have a great selection, the hardware needs an upgrade. The call attendant button or light button did not work on my seat remote control. Also, I had multiple issues with air hostesses both on Mumbai-Doha and Doha-Atlanta leg. Even after the call attendant button was pressed, none of the air-hostesses paid attention and I had to call them while they were passing by in the aisle. I could see 3-4 other attendant lights switched on but nobody came by for 10 minutes or so.  The meal timings were really bad. After they served us brunch at 11:30 AM Doha time, no food was served till almost 6 PM. Having reached Doha at 5 AM, just having 1 meal till evening was not what I had in mind. When asked for food, the air hostess said we will be serving sandwiches in some time. The overall experience was okay but had these issues not been there, it would have been amazing.";POSITIVE

The seats assigned seemed to be entirely random, no effort was made to keep us together, preference for window or aisle were largely ignored. My seat gave average legroom and width. The arms of the seat on the Boeing 777LR only go up about 3/4 of the way making it extremely difficult to get out of the row, especially when the seat in front is reclined. If there are empty seats you can't lie down unless you can fit under the partially extended arms. We had a 15+ hour flight from Doha, we departed about 8am from Doha an average breakfast was served at 9am, we received a bag of chips about 5 hours later. They came around with drinks several times and our choice was a juice or water, drinks were served at room temperature no ice was provided. After 8 hours from breakfast they served us a small chicken or vegetarian pasty with a small brownie. a fuller selection of drinks was offered, no ice unless you asked.  After 6 hours with no snacks they offered a dinner. I thought the food service was meager and food quality was average, snacks were nearly non existent. Drink choices during the flight were minimal, the lack of ice was disappointing. I picked Qatar Airways because I read many glowing reviews about extra service and space, but found the flight in economy very average. The entertainment options were very good, but my remote on the trip to Johannesburg did not work properly, on the return trip the remote would not stay in place and hung down on the back of the seat. On the 8 hour flight to Johannesburg they offered after departure and a small pastry after 7 hours, no other snacks were offered. There are 4 bathrooms on the Boeing 777 in economy and nearly a constant line of people waiting to use them. We ran out of hand towels on my flight after about 5 hours. I was underwhelmed by the service, economy I would rate as average. If you are flying economy take some snacks and adjust your expectation to average service.";NEGATIVE

My only complaint was, that I had seats booked for over 10 months and then a few weeks before the flight, they changed my seats. I rang them and they said it was probably because of medical reasons, that the people sitting in my seats needed access to the toilets etc. When we got on board, the 4 seats in question were occupied by young men travelling alone? On the way back, one seat was left vacant, totally wasted. So, the moral of the story is, don't bother booking seats. They gave our away seats for some unknown reasons and wouldn't change them back. They even had my husband and I sitting in different parts of the plane when they changed them and didn't notify me. It was only that I went on line to have a look, that I noticed the changes. Luckily, there were still 2 seats together that I could change to but nowhere near where I wanted to sit. Also, the Check in at Venice Marco Polo Airport was chaotic.

Breakfast was not particularly inspiring. I ordered the continental breakfast of fruit and bread. The quality was not as good as I expected. Overall I was not overly impressed.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-09-06;" |  Brussels to Tokyo Narita via Doha. The check-in was ok smooth, but I wasn't offered any special seats despite my OW Sapphire status. The security fast-track which should have been on my ticket barcode didn't work, I had to call staff to let me go in. BA lounge access not up to mid/longhal standards required for the 6 hour flights to DOH. There are no shower facilities and the food choices are limited to a breakfast setup, despite the evening departure.  QR boarded their flight one hour ahead of depature time which seems excessive. On top of poor seat width, the pitch seemed too tight, and I'm not a giant. There was a IFE box stealing 20% of my feet area and no footrest. Storage in the seat pocket was poor, I couldn't fit my water bottles. PTV remote was covered in smudges. I had ordered a special meal, low fat, which was pasta. The pasta was dry. The fruit salad showed signs of decay. The salad looked ok but the vinaigrette tasted awful. The bread was not freshly baked. In the bathroom, no amenities were offered in economy. The marking on the flushing button in the bathroom was unreadable. The cabin temperature was cold, but a good fleece blanket offered. I asked the cabin crew to raise the temperature and was answered that the captain would have to decide on that. IFE systems was loaded with advertisement. The flight stopped at a remote stand and we had to be bussed.  After deplaning, I was suppposed to have 2 hours between flights to enjoy in the business cass lounge, but I only spent 5 minutes in there.";NEGATIVE

Every seat in economy had a pillow, a blanket, headphones, and a bag of things that you can freshen up with (Toothpaste, toothbrush, socks, eye pad) The inflight entertainment was great, but the paid inflight WIFI didn't work very well. The meals were pretty good, I tried breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They do give you a lot so you will not be hungry. Overall good airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-09-04;"Adelaide to Barcelona via Doha. Qatar Airways is the best airline we have flown with respect to comfort, food, and service, and their amenity kits are the best too. Being able to choose when to have your meals is a real bonus and the choices were good. There were a few hitches though. On the Adelaide to Doha leg (A350), my seat would not go all the way into the sleep position - there was a 6 inch gap between the fixed 'foot end' and the seat, and the head end was raised somewhat. Despite this, it was still very comfortable. There was only one movie which was anything close to my taste - more choice is needed for long-haul flights, in this case 13 hours. Qatar Airport was a big let-down. Why they don't have air-bridges is a mystery, especially in such a harsh climate.";POSITIVE

Transit at Doha was not bad at all, took the free city tour offered by the airline which was a nice way to spend time and seeing the city. Boeing 787 is a good plane to be flying in, given the large windows, but in terms of space I think it is similar to that on the Boeing 777 or A330. Overall satisfied with everything. The free wifi during the flight is only provided for 15 mins.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2016-08-30;" |  Sydney to Athens via Doha. The inflight experience is what I am paying for in deciding to fly business. The initial minor problems in the Sydney to Doha leg seemed to arise from our seats being in the last row in the business class section. On boarding the flight to Doha we were asked if we would like pyjamas. On replying yes, we were told only XXL was left, which were so big we could not use them. We were then asked to choose dinner. I asked for dinner to be served as soon as the plane had reached its cruising altitude. When dinner was served, approximately 30 minutes after take off, I was told my choice of wine had run out. So, of the 3 white wines available (not a great selection in the first place) the one I had chosen had run out within 30 minutes of take off. Similarly, when dessert was served we were told the one dessert wine available which we had asked for had also run out. The crew member told us only 2 half bottles had been available for the whole of the business class cabin. We complained to the cabin supervisor who apologised and said they had in fact found some dessert wine and brought us a glass. It all just seemed a little poorly organised and executed. These are small points, but this is exactly why I am willing to pay double the cost of an economy ticket for a business class service. It is the small details that make the difference. Without them, I might as well be in economy. The main problem was my seat would not fully extend to flat. The foot rest remained vertical, so it was not possible to lie down. Staff attempted to physically fix it but were unable to do so. The seat had jammed halfway between upright and flat. 3 staff spent approximately 30 minutes under the seat trying to fix it. This was about halfway through the flight, during which time we both had to stand in the aisle while they tried to fix it. The flight was full, so there was nowhere else we could go. So neither of us were able to sleep fully during the flight. On asking how we would be able to land with the seat stuck in this position, the crew suggested I might have to sit in a crew jump seat as there were no other seats available. In the end, they physically pushed the seat back into a semi-upright position that they said was sufficient for landing purposes. But no sleep for me or my partner. The cabin supervisor suggested I write in to complain. More than 6 weeks later I'm still waiting for a response to my initial email. ";NEGATIVE

Inflight experience was great. Seats with good leg room considering I'm 6ft 2in. Inflight staff were courteous and helpful. Great food in terms of taste and quality. Great selection of wine. The best part was the Free Qatar City tour. What a great gesture by the airlines for transit of more than 8 hrs. Three cheers to Qatar Airways and it's certainly a five star airline.";POSITIVE

Boeing 787 business class with Qatar Airways is the best I have flown, beats Singapore Airlines, Etihad and Emirates. Very airy cabin, large windows, excellent seat, superb food, friendly and speedy service by the flight attendants with a good choice of drinks. Emirates better only when it comes to the IFE system and in-flight Internet, Singapore Airlines on par for catering, better only when using ""book the cook"" advance meal choice. Shorter Doha - Dubai leg on 777-300ER but the cabin and seat do not match the 787. Would definitely fly Qatar Airways again if on the 787.";POSITIVE

The 2nd leg was most enjoyable especially with the A350-900. Ample space, good seat reclining and pitch. The IFE and wifi on board was superb. The mood lighting was intriguing and finally the cabin crew was warm and friendly. Sadly the Doha to Lagos was a serious downgrade after such an enjoyable 12hrs 1st leg. I've recommended this airline as the value of the service exceeds the cost and long hours connecting to ones destination.";POSITIVE

We got pillows and blankets on all flights and a kit with toothbrush, toothpaste, earplugs, socks and eyemask on the A350's. As always on Qatar good service (especially on QR947) and entertainment system. If I have to complain it would be over there's only 15min free wi-fi onboard even if long haul flights.

The IFE on the B787 was not as good as the A380, though. If I could recommend one thing is that they update the Boeing's IFE. Otherwise it was perfect. Everything was smooth. Especially the layover at Doha. What a nice airport. Both flights were on time and was almost no hassle at all. I slept easily on both. Can't wait to fly with them again. I am quite tall, yet I had loads of space on the A380. Great plane. Space on the Boeing was good.";POSITIVE

Love the window dimming and cabin lighting.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-08-08;"We flew from Manchester to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways, I did find the check in clerk at Manchester Airport quite abrupt when asking for the exit row seats for both flights as I am 6 ft 4 tall. She said let me check and she had to ask her manager but she did not respond until we got our boarding passes and found out we had the exit row to Doha but not from Doha to Bangkok. The first leg of the flight was on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in economy. This was a fantastic aircraft and it was very quiet, the food and service and entertainment was spot on from Manchester to Doha and we had the exit row which made it easier for me to stretch my legs. We only had a one hour transfer time at Hamad International Airport. The Airport was huge and it was so modern and clean. We boarded the A380 for our flight to Bangkok, this aircraft is huge and I found the economy seats to be very comfortable with large IFE screens to watch the entertainment to pass the time. Again the service and the food was fantastic and we were in Bangkok in no time. Flying back to Manchester via Doha from Bangkok I asked again for the exit rows in Bangkok and if we could sit upstairs in the small economy section on the A380, this was successful but we did not get the exit row on the A380 but it was nice to be sat in the small economy section upstairs. Both flights home were on time and the service and food was spot on. I can't recommend Qatar Airways highly enough to others.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-08-04;" |  Singapore to New York JFK return via Doha. I have flown this route 3 times in the last 8 months with 3 different carriers. My favorite is Qatar Airways.  The first noticeable difference is the ease of navigating their website which is well organised and easy to get to the required services. Check-in at Singapore was quick and completed within 15 mins including the time I started queuing in line to get checked-in. The smooth check-in experience was repeated again in JFK with a knowledgeable staff who was professional, friendly and accommodating. Worth mentioning is Qatar Airway's use of Terminal 7 at JFK. It could be sheer luck but on both occasions at arrival and departure, I did not experience the massive crowds that I had experienced in other JFK terminals. The seats are organised in a 3-3-3 configuration and each seat comes with a large touch screen tv with a separate console for controls. The feel and look of the tv is much sleeker than those of the other 2 carriers I have flown and comes with more varied programming. Another well designed feature is the toilets which come with a decent sized wash basin and a wet tissue dispenser for cleaning the toilet seats. Ample food options were available even though I sat close to the back of the plane. There are no overhead cabins for the last 4 to 5 rows of seats in the middle block but there does not seem to be any problems accommodating everyone's bags. Some of the cabin crew looked rather new on the job but it was clear that they all worked hard to accommodate everyone's requests. Definitely an airline I would consider highly on my next long haul flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-08-03;" |  Zagreb to Perth via Doha. We have previously flown with Qatar and had a very pleasant experience, However, this particular flight was not as pleasant due to the fact Qatar Airways had introduced the new Boeing 777-300 seats, new configuration plane (3x4x3). We had 3 seats between the 2 of us and thank goodness as I would not have survived with 3 people in the row of 3. The armrest was not big enough for 2 arms, the depth of the seat was considerably smaller. The width was smaller as I could not fit my hand down between the arm rest and myself. Sadly we will not be travelling with Qatar Airways again when going to Europe and will choose to pay slightly more for economy with another airline just to know we will get adequate leg and seat room.";NEGATIVE

The aircraft was not full it was an empty seat beside me. Every seat had a pillow, a blanket and a headset. The service was very good: we got a complete lunch (lamb with rice, salad, cookie) and a sandwich one hour before landing. The crew was excellent I can recommend the airline very much.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-08-01;" |  I was flying the second time this year with Qatar Airways from Athens to Johannesburg via Doha. Both round trips were, considering the cabin class, very pleasant flights. Flights on time, staff friendly, service and meals onboard without any complaint. Very positive was the generous leg room and the comfortable seat on all used planes (777, 787, 330). The on board entertainment has a huge selection of movies and worked perfectly. The only thing I found annoying on my trip in June, was the very strict application of the baggage weight limits and the hefty fee that QR charged per extra kg. However, based on this and earlier experience, I would choose this airline again for my business trips. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-08-01;"Kuala Lumpur - Doha - Berlin TXL on Sun 31st July (B777-300ER and A330). QR flight to KUL had arrived ahead of schedule and was looking forward to an on time departure. After sitting on the plane for over 1 hr already, were absolutely amazed by the Qatar policy to let people board the plane still 50 minutes after departure time (9.45 am and 10.35), people were simply late and kept other passengers waiting on this Sunday morning - very good weather and no traffic problems in KUL. Why on earth do they start boarding the aircraft before 9 am when they let people board until 10.35 way behind the schedule? Having known this, we would have slept 1½ hrs longer as well. Take off 11.16 am leaving many passengers worried about their onward connections. Unfortunately, this flight was worse in several areas than the usual quality experience on QR: delayed boarding that was simply unacceptable, tight seating 3-4-3 with good 33"" seat pitch though, mediocre food and small portions and the general feeling of being cramped on board. The mid-flight snacks could be healthier as well: always white bread which is far too sweet, very sweet cakes or crisps - 6/10 only. DOH - TXL on A333 the same Sunday afternoon was another story: excellent boarding with on-time departure from DOH, pleasant and highly motivated cabin crew, three options for lunch (beef-chicken-vegetarian), water and juices served three-four times during the flight and an early arrival at TXL. The meal service was exemplary with two + two carts in economy plus one hostess serving the last five-six rows from the rear galley, which seemed fast & efficient. The IFE with smaller screens on this 11-year old Airbus was not as good as on their newer planes, however, this flight was excllent compared to our first leg on QR the same morning and deserves 9/10.";POSITIVE

Since the next flight was 24hr later, we were offered by Qatar airways and compensation of 250USD. To claim the 250 USD we had to go Dar Es Salaam to the Qatar office. Unfortunately, there was no office at the airport for arriving passengers. We couldn't go to the departure hall since we had no valid ticket to leave Dar Es Salaam. In Zanzibar airport, the office was closed. Back in Qatar, they said at the transit office that we should go to Brussels and claim it there, and Brussels they told us that we should have claimed the money in Doha. Although the flights were great, services in the airports a real mess.";POSITIVE

FA is very caring to customer's need, a FA had realized a passenger had red eyes when serving meals, and she quickly provided eye drops.

On arrival to Doha a proactive ground crew approached us to make some remedy for the flight that we had missed. He said that our flight is rebooked for the next day and they will send us in a hotel. The hotel was more than enough to my expectation and meal allowance is included.  The staff of the hotel are also welcoming and hospitable, and I also had the chance to meat my friend who is working in the Bank in Doha. He serve as my tour guide when we walk around the city. Thank you Qatar Airways for making my Doha journey a memorable one. ";POSITIVE

The IFE was great, switched on from boarding until we left the plane, and a great variety to choose from - not very different to my last experience on Emirates when flying them to Jo'burg.

Aircrafts are fairly new and well maintended, and in general, all crew members are efficient. I have to say I really like this sense of multiculturalism there is on board. I normally fly Qatar for long haul flights, and the ammenities provided are kinda nice, especially for red-eye flights (eye mask, toothpaste and toothbrush, etc). I don't really need it, as I like sleeping while flying or read my own books, but the inflight entertainment system has lots of options, too. The last two times I used Qatar I had the same thought about food, maybe it's all about my own expectations, but it could be better. It just feels average if you compare it with others. Last time snacks were not that good and not really varied (it was also because due to time difference I had breakfast x 2, snaks x2 - felt very repetitive). I was unlucky to sit in the middle of the cabin, so once the crew served us, out of the 3 options available, only 1 was left. Even if Qatar is usually not the most affordable, I wouldn't doubt to fly with them again.";POSITIVE

Arriving 3 hours before flight, it took us 1.5 hours to get the boarding pass. 30-40 people waiting in the line, and only 1 counter is available to do the check in. We and other people ending up boarding last on the plane.  Upon arrival for transit at DOH, we were greeted with the sign that passengers to KUL please report to staff. We learned, from the first staff that our flight was overbooked by 50 people. For pax from Munich, they decided to bump us to the next flight. They offered us $250 voucher (not cash) and get on the next plane which will arrive 8 hours later. As that means we will miss the connecting flight and they do not offer to compensate for that connecting flight, we refused the offer. Also, how come it impacted us when we checked in successfully not even 6 hours before. There were several group of passengers. Then the story change, it is not overbooked but technical difficulties. After heated arguments with the ground staff, we indeed can get into the plane, the seat next to me at the plane is empty. It is not until we arrived at KUL that I learned the previous flight for DOH-KUL was cancelled. ";NEGATIVE

For the price you paid, you get personable service from the cabin crews as well as access to the world's best onboard bar/lounge. Cabin feels intimate as capacity is capped at 48 people. There is no luggage overhead in the middle section of the cabin, so the class feels very roomy/spacious. The only complain that I have is the rather horrible Wi-Fi connection, which is very slow and capped at 15 minutes for business class passengers. Other than that, everything is quite perfect.";POSITIVE

The 777-300ER and 787 planes are modern and keep the noise levels low. Was slightly dissapointed by the fact that in 777-300ER Qatar Airways followed other airlines and switched from 3-3-3 layout to 3-4-3 layout obviously reducing the space and cutting the Economy class seat. However, it was not as bad as I thought it would be, the seats are modern with thinner padding but still comfortable. The IFE needs some improvement in the overall GUI and film choice. The food quality deteriorated over the last 3 years that I have flown with them. Portion's seem to be smaller and the food not as good as before. Overall, for the price we paid for return flights and when comparing the overall experience with European carriers I will not hesitate to choose Qatar again.";POSITIVE

On two of these flights I had a tall person sitting behind me and therefore I could not put my seat down and I felt very squashed and unable to watch TV as it was too close to the face. I always pre-order a vegetarian meal and I was pleasantly surprised that I received a different meal on all 3 flights and all 3 were very tasty.

The menu had a very good choice of main meals and also something vegetarian. The bar at the back of Business Class has an airy feel to it. I travelled with my husband and we decided to have the two seats in the middle. He is a terrible traveller but he managed to sleep for 5 hours and felt very refreshed when we got to London. We had a 4-hour layover in Doha and their Business Class lounge is also very good which makes the long flight with stopover much more pleasurable.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-07-11;" |  We went back to Qatar Airways after a disappointing flight with Emirates recently and were very happy that we did. Whereas Emirates appear to cut corners in business class, Qatar get this all right. The business lounge at Heathrow is exceptional, great staff, facilities and a superb restaurant with waiter-served gourmet food on offer and a good wine/drinks selection. Boarding was quick and close by. The seats on Q002 to Doha and then onto Denpasar, are 2/2/2 config. If you are not a couple, choose a centre seat, or your window 'partner' will have to climb over you for a toilet visit. The centre seats both have direct aisle access. Seats are not super-wide, but are comfortable and recline fully. The one idea Qatar could take from Emirates is the extra padded seat-base provided, just to make lying down a bit softer if you want to properly sleep. TV screens are big, like Emirates, but unlike Emirates, are high quality/pixelated, so no grainy movies on a huge screen which hurt your eyes. Large choice of movies, mini-series, etc. Qatar staff are tremendous, quite the most eager to please off all airlines I've flown in a long time. Food selection is excellent and served as though in a restaurant, heated and then decanted onto china plates, arranged gourmet style with perfectly heated, fresh bread. Onboard Wifi on both airlines is quite useless but that's a developing technology. The transfer in DOH (to the DPS flight), was a very long walk (15 minutes) but no buses at least and we used the time to stretch our legs. Overall, we'd certainly choose Qatar over Emirates again, even if the fares (which vary considerably) are more expensive to fly with Qatar. We've also seen dates where Qatar is considerably cheaper than Emirates. To sum up, flying with Qatar still feels like 'real' business class. ";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2016-07-09;"Had a 6½ hr delay leaving Doha, but the Qatar Airways onboard experience with their quality foods and beverages by excellent cabin crew made the flight pleasant. However, this flight was terrorized by a 2-year-old toddler who screamed and cried and shouted nonstop without any attempts from her parents to comfort her nor trying to keep her volumes down. This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest. I don't fly to make friends but I always respect the privacy of my fellow travellers without putting them into such noisy, ugly nor ill-tempered torture, which was the case on QR852 from DOH to KUL this time. QR is a quality airline and I hope they find innovative solutions to this problem in the long run.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-07-04;" |  Flew Qatar Airways from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. Usual high quality product but far from 10/10 perfection, notably departure and arrival into Abu Dhabi. Good points: pristine aircraft and crew, inflight entertainment, excellent timekeeping. As a Silver Privilege card holder I benefit from accessing the upper-deck 'snug' on the A380 at no extra cost. This is at least equivalent to the inflated-price Premium Economy provided by European airlines - excellent. Particularly impressed with Heathrow. On arrival, immigration cleared and bags collected in less than 15 minutes even for a Chinese passport holder. On departure from T4, no queue at check-in - although other airlines appeared to have issues - with ample seating, excellent wifi and refreshment options at High Street prices in the departure lounge, £1 for a Boots' sandwich, a steal. Gripes: in common with other middle east airlines, the continued use of buses at Doha that dump connecting passengers at furthest distance from the departure terminal - minimum 20 minute walk - albeit, for both legs, without a requirement to pass through further security checks(?), continual promotion of complimentary wifi on the aircraft that seldom actually worked and, in any event, is only 'complimentary' for a maximum of 10 minutes during the flight. The inadequacies of AUH are well documented elsewhere. Suffice, with Qatar departures at 0555 and 0645 - the former a B777/A332 - check-in was chaotic with woefully inadequate provision of desks and organization of queues which, fortunately, on this occasion, did not delay departure. This is a daily event so no excuses. On return to AUH, after the interminable taxi to the far end of the airport, thereafter a 30 minute wait for ground services to provide stairs to the obligatory bus and an hour to clear immigration, Accepted airport travails are largely outside the control of the airline. Nonetheless, Qatar surely has the wasta to secure improvement, especially at Doha? AUH may be a lost cause, however. I would lose no sleep were Qatar to switch additional resources to DWC and offer an express coach from Abu Dhabi centres in lieu of serving AUH. Indeed, were the policy pursued I would likely benefit from additional sleep.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-07-04;" |  I travelled twice with Qatar Airways on the routing HAN-CPH return – totally 12 sectors from CPH to HAN via DOH and BKK and the same on return. 8 of these were on business, the other 4 on economy. 3 different aircraft all of high quality and maintenance standards: B787, A380, and B777-300. Check-in was handled kindly and smart in CPH, despite I was a bit demanding: I needed to coordinate three check-in’s as I travelled with family members in economy class. Lounge access granted perfectly, even to family. Luggage handled perfectly and arrived on time. All flights on time. This airline is a solid winner and continues to never disappoint me as the product is very predictable. All departures were on time, earlier, or slightly delayed (in two cases). FA onboard in general are among the very best, quickest, devoted, and most kind that I have experienced. For all 8 business class legs predeparture drinks (inc. champagne) was generously offered. This was for CPH, the first time I experienced that pre-departure champagne was being offered in business class.  Food and wines were good throughout but food is getting less, lesser options, smaller portions, often only one meat choice.  I was given amenity kits on all longhaul sectors and pyjamas on night-flights. The bar in A380 worked well though I’d prefer chairs to sofas – and missed some music or a bit of life. The best lounges were in Doha, but also the ones in Bangkok were good. The third party lounge used in CPH Airport, “Aspire”, disappoints in comparison with those offered in DOH, BKK, and HAN. The biggest faults are the never-ending bus-rides in Doha (at least one bus trip per stopover for me in Doha. Ramadan caused that lounges in Doha were alcohol dry. Onboard long haul flights, I am annoyed by intrusive, repetitive announcements of QR charity support encouragements.";POSITIVE

It was the most pleasurable economy flight I have ever experienced. The the diversified, polite and helpful cabin crew were exceptional. Even their info video for airline safety prior to take off is innovative and refreshing. The food on board was average but still tolerable at the least. Freebies for the little ones including the food tray is exceptional. I would truly consider booking my future flights with this airline and highly recommend it to those who have not flown with them yet.";POSITIVE

First of all, great experience at the check in counter at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi, as my original seat was on the lower deck of the A380, but I requested a seat on the small economy cabin on the upper deck: no problem at all, it was changed in just one minute. Both flights were very decent, great cabin crew and ammenities provided. The only thing worse than expected were the meals, I have had better quality on other airlines which stand, in theory, at lower standards. Excellent overall, and I will always select Qatar Airways if I have the choice.";POSITIVE

If there's only one thing I would change, is to add inflight Wi-Fi to the 777.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-28;" | Frankfurt to Dubai via Doha. Qatar Airways really is in a class of its own when flying Business Class. Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100€ return. Bye, bye, european carriers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-25;" |  Singapore to Zurich via Doha. Very good service in ground and in air too. Aircraft are well designed and crews well behaved. For outbound flight, I preferred long transit, around 12 hours, but didn't get any airport hotel during transit while some other passenger got airport hotel. I talked with information booth, they checked my ticket and said not eligible for airport hotel. Why not? They didn't explain. I think its more airport problem than airline. Still for long transfer passenger, airlines should arrange some accommodation or free lounge at least.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-24;" |  Flew from London Heathrow to Bangkok with transit in Doha with my husband. First leg with Airbus B77W was ok, seat is much more comfortable than 2nd leg A380. Our first flight was delayed an hour in LHR, we were quite concerned we would miss our connecting flight only one hour in Doha. Spoke to two cabin crews, they said there was not much they could do. After landing in Doha, there was no boarding gate so it took a while to reach the departure hall by bus, there is an information counter outside where we came in, however staff weren't being helpful apart from telling us we needed to be fast. The ground staff knew there were about 50 passengers on our flight that were late for their connecting flight, without any help on the ground, me and my husband along with 50 passengers had to run from gate D2 to B3, this was 3 kilometers in distance. The most disappointing part was the food. Pie after pie from Bangkok to London, on the way back the food was even worse. Overall, I wouldn't fly with Qatar again.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-22;" |  Colombo to New York via Doha return with Qatar Airways. In short, this was a memorable experience and the service we received in business class was outstanding. Check in Colombo was smooth although the Araliya lounge did not do justice to Qatar Airways service. A340 between Colombo and Doha had angled, lie-flat seats in 2-2-2 configuration. Service was exceptional except the staff initially forgot to serve my wife the meal she requested. The menu offered all day dining with a good selection of food and wine. Although the transfer ticket pouch states to show this on arrival in Doha there was no ground staff to welcome transit passengers. We had to find our way to the Business Class Lounge, which was not far from the gate. The lounge is an experience in itself, like a mini hotel, with two restaurants, drink stations, two buffets, serviced bars, sleep stations with lie flat couches, toilets with attendants, showers, etc. The lounge was inviting but no announcements are made. We were the last go through security but had no issues. We were looking forward to the A350 and to experience this new aircraft. A350 business class seats are in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access. We had chosen two middle seats to be close to each other. But they were still reasonably apart to provide adequate privacy with a slide-out screen in between the seats. Cabin staff were very welcoming. The amenity kit for this flight really was exceptional with Armani products, noise cancelling headphones and pyjamas. The cabin staff on this flight was exceptional and made you feel valued. The a la carte menu had a wide range of options to choose from any time you like and was complimented by an extensive selection of wines and spirits. The senior flight attendant was helpful setting up my phone for the on-board wi-fi. Equally the flight attendant who was looking after my wife went to the extent of preparing a special vegetarian meal, when she found that what was on the menu did not suit my wife. On arrival in NY, each one came to say goodbye to the passengers which I thought was very graceful. The return flight from NY to Doha was on a B777-200LR, which had lie flat seats in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats were not as new as the A350 but nevertheless were comfortable and managed to get good few hours of sleep ahead of the day out in Doha. There was no wi-fi on this aircraft. The service was good, but having experienced the service on A350, I felt bit disappointed. On the return we enjoyed the Qatar Airways complimentary city tour and had more time to spend in the Business Class Lounge. We had breakfast and lunch in the restaurant. The food didn’t taste as exceptional as on board. However, there was a good selection in the menu as well as in the buffet. Last leg of the journey was on another A346 and the service was not dissimilar.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-21;"Flights with high expectations, considering good reviews. From Sydney staff seemed like they were enjoying their job and had a genuinely nice attitude, which was only slighly ameliorated by tiredness of serving 14 hours fully loaded flight. Food of good quality but in minuscule amounts, limited choice of spirits. Seats were of a nice modern design, generally comfortable, however did not leave much room for shoulders so sitting next to someone of a larger build meant some bodily contact. Layout 3-4-3 did not help much. Also legroom spoke of BA standards (Which is not a compliment). Entertainment had a good amount of options to choose from, but clearly less than Emirates. Not that intutive in use. Flight to Warsaw had paradoxally more a relaxing feeling, better seats, more classic in shape, but no alcohol offered, possibly thanks to Ramadan. Entertainment less extensive, but perfectly adequate. Staff polite and helpful. Overall - Good flights? Absolutely,however for similar money I would rather opt for Emirates in future. Looking forward to flying back to Australia on their newish large airbuses.";POSITIVE

After take-off the massage function went on and could not be switched off. The apologetic cabin crew director tried to help, rebooted the system several times but could not fix the problem. As there was no other seat available, I had to stay in my allocated seat and I ended up sitting upright, where the impact of the massage was a bit less then in any other position. Instead off sleeping in my bed/seat I got a massage for the 6 hour flight. The experience was like a joke, although the crew was friendly and apologizing. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-17;" |  Doha to Paris with Qatar Airways. A great flight, near perfect, because I like the semi-open yet private configuration on the new 777, even soft lighting is an improvement. The seat is one of the best, the flat-bed is smooth. For me the Qatar Business Class is the best. The meal service is first class like : you can choose meal time and a-la-carte. In this case, either a supper or breakfast (as flight departs 1:20am) and serving time is at your choice. You pre-order your choice. Pyjamas and Armani overnight kit are provided. The Indian dish is delicious though I shall skip the Arabian courses. A most comfortable flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-16;" |  Taif to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. 8th June 2016 TIF to DOH A320 Excellent flight. No Business class seats so the leg was in First class. Catering excellent and service on board was second to none! The crew was extremely attentive hat off to the cabin services supervisor and her staff. The Food was superb and the in flight entertainment very good for short haul. The Qatar business lounge at Hamad airport was dry (no alcohol) because it was Ramadan. This for an international traveler transiting through an airport is a big thumbs down for me as I like a glass of wine with my meal. This in future will cause me to chose another airline during this time of year. The second leg was on a Qatar A380. Again excellent service although with 50 plus business class seats the boarding was a bit like economy with a posh seat. Takes a long time to give the personal service I like when boarding. IE welcome drink, towel, pjs and menus etc. The cabin services manager must have seen me frowning and I got everything pretty sharpish after that. The in flight entertainment on this leg kept locking and needed resetting. Also people using their own headsets had damaged the headset jack that resulted in loss of quality of sound in my seat. The food was superb again. I enjoyed being able to walk around and use the the stand up bar and lounge area at the back of the business class section. This is very nice and it stops people gathering in the galley area to get drinks and chat. Qatar always provides me with outstanding service and I love flying only with them if where I am going is one of their routes. Well done to all the staff who took care of me on this flight. Hats off to you!!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-14;"Manchester to Islamabad via Doha with Qatar Airways. A very pleasant flight Manchester to Doha - excellent cabin crew service. Due to light load plenty of rows were empty and pax were able to lie flat if they so wished. A7-BAX was a new aircraft and the new type of seats were found to be much more comfortable than the earlier ones. Flight departure was on schedule and arrived early which gave us a comfortable time-gap to transfer to another flight. For lunch there were 3 options and the ones we ordered were very palatable, snacks were readily available throughout the flight. The transfer service at Doha airport was exceptionally good - we had requested wheel chairs and were provided electric 'buggies' from one end of the terminal [B] to end of terminal C and so onto terminal D as well as being escorted onto the bus and up to the aircraft door - we experienced no hassle at all and  would like to thank Qatar Airways ground staff and Doha airport. The flight from Doha to Islamabad was operated by an A320 A7-ADG a mid-aged aircraft, however the cabin was well maintained and the washrooms were clean - we found this surprising as our experience on this sector has been somewhat different on other airlines. The service by the cabin crew lived upto the 5* image, however we felt a major shortfall in the dinner offered - only one option of poor quality rice and a spicy curry. The absence of a modern IFE, not even a map display was available, led to tedium. Flight crews on both sectors provided a very smooth flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-10;" |  The Qatar Airways gate security personnel at Doha airport asked some passengers including me to ""empty the contents of your briefcase and carry-on, in as many bins as needed"". For me it took 3 bins, with all the items sitting in the bins for all to see as they rolled along the conveyor belt and reappeared at the other end of the scanning machine while I walked through the people-scanner. When I tried to retrieve my 3 bins at the other end of the conveyor belt, they were not contiguous, and the first was widely separated from the last, with other people's bins in between (I remember seeing other people's dirty laundry, family pictures, a jewelry box, and wad of cash). It was not trivial to re-pack the 3 bin contents into the bags - at the hotel it had taken me half an hour, but I managed to do it in 10 minutes, still too long for the impatient security staff. I heard some of my companions in misfortune use words like never again and this is the last time.";NEGATIVE

Lots of passengers already waiting in line. Only three check-in agents on duty. Schedulded departure time was 18.30 hours, 18.25 hours take-off. Flight was not full - I had a bulkhead seat just behind Business-Class. Friendly welcome by the mostly Thai crew onboard. Seat was comfortable, screen and earphone quality outstanding and the entertainment selection classy which means a lot of arthouse movies and first rate recordings of operas and classical music available. Toilets were clean and roomy - impressed by the mood-lighting. Instead of the usual cold white lighting: warm and red colours which even made the ""necessary"" a pleasant and entertaining experience. Only disappointment was the food: quality, presentation and quantity were nothing to write home about. I had salad and apple-pie dessert but left the main course untouched. There is room for improvement. However on the plus-side drinks-rounds were frequent. Captain announced an early landing at Doha but due to heavy traffic we just got off the plane at the scheduled arrival time. If it were not for the disappointing food and the lack of staff at check-in I would have rated this trip with 10 stars.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-07;" |  I used to regard Qatar Airways as one of the very best airlines in the world. This was based mostly on my journey taken in 2014 from Warsaw to Hanoi via Doha. I was impressed by the quality and standards QA presented then. This is why this year (after traveling with Emirates in 2015) I decided to fly with Qatar Airways to Sri Lanka from Warsaw. Unfortunately this time I was left disappointed. 1) Changing an aircraft - choosing QA I was tempted with advertisements of a brand new Boeing 787 Dreamliner. I chose the connection offering this very plane, but a few months later it was changed for one of the oldest machines used by QA - Airbus 340. 2) On board service - in 2014 every passenger was given a travel set (earplugs, toothbrush etc), during my last flight (which was overnight) no such thing was available. 3) Meals - in 2014 there were two meals served (main dish and a snack) now it's only one. 4) No snacks were available during my QR664 flight (unlike in 2014) 5) Drinks - QR boast about being the one air company offering champagne in economy class. No such thing was available, neither on my first flight from Warsaw to Doha this year, nor during flight from Doha to Colombo. These are not very big problems, but they have left me thinking it was only two years, so many changes and all of them for the worse. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-06-04;"I recently flew Qatar Airways from Dallas Ft Worth to Cape Town via Doha, and returning from Cape Town to London via Doha. Crew was professional, however inconsistent - some happy and some basically stoic. Dallas to Doha was mixed - excellent food, amenities and seats/beds. Service felt a bit robotic. Doha to Cape Town also mixed - food, seat/beds, amenities were great, and the service was partially good, yet some didn't appear happy. Entertainment system did not work for part of the flight, and selections were limited. Doha Airport business lounge is on point. especially in the dining area - sincere and accommodating. Cape Town to Doha at the gate, was horrible - the woman who verified/scanned the boarding pass was so rude, and it unfortunately set the tone for me that day. Flight Director was a great, sincere guy, and asked all Business Class passengers how their experience was, prior to boarding. I shared, and could tell he was concerned by my feedback, and went above and beyond to make certain I had an excellent, on board experience. The 787 is a great product in Business Class, as was the food. DOH to LHR on the A380 -  from check-in at the gate, a separate level for boarding.  This was a positive journey from check-in to arrival at LHR. The attention by the crew was wonderful.

The 16hr ultra-long-haul flight was superb from embarkation to curbside. Qatar Airways shines with the onboard service, meals and wine. Food quality was outstanding and it was great to dine on demand on this super long flight – I ate three times. Service is top notch being professional, prompt and always accommodating. The seats are large and super comfortable, with mattress, soft pillow and blanket. Only downside was I had a window seat so I did have to jump over the legs of fellow seat mate. To me a small price to pay for such a huge bed. Arriving into Doha was seamless with separate customs and immigration that looked more like a lounge than a normal customs area. This trip was definitely 5 stars – the return flight was completely different.";POSITIVE

A 5.30am check-in took over 30mins then once at the lounge, and seated in the restaurant the waiter balked at me for asking for a menu. Basically, told me I can just have two eggs. So I left and headed to the gate. The gate was a free for all including premium customers and was incredibility hot. The agent loudly and aggressively quizzed about my documentation. Customer service at an all-time low. Airborne everything was going wonderfully well until 3 hours into the flight and the meal service had ended. The couple behind me refused to close their windows (Business has 3 per seat) the entire flight, flooding the cabin with light on this 17hr ultra-long-haul flight. After three conversations with the flight attendants they finally managed to get this couple to close their windows four hours out of LA for an hour. As I am light sleeper it meant I didn’t sleep the entire trip.  I would fly them again but just hope this experience doesn’t happen again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-05-30;" |  I was flying from Manchester to Hanoi with just a 55 minute connection in Doha so when they announced there was going to be a 2 hour delay taking off (from Manchester), I realised I would miss my onward flight. Other passengers were not happy to the point that 2 coppers arrived and led a passenger away (just a quiet word did the trick). In the end it was nearly 3 hours late taking off although at least 1 passenger decided not to fly which I think added to the delay as they had to offload her bags. Once in the air, I was pleased I had chosen Qatar Airways as without doubt their economy seat is the most comfortable I have ever travelled in. I think some airlines have the 777-EW as 3-5-3 where as Qatar have gone with 3-4-3 so are less narrow plus these seats also have good lumbar support. Less impressive were the food offerings, I had opted for a vegetarian dish which was very spicy but the FA on seeing that I had not really touched my main, was quick to offer an alternative. I hadn't actually said a word of complaint which amazed me as my usual experience with FAs when travelling economy is that they barely register you exist. On arriving in Doha at around 4am, I was pleasantly surprised how efficient Qatar's ground staff were as they had already booked me a hotel room and issued a new boarding pass. Had to go through immigration which was painless then off to Movenpick Towers and Suites with a 250 Rials credit (about £50) to be used for food. I also had my suitcase sent to the hotel which arrived within 2 hours. This was enough for 2 good meals using room service but was told I could not use the restaurant. (Qatar passengers are banned from using the restaurant on Fridays). Also slightly annoying was that the hotel gave the 250 credit in 3 vouchers (100+75+75) so if I wanted to place a food order for 110, I was told I would have to use 2x75 and not receive a voucher for unused 40 Rials. Anyhow bus picked me up at midnight, took me back to airport and checked in for my Hanoi flight. Think it was a different aircraft as economy was 3x3x3 but seats looked identical and just as comfortable. Flight seemed to go quickly including around 60 minutes stop in BKK. Food offerings were even worse than the Manchester-Doha leg but wasn't too bothered as wasn't really hungry anyhow. Hanoi arrival was very smooth into what looks like a brand new terminal. At the price I paid for my ticket, I will definitely fly with Qatar again and if flying from Manchester, eat at the pub on the perimeter road before checking in.";POSITIVE

The inflight entertainment in this particular aircraft was a bit dated, but worked nonetheless. Transfer in Doha was quick, no queuing in the security check. The A350-900 was a bit more comfortable than the B787, and the inflight entertainment was newer in this aircraft. WiFi was not free, and the price was very high, which is a big minus.

No information was given about a change of the aircraft : instead of the A350 we got the B787. instead of the confirmed seat in the middle section of business class, the new seat is in the noisy last row! At check-in I was told that the luggage will be tagged only to the last destination of Qatar flights which was Sydney.

Dining at the Business Class lounge at Hamad International was excellent. After lunch, chose a quiet room to rest little as there was six hours in transit for my onward flight. In the quiet room I could not rest due to heavy ""snoring"" from the next quiet room. So I took a tour around inside the new airport. I reported to Gate 8 one hour before my connecting flight to Kochi and noticed that the flight to Kochi will be full.  I will give a thumbs down for their service from Doha to Kochi. A330-300 was old but clean, amenity kit provided in the Business Class was really nothing on this short 4hr 25mins flight.  Crew were rushing which caused spilling two glasses of Orange Juice on a lady who was sitting next to me.  Seat comfort and IFE were good. Looking forward for my return flight in June 2016.";POSITIVE

I was informed that there are no 'mattresses' and quilts on this flight as it is under 8 hours duration. The FA told me it is a flight duration of 7h50m. The QR website and my electronic itinerary, sent to me by QR, shows the flight as 8h30m. For a flight that leaves DOH at nearly 3am, one would expect that in a business class that has lie-flat seats that QR would have proper bedding, same as on all flights to/from the US, Australia, S. Africa, etc. The FA working my side of the aircraft in the second cabin of business class was cold and generally unfriendly - unusual for QR where the FAs are usually very personable and obliging. She more or less tossed everything at me and had a hard time cracking a smile before marching back to the galley. If you fly in business class with QR to China, bring your own bedding!";POSITIVE

Flight departed on time from Gates D - please be aware that the D gates are a long walk from the lounge - the terminal shuttle train is not yet running. Aircraft configured 2-2-2 and we took 2 together by the window and aisle. The seats are fully lie flat, but the foot space is a little small. The seats in row one seemed to have a larger foot rest area. The inflight entertainment had a lot less choice than on the Boeing 787. No wifi on this plane. The dining experience was the same as on my previous report from Manchester to Doha but the menu was different. As the flight departed at 2.30am, we chose a light meal and then had something more substantial near the end of the flight. On demand dining allowed you to chose what you want and when you have it. Flight landed early and disembarking speedy with business class being allowed off first.";POSITIVE

Cabin crew introduced themselves and brought champagne before take off. This flight has a dine on demand service. The crew took my order for lunch and drinks prior to take off. They asked when I wanted it - I said probably later as we had just had breakfast at the airport. They asked me to give them a 15 minute notice on when I wanted the food. Champagne and nuts served after take off. Lunch was soup, followed by an arabic meze. Main course was a spicy chicken dish and finally some ice cream. I declined the cheese course. Great choice of wines, Seating extremely comfortable and versatile. I managed some good quality sleep in the recline mode. The better cabin air atmosphere on the 787 was noticeable. Good selection of inflight entertainment although it took a little while to get used to the remote handset. Interactive flight display but no tail or belly cam. I used the wifi which was seemed to be free for only 15 minutes - easy to log on - and I managed to zap out a couple of emails. On time arrival. The crew allowed all the business class passengers to leave the plane first. Priority lanes at Doha directed us to an arrival lounge where we stopped for comfort break (you could also get refreshments here) then visa on arrival and immigration were at the exit from this lounge. Baggage arrived at the same time as I got to the reclaim belt. I could not fault Qatar Airways in anyway.";POSITIVE

I only found out when I downloaded their iphone app they have rebooked me on a Doha-Sydney flight. I rang them to ask what has happened and they say the Doha-Auckland flight has been cancelled so I will have to travel to Sydney and pay for the Sydney-Auckland flight. On online forums I can see they have offered free replacement flights to other customers but are now refusing to do this any more. This is against EU aviation law EC261 which states Qatar are liable for rerouting costs when they choose to cancel flights. It also goes against what it states in their own terms and conditions.  They are telling me I will have to pay £2000+ to book alternative flights. I have already booked non-refundable connecting flights on other airlines so this decision by Qatar Airways is going to cost me thousands of pounds unless they change their minds. They couldn't care less for their own customers.;NEGATIVE

In May 2016, we found out that the flights were canceled, allegedly because the route was cancelled due to delivery difficulties of the A350, and thus the Boeing 777-200LR is used on other routes. The German/Polish Qatar Airways Call Center offered generous manner, either to refund our ticket, or to move the trip to February, which is not possible, however, because the lodges are already booked for the tour in New Zealand, and not may be canceled. A flight to Sydney and then a connecting flight to Auckland was declined by Qatar Airways, because obviously the One World partner Qantas no longer operates since 17/05/2016 with Qatar together. Thus, Qatar Airways does not even follow its own conditions of carriage and does not substitute transportation! Such poor service I have not yet seen. ";NEGATIVE

When we boarded, we exchanged the seats, but their allotment of seats was so poor. The flight got delayed for 5 hours due to technical problem and by the time we reached Doha we had missed our connecting flight to Hyderabad. They said we will get Hotel and will be on next flight to Hyderabad. Once we reached Doha Qatar things got changed. They informed me that people who missed Hyderabad Flight will be accommodated on Emirates via Dubai and there were only 2 seats available. We are 4 in a family, luckily my wife was having visa for Qatar. I was forced to leave my wife and kids in Qatar and fly to Hyderabad. Her transfer was handled by the Qatar Airways and promised all 4 Bags will be delivered in Hyderabad. Emirates delivered 2 Bags at my residence, but told us to contact Qatar Airways about the 2 others. Now, after 12 days I am getting the run around.

A comfortable plane for long haul flights. Good leg room (and I'm a big guy). Entertainment system was good - plenty of new and old movies to choose from as well as other entertainment. As good as any I've seen (including Emirates). The food was mixed. Return flights were better than outbound and breakfast seemed to be the least favorite. But some great tasting dinners were served for economy class. Service was generally good, but better on return flights. Overall, relaxed, friendly and efficient. Doha airport was a pain due to the transit security screening (which seems pointless), but the airport itself was good. Strangely, I'd like to recommend the Burger King there. Generally found that the Boeing planes were more comfortable than Airbus. Cushioning and leg room were much better on the former. Really liked the amenities packages given on the long haul flights as well.";POSITIVE

Boeing 787 DOH-CPH was not much better. The food was nothing to write home about with very small portions. However the crew and the service was fantastic on all segments. Transfer in Doha was really smooth and Hamad seemed to be a great airport. My suitcase was broken when arrived to Copenhagen and no compensation  was offered.

Aircraft was clean and spacious with 2-2-2 seat configuration in business class, but the seat was not comfy. You could lie flat but lower part of the seat dropped down and legs did not get enough support. I could not sleep well in this seat. FA staff on PVG-DOH flight professional and helpful while DOH-LHR were superb. Food on PVG-DOH looked pretty good but tasted dull. On DOH-LHR, I ordered a light salad with scallops but got octopus served. Transit security check at DOH was messy : no Fast Track at all even though Fast Track was clearly signed.

Checked in luggage was handled correct and arrived perfectly though transferred twice on the way. All 3 aircrafts tried were in good conditions. FA staff did their level best to please me in the sky though the flights were full and the levels of food and beverage qualities continue to decline a bit. Flight entertainment was more than sufficient. Poor headphones. Amenity kit provided. The space in 787 in economy class is disastrous: the distance from nose-tip to screen of monitor is hardly 20 cm when the seat in front is declined. The bus transfers in Doha continue for many flights (e.g. DOH-CPH) and are very annoying to a 5-star airline. Ticket was not expensive as bought under world campaign 5 months earlier.";POSITIVE

In Sydney the organisation was haphazard and slow, it took ages to get to a counter. The trip itself was fine - we got a two seater which gave us some more wriggle room - what was disappointing was the relative poor selection of movies available - on a 14 hour flight I found one to watch. Service was fine, I chose to forgo dinner as it was too late and breakfast (nothing appealing). Transit through Doha was relatively straightforward and the airport is well appointed. Doha to Rome was ok - no major issues although paradoxically we had a greater range of movies for the relatively shorter flight (5 hours). Later in April the flight was reversed - check in at Rome was relatively quick and certainly more efficient than Sydney - flight was fine. We had a couple of days stopover in Doha which was interesting. The flight back was good - check in was very smooth and time to check out the airport was welcomed.";POSITIVE

Love the big windows but legroom is surprisingly tight and the configuration of 3-3-3 really makes this aircraft look quite cramped and the aisle is also narrow. Despite this, the service given by the crew is excellent, received 2 meals for this 8 hour flight, a supper and breakfast while during the course of this red eye flight, the FA's are constantly going round the cabin offering drinks. Second flight on an old Airbus 330, with much better legroom. IFE is also the older type and a bit hard to control via the seat controller as it was not a touch screen. Service is also good from friendly cabin crews and arrived in Istanbul on time. Qatar Airways offer a good price on their long haul route and will fly them again but they really have to improve on their legroom especially on the 787 and they also converting their 777 from 3-3-3 to more cramped seating of 3-4-3.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-05-08;" |  Paris to Goa via Doha on 2nd May. Departure/Arrival is from our local airport and food free baggage allowance. Poor service by crew on board and the meal service was below expectations, the portion size left me still hungry.  I tried to get the attention of the stewardess to ask for more bread each time she walked past, but was ignored being too far away in my window seat. This, in spite of the fact that my call light was on for well over 45 minutes. Finally managed to ask for bread when they came to collect the trays! The service takes a long time in coming and when it does, they serve the drinks and meals in a single pass and don't come back to ask if you'd like your drink refreshed. Surely they can manage to serve an aperitif first so that passengers can relax while waiting for crew to get the meals ready. For the quick snack before landing we were served a puff pastry roll with some spicy chicken filling. The filling was okay, the pastry, terrible. The standard 3x3x3 seat configuration means that window seat passengers are 2 seats away from the aisle. As a result I was forced to remain in my seat without visiting the rest room for hours as I did not wish to inconvenience the passengers seated beside me until one decided to take a walk, himself. The reason we have so far continued to fly with Qatar Airways is the convenience of flying direct to our end destination without necessitating an overnight hotel stay. ";NEGATIVE

Toilets had very good amenities and ambience. The best part of the flight was the service onboard. The crew was extremely nice and helpful, and the cabin manager stood out the most in my opinion.

qatar-airways;2016-05-07;" |  Philadelphia to Doha, and more complete disregard for Privilege Club Platinum members. Originated travel with American Airlines in Washington, ending in Kuwait with Qatar Airways via DOH. Bad weather in PHL led to a ground stop in DCA, delaying departure by about 45 minutes. I eventually arrived in PHL with a full hour before departure of QR728 to DOH. I was concerned about my one piece of checked luggage making the connection from AA to QR in PHL. I was assured at the gate that all luggage had been loaded. Then the gate supervisor boarded the aircraft to inform me that my luggage had not, in fact, been transferred from AA to QR. I thought of deplaning, but as assured that it would be put on another QR flight that evening from JFK, BOS, MIA, IAD or ORD. PHL is only one of two QR flights from the US that departs in the morning. QR had a good 10 hours to figure out how to get my bag to another US departure city for a QR flight to DOH that evening. On arrival in DOH, no one was there to greet me on disembarkation to provide me any information, despite being a platinum member of Privilege Club and a very frequent flyer with a lucrative corporate account. At the first class lounge in DOH prior to my onward flight to KWI, I asked about my bag. The system showed no information. The agent at the reception said she’d phone around to find out where it is. A few minutes later, she located me in the lounge to inform me that my bag was still sitting in PHL and would travel tomorrow on QR728, a full 24 hours later. QR had ample time to get my bag to another US city for a departure on a QR flight to DOH that same evening. I am annoyed and feel that Qatar Airways did not handle this properly and risks losing their high yield customers if this is how they manage things. To add insult to injury, from the first class lounge to gate D1 for the KWI flight is a long walk and one would think that there would be buggies available at the exit from the first class lounge to transport first class passengers to remote gates. Despite assurances in DOH that someone would greet me on arrival in KWI, of course, there was no one there. I waited for nearly an hour in the airport QR office for the staff to come after seeing off the flight that I came in on.";POSITIVE

Clean comfortable passenger cabins with some of the best leg-room and seat-room I've experienced in tourist class, plus decent food and drinks, and very friendly and responsive staff who really proved their mettle on the last of the four flights I took (Doha - Washington Dulles). It was a full flight with many elderly passengers (apparently travelling as a group), some two dozen of whom required wheelchairs, and departure was delayed somewhat, but through boarding and the flight itself the cabin crew proved more than equal to the challenge, with requests handled quickly (even a couple of toilet-roll-outage situations were remedied promptly once passengers made crew members aware of them) and a friendly, congenial air retained throughout.

Breakfast very basic served at about 3am Doha time. On the return 02.55am out of Doha, full Dinner is again served then a mediocre breakfast just before arrival at 4pm. As to the planes, both types were very good, although I found the foot space a little tight on both planes (window Seat). The crew however were excellent and the flights were good.

Days before my flight I got the opportunity to upgrade, which I did as I had money to spare and for a long haul I thought this would be perfect. Dressed in a t-shirt, joggers and trainers upon entering the aircraft and presenting my ticket for business class I got a look of disgust - almost as though I didn't and should have been there. How dare someone dressed for eight months worth of travelling be seated in business class right? Offended to say the least. The seats and food was wonderful. Everything you expect from a good airline like Qatar Airways and for business class. It was my first time flying business so I was definitely enjoying it despite the look I received when I arrived onboard. I decided to ignore this although it gets worse. Everybody in the entire cabin got the best of service. Not me! It's almost like they were deliberately not willing to serve me a drink or food etc. I found this service pretty shocking. 11 hours on a plane and served two drinks? Disgusted. I hate complaining and causing drama but personally this goes to show people judge you. I had the money to spend on my flight and therefore I should have received the same service as everyone else in that cabin. I'm pretty let down as this was my first time with Qatar Airways. You should never judge someone by the clothes they're wearing or lack of make up etc. So I didn't look like a business class flyer but I'm a nice person who wanted to enjoy me flight and ended up feeling tense thanks to the staff onboard my flight. Will make me think twice about upgrading with them or even flying with them. Next time I'll stick with economy class where aparently I belong.

The aircraft started moving from the stand and they were all still standing and talking, and the attendant did not say a word to them, even though they were right next to them.  Qatar Airways need to overhaul the control and the content of their entertainment system, it is annoying for being extra sensitive and films were old. It is a global airline and most of us do not mind watching a kiss.  Food was sensational and service impeccable, apart from the FA in the lounge who could not care less. I went there for a drink to escape the noisy and demanding family taking up the entire from row of business, but she was not welcoming and ignored me completely. After 10 minutes I gave up.

We were informed we would need to pay a very large sum of money to move to the next flight although we are premium and the class ticket was the exact same. It was this or cancel the holiday and pay for a flight back to Dubai until then they refused to release our bags - we paid the large amount and paid for hotels. On the return leg I requested the cabin crew to make the bed, I had my phone charging in the side panel. I slept and on awaking I went to take my phone to find it down the side of the bed. To my horror it was crushed to peices, I can only assume that when making the bed it was moved and the seat moved to create the bed so crushing it, the seat was not moved in any way before or after. CSD apologised prefusily, gave me her bosses email. Arrived in Doha, and connection missed to DWC as flight was late and parked on remote stand, told another 8 hours wait. I am told not their fault, well whose is it then? I followed up these issues with emails and received two emails from a customer care rep saying we are sorry blah blah, no offer to replace the phone at least, it is not their fault, no offer to look into fight connections issues, no reply from any of the exec team. I will never set foot on them again. The customer care is appaling and reply with copy and paste answers so do not waste your time. In the air fantastic, on the ground words escape me. ";NEGATIVE

After taking off it was meal time, and I was given the option of eating on awakening. The seat was comfortable, and the breakfast was good though the congee that I took as Main is not Chinese style. Throughout the flight and service are smooth and comfortable. And this after relaxing at the beautiful lounge at Doha airport. A first class flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-04-11;" |  I've flown Qatar Airways several times before and always loved the in-flight service and the food. However, never before did anything go wrong. Business class trip to Oman, and on departure from Heathrow they held the plane for an hour and a half for late arriving passengers (so announced the pilot to the passengers). Didn't make any time up in the air, and on landing at Doha it meant half the plane missed our connections, including me, which meant being stranded in Qatar for a night. Qatar Airways insisted I stay in the airline-owned hotel a shuttle bus ride away from the airport, despite my request to stay in the airport hotel. I got no sleep due to the noise and 4am wake up call, and they charged me USD$21 for an hour of Internet access. Missed my morning of meetings in Oman due to the rescheduled flight. The shocking thing is that on return no one cared an ounce about the fact their decision to hold the plane in London - not weather or mechanical. I asked for compensation for the $21 I had to spend on their hotel's Internet and was refused. True customer service shows through when things go badly and Qatar failed in this case. In short, inflight service is definitely one of the best airlines in the world. But if anything goes wrong with your trip, you do not want to be flying Qatar.";NEGATIVE

Love flying on the A380, lots of room and very quiet in the cabin. IFE again more modern and similar to the Boeing 777. Last sector DOH to MAN again on A330, same as the outward leg.

Throughout the flight the crew and managers couldn't have been more thoughtful and caring for my needs, they ensured I was hydrated and continually checked on me. When the crew changed over, the manager ensured a handover was completed with the next crew to look after me on the next long flight to Doha.

qatar-airways;2016-04-09;"My husband and I were flying Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Durban King Shaka via Doha for the first time since moving to England. We had booked through a travel agent. On March 24 we left with adequate time to get to the airport. Unfortunately, due to the tube strike, traffic on London roads was manic. Needless to say we arrived at the airport when check-in had closed and was informed that we could not board our flight. Our travel agent was unreachable to find an alternate flight and all other airlines were closed or not going to Doha where we were to make our connecting flight. Our hearts sank, thinking that we would not get to reunite with our family for Easter. Then my husband received a call from Qatar Airways help desk where one of the staff who had heard our case somehow found a way to get us onto the flight. She went beyond her duty to help us and for that we are grateful. We will definitely fly Qatar again. The rest of the trip including the return went off hitch free.";POSITIVE

Cabin service was impeccable and food good. Happy to see that Qatar Airways maintains inflight catering standards. Transfer in Doha was swift. Second sector operated by a A330-200. Comments similar to first flight. Fast disembarkation in Rome. Return check in at Rome was good friendly and fast. Lounge used by QR in Rome leaves a lot to be desired. Boarding on time with early departure. Flight was operated by a Boeing 787, and the IFE on B787 is excellent. Cabin crew were charming and professional. Food and drink excellent. Early arrival into DOH giving good connection time in DOH. Doha business class lounge outstanding - clean and crisp. Last sector to CMB was again on an A340-600.

qatar-airways;2016-04-08;" |  We were due to travel from Cape Town to Brussels and I phoned Qatar Airways office three days before our departure to ask if Brussels airport was still closed after the bombings. I was told that it would be open but I asked what would happen if it was not open and I was informed that passengers would be put on flights to Amsterdam, Paris or Dusseldorf. I therefore printed off our boarding passes to Brussels two days before the flight as requested. When we arrived at Cape Town airport 3.5 hours before the flight, we were told that our flights had been cancelled and we would have to rebook. At the booking office, we were told that there were no seats available on flights to Amsterdam, Paris, Dusseldorf or London Heathrow and all they could offer us were flights to Birmingham. If Qatar had sent us an email to inform us that our flights had been cancelled, we might have been able to find much more suitable alternatives in time. We accepted very reluctantly to fly to Birmingham, as this was extremely inconvenient, only to be told that the airline would not organise or pay for onward travel from Birmingham to Brussels. We also faced a wait of 7 hours at Doha airport instead of the previously scheduled 2 hours. We asked if there was a possibility of an upgrade or a place in the Business lounge but we were told that it was not company policy. At Doha airport, we tried to book train tickets from Birmingham to London and from London to Brussels on the Eurostar but there were no printing facilities we could find. It was also cold and extremely noisy, with the children's play area right next to the quiet room .Our train tickets cost us £33 each and Eurostar tickets 382 euros, out of our own pocket. We finally arrived at Birmingham airport to discover there were no trains that day to London, due to overhead cables being down. We finally arrived in Brussels at 11.30pm, having been due to arrive originally at 7.25am. An email of complaint to Qatar Airways was met with the inflexibility we had encountered from the supervisor at Cape Town airport. This was the first time we had travelled with this airline and it will be the last.";NEGATIVE

This family also had a child, that was screaming for nine hours. The child is not to blame - the parents did not pack single toy or drawing book etc.  Original ticket had a layover in Doha of more than 8 hours that with complimentary hotel. Qatar changed the times which resulted in the cancellation of this hotel booking. I was assured by there are ample sleeping opportunities in the Business lounge in Doha but do not bet on this. Lounge was cold and too noisy for sleeping. Quiet zone was occupied  so you are waiting there for your next flight until the next morning. Next shorter flight in bad business seat in A320 and I could not sleep properly. Will not book again if they have a layover of less than 8 hours.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-04-05;"I've used Qatar Airways in a mix of classes 10 times over the past year and I have to say in my opinion they are one of the best airlines at the moment. Check in LHR T4 quick and polite used the lounge (Skyteam) through my frequent flier status. Economy on the first flight seat 31A on the upper deck of the A380 comfortable seat with good AVOD departed on time. Service good with lunch and a snack served by a cheerful crew. Connection at DOH very good boarding on to a new looking Boeing 787 business class seat 4E which was very comfortable. Despite an early morning departure dinner served which was pretty good, I slept for 6 hours waking up to a cooked breakfast 2 hours out of CPT. Arrived a little late but bags off quick a great flight. Return CPT-DOH-LHR check in quick and polite, offered an exit seat which was nice, the Boeing 787 in economy is a little tight but I don't mind being small - the seat is also a little hard but otherwise a very nice aircraft food and service on this flight very good for economy. Connecting in DOH onto another A380 and again seat 31A upper deck. Early 03:30am departure so skipped food, although drinks offered through the flight - I slept 4 hours waking up for a cooked breakfast which was okay.

qatar-airways;2016-03-29;"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Amsterdam - Doha leg was the Boeing 787-800. Fortunatly the ground staff at Amsterdam Airport assigned me to an exit row seat, which gave me more legroom. This worked out well for me, since the normal seats on the B787 are too small and only have 31 inch pitch.  Avoid the Boeing 787 at all costs. On arrival in Doha we were transported by busses to the terminal and welcomed by a long queue for a security check. It took quite some time as they had only 2 or 3 stations open, with several international flights arriving at the same time. With the new departure time from Amsterdam (18.15 instead of 14.40) you may have only minutes to transfer (depending where you're flying next of course) and that might turn out to be too short. Hamad Airport wasn't quite what I had hoped for. One positive note. Doha is not as busy as Dubai. Doha to Bangkok was on the fantastic A380. This flight was very good and I was lucky again and given a seat on the upper deck economy section (seat 25b). The seat was in front of the bulkhead and offered me extra legroom ones again. Smooth flight (or rather a nice inflight sleep). The return flight from Bangkok to Doha was an A380 again and was uneventfull. At Suvarnabhumi it took the ground staff quite some time to realise that their check at boarding wasn't going to work with only 1 staff member checking passports and boarding cards. After some time another staff member came and checks went quicker and the flight could depart on time. On arrival in Doha no security check, off the airplane into the terminal. The flight from Doha to Amsterdam was now on a new Boeing 777 with 10 seat abreast. Still not bad and I was happy I didn't have to sit on that awful 787. Nice flight and another fine crew. On all flights the crew was nice, and they worked hard, always smiling, always happy to help.  Transfer time in Doha only 50 minutes, which is a recipe for disaster and that is a dealbreaker for me.

I loved my experience with them and I would definately fly them again.";POSITIVE

From ground to air, they are streets ahead of most airlines. The 1-2-1 seating on the Boeing 787 is amazing, comfortable and provides an intimate and private space on a long flight - even the 2-2-2 seating on the Boeing 777 was a very respectable product. The catering is fantastic, on all flights the quality was high and beautifully presented. The Barramundi in Saffron sauce I was served on the way back from Melbourne, was something I would be very happy with at a high end restaurant! There biggest asset is their staff who provide consistent and warm hospitality. I was greeted by name on boarding on several flights, including with 'salaam' which was a nice touch. The lounge staff were friendly without being overbearing and the guy manning the showers outbound deserves a massive pat on the back as he went out of his way to ensure I had everything I needed to get refreshed. Outbound on my flight DOH-MEL I was unwell so unfortunately didn't get to enjoy the catering (which looked amazing from the menu) or bar but was well looked after by staff onboard the flight including the CSD who checked up on me throughout the flight. Inbound on the last leg to CPH, my seat area hadn't been cleaned properly due to late landing and turnaround of the plane. This was unacceptable but once crew was informed she was embarrassed and tried her best to rectify the problem and tried to more make up for it through the rest of the flight.  All in all the soft service is really what sets QR apart from their rivals.";POSITIVE

Dubai to Doha flight delayed due to weather which is fair enough, cabin crew and supervisor reassured us that the Captain had called and we'd land 20 mins before departure so would be whisked to our flight to Edinburgh - however no staff were waiting, and the connections desk told us the gate was closed. Some hours later (after being re-routed via London) our London flight was delayed for over an hour to await connecting passengers, so we were likely to miss the London to Edinburgh connection arranged on British Airways - no ground staff waiting on arrival for us there despite promises. The British Airways flight was delayed due to technical fault so we arrived 12 hours late with no luggage  - missed my wife's surprise party and champagne breakfast the next morning as I had to get up early to go and collect luggage from the airport.

A lot of correspondence before departure due to special needs (wheelchair passenger, and bringing ashes of a deceased).

Qatar Airways uses Boeing 777 to Australia so good for couples. If you travel alone you should take a seat in the middle row to have direct access to aisle. The business class product of Qatar Airways is different depending on the aircraft. ;POSITIVE

There was one size of pyjama left and that was XL. As I was sitting in seat 2B it was difficult to understand why these shortages occurred. Whilst the flight left at 3am and arrived at 9pm, window blinds were closed and it was treated as if it was a night flight which meant you had to buzz if you wanted anything. I have flown Qatar Business quite a few times and this flight was not at the same level of the previous flights. Our connecting flight out of Doha had champagne but it was warm.";NEGATIVE

Storage for hand luggage is limited when you travel with carry-on only, passengers seating in the middle row put theirs in your compartment as well. The food is really excellent (some of the dishes came close to food quality on Swiss First!) The crew were young and very different from one flight to the other, but in general friendly and efficient. I reckon Qatar Airways crew is better in most ways then their competitors from the Middle East.

As for the in-seat entertainment although there is a good choice of stuff to watch, the screens use a touch-screen control which doesn't seem very sensitive, meaning you get people tapping the back of your seat with a great deal of force  - not great if you want to sleep.

If there was any downside it was the Boeing 787 - after the space of the A380 it felt noisy, the blinds didn't keep the setting sun out, and something of a throwback to narrow bodied longhaul aircraft but without the romance - I am old enough to remember 707s and the DC8s.

Brand new Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300ER on the MCT-DOH leg and an elderly A330-200 between Doha and Ho Chi Minh City. The 777 seats are just fabulous! The A330 was equipped with the older seats which stretch out fully but stay slightly inclined. I was a bit disappointed at first but then noticed that the angle was not to bad. I could sleep very well without sliding down. Food and beverages were of excellent quality throughout, including in the new very large business lounge in DOH. The cabin crew was friendly, always available and helpful but never obtrusive. Check-in swift both in MCT and SGN. I would fly Qatar Airways again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-14;"London to Colombo via Doha with Qatar Airways, the first leg was on a Boeing 787, my first experience of this aircraft. The noise in the rear economy cabin was incredible and we were moved forward to the next cabin. This was better but noisier than say a 777. Food on this leg was poor and although the wine was of good quality, it was dispensed in horrible cups. The other 3 legs were much better. The A340 is a comfortable plane and the A380 can't be beaten.  My overall impression was I was in economy and should not be allowed to forget it. Doha is a far better airport than Dubai.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-11;"Flew Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha. First time aboard the A380, and what a product. Check-in at LHR was a bit of a drag unfortunately. IFE is particularly good on board with plenty to choose from to fill a long flight. Good standard of food and drink during the flight all served by very pleasant crew. Hamad International is like a breath of fresh air after the nightmare of the old Doha International Airport. If you have a long layover, would recommend the airport hotel. All in all, another very pleasant trip with QR, cannot recommend enough.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-10;"Doha to Philadelphia with Qatar Airways. Excellent service, and a beautiful business class lounge in Doha Airport. From the moment you board the plane, a glass of pink champagne served, and excellent food - with dining anytime you choose. Top rated movies on the inflight entertainment systems. I now understand why Qatar Airways has been ranked number one for so many years.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-09;"Mumbai to Dallas Ft Worth via Doha with Qatar Airways in business class. This must be one of the top airlines in the world. Food and drinks are at restaurant standard.

qatar-airways;2016-02-09;"Riyadh to Lahore via Doha with Qatar Airways, and it is a good airline. Staff is very friendly as well as cooperative. Aircraft are in good condition and there IFE system is up to date. Seats on A350 from Riyadh to Doha was very good but for Doha to Lahore they had A330 with seats like an average 4 star airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-09;"Manchester to Cape Town via Doha with Qatar Airways. The flight was smooth but the outward journey became rather uncomfortable due to lack of space. The person in front of me reclined their seat which made it worse. My TV screen became far too close. Doha to Manchester journey was much better as the plane was older. There was more space and seats were more comfortable. The food and drinks service was limited. We needed more water, juice, or even a glass of wine. We were given a small amount with our meal but not enough. The meals were nearly all the same. too much chicken and poor vegetarian option.  Some of the food was poor. The film selection was okay. I would want to travel business class if I were to use Qatar Airways again. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-08;"Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha on the Boeing 787. The service and food was very good as always in Qatar Airways, but the Boeing 787 was very cramped for a long houl aircraft. The seat was uncomfortable and the window shades was often regulated by the cabin staff. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-07;"Singapore to Paris via Doha, and Qatar Airways has the reputation for being the best five star airline in the world. Especially their A350's are outstanding.

Thanks to Qatar Airways for unforgettable journey.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-04;"We flew Qatar Airways from Madrid to Doha on a Boeing 787 and onto Bangkok on the A380, and return. All 4 flights on time and check-in procedures quick and efficient. Onboard the service was very good and seats comfortable and easy to control. I enjoyed the meals I chose and had no problem obtaining my first choices on any of the flights, although on the second leg on both flights I only wanted breakfast. However, my husband was disappointed the vegetarian meals he had pre-ordered. Onboard the staff didn't acknowledge he had ordered a special meal, he was just handed the standard business class menu and had to point out his pre-order to the attendant. If a special meal is ordered it seems only the main course is changed. He had to have the Arabian mezze as a starter. The first vegetarian main course he was served (Madrid-Doha) was a disaster. It was described as Asian vegetarian  and was just vegetables and rice and had to be sent back for reheating. On the return journey he abandoned special meal orders and chose the vegetarian option from the main menu instead which were much better. Lounges at Madrid, Bangkok and especially Doha were good, and I was able to take a shower in the very nice private bathrooms in the Al Mourjan lounge in both directions, much appreciated to freshen up between flights.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-02;"I recently flew Qatar Airways from London to Bangkok via Doha, returning from Ho Chi Minh City. Around 1.5 hours into your journey you get the meal service. This wasn't preceded with a drinks service, the drink was served with the meal, and service was incredibly slow. After the trays were collected, cabin lights are dimmed, and turned back on two hours before landing where you are given a snack (on the 6 hour leg from LHR to DOH this meant no more than two hours between meals). The snack is cleared but there was still 1.5 hours of the flight remaining - this second service could take place a little later into the flight. Cabin staff should bring a tray of drinks around occasionally but on my flight having a chat in the galley seemed to take priority. If laptops should be turned off during landing / take off the staff should enforce this rule, not just leave it as they do the cabin check. Blankets and headsets should be collected before landing in my opinion. I have recommended this airline but it was a border line decision (swayed by good prices and on time performance).";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-01;"Bangkok to Edinburgh via Doha, after a disappointing outward flight, Qatar Airways service on the return leg was much improved. They still were out of champagne on the Bangkok to Doha leg (rose only) but the food and service were great. Being my first time on an A380 with bar, after dinner we spent a short time there and the staff were absolutely delightful (and they found some white Krug champagne too). The space on both the A380 and Boeing 787 was almost identical and very comfortable. My only gripe is that on the morning flight from Doha to Edinburgh we were hungry and had breakfast shortly after take off on a 7.5 hour flight. By 5 hours into the flight all we had been offered was drinks, tea and coffee. After mentioning I was peckish, I was given a packet of chocolate cookies. About an hour out of Edinburgh, the cabin crew discreetly asked the few passengers who looked hungry if they wanted a snack and brought out some bits and pieces (I had ravioli and someone else a cheeseboard). I got the feeling this was leftovers rather than an actual snack service since they kept running out of dishes and not everyone received something. Maybe a little self-help sandwich bar would work on this flight?";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-01;"Edinburgh to Doha. Plenty space, comfortable seats and smooth flight. Service was poor though. Only 24 Business seats yet ran out of champagne before take off, ran out of soup, cold starter, and cheese board - suggested I take crackers and share with the person next to me. Then ran out of NZ Sauvignon Blanc and offered dessert wine instead. Made a formal complaint but I'm still waiting for a response.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-02-01;Qatar Airways flight from Doha to Edinburgh arrived on time and the service provided by the cabin crew was superb. The entertainment system and food was also excellent. The only problem - the seating configuration is too cramped and uncomfortable especially on a 8 hour flight. All in all a good flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-31;"Flew from Manchester to Goa via Doha with Qatar Airways. Check in very good, fast and efficient, fast tracked through security then to the lounge in Manchester. Boarding very quick and flight on time, first leg on an A330, the seats very comfortable and fully flat. FA very nice and efficient, landed in Doha ahead of time. Went straight to Qatar Airways business class lounge, in my opinion better than some top hotels I have stopped in (wish we had had a longer stopover). Then to goa via A320, again FA very nice and efficient, this aircraft very small seats not very comfortable only recline so far (a 3hr flight). Landed in Goa ahead of time again, return journey on A320 again to Doha, slight delay on leaving Goa so didn't have time to visit lounge in Doha. Boeing 787 this time to Manchester, what a plane in business class 1x2x1 configuration seats very comfortable, service once again very good, FA a credit to the airline. I didn't sample any food as I slept for 6hrs of the 7hr flight. I will definitely be flying again with Qatar Airways, hopefully they will sort a different plane from Doha to Goa.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-28;"London to Dhaka via Doha with Qatar Airways. It was a good experience although I didn't like the food. The seating was comfortable and we were supplied blankets, pillows and an amenity kit. The inflight entertainment was okay and the cabin staff were friendly and smiled a lot. When we landed in Doha it was fine and we transferred and had no delay. Overall I would recommend this airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-24;"Ho Chi Minh City to Doha on Qatar Airways. Ground services relatively efficient, the SGN lounge was full, limited selection of food and beverages. Nice clean aircraft, new seat design recently installed - comfortable and roomy with good IFE. Catering on board was disappointing, chosen entrée and dessert were unavailable - I was offered captain's meal instead but declined. Service chaotic, then all meal choices suddenly available 2 hours into flight. Champagne available on tarmac, ordered more for post takeoff only to be told later that there was no champagne available for the flight, several wines also out of stock. This was the most chaotic food and beverage service seen on a Qatar flight, staff were largely indifferent. Wine list on the route appears to have been downgraded since early 2015 and amenity kit appears to be shrinking. Otherwise the flight was non-eventful, arrived Doha to a bus disembarkation for a full A330 which was not enjoyable.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-19;"Inflight, Qatar Airways are fine, with good IFE, food and service. However, when things go wrong it was different. The BKK-DOH flight was ready to leave when they decided to take 2 people off (no idea why) and whilst their luggage was being removed the gurney hit the side of the plane and caused some damage. Not the fault of the airline, this stuff happens.  After 2+ hours on the plane with no information we disembarked. After getting breakfast, I noticed there was a new gate on the departures board. Arriving at the gate, there were around 300 people crowded round a desk with 2 computers and 5 staff, who were apparently trying to get people on different flights. After 3 hours without any discernable progress someone came and told us to move to a lounge. Staff disappeared for 5 hours. Eventually we were told we were moving to a hotel. Having been rushed through customs, our guide ran off leaving me to go downstairs to the Qatar office to find the bus. We were given contradictory information or none at all and the management of the problem was lamentable. Eventually got on a KLM flight 36 hours later (having been told the previous evening that they couldn't book me on another airline). A dreaful experience and I would be reluctant to fly with them again.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-17;"Doha to Dubai and I was upgraded to First Class as the flight was fully booked, and I have a gold card of Qatar Airways.

qatar-airways;2016-01-17;"Perth to London via Doha with Qatar Airways, and cannot fault them. It was a great experience to fly with them.

Don't have anything bad to say about our experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-14;"Venice to Seoul via Doha and my first flight with Qatar Airways, and I was nicely surprised by the airline. Everything was great although the flight was super full! New plane, clean, great inflight entertainment and nice cabin staff. I've also appreciated that they give you a beauty case and socks for the travel. The layover in Doha was very good, in fact the airport is new and full of shops and restaurants. Qatar Airways is totally recommended.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-13;"Qatar Airways, São Paulo to Singapore with a connection in Doha. Check in at GRU Airport very fast and efficient. Business class is very comfortable, colors of the cabin are agreable. Seat reclines 180' and turns into a real bed. Meals are served in your own time and you can pick up 1 appetizer from 1 menu, 1 main course from 2nd menu and a dessert from 3rd menu. Cabin service is friendly. Duvet/blanket and pyjamas offered. will definitely fly again with Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-13;Returning from Doha to Amsterdam on a trip to Thailand with Qatar Airways on the Boeing 787-800. Cabin layout is 3x3x3 which is ok. Cabin was clean and the crew was great. I think that the cabin crew are the greatest asset of Qatar Airways. Flight departed on time and arrived ahead of the scheduled arrival time. Only minor points are the dull snack that is served and that the entertainment system is not as good as on the A380.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-13;"Manchester to Phuket via Doha, and having used Qatar Airways 3 times in the last 12 months, I can`t recomend them enough.

qatar-airways;2016-01-12;"Nice flight on the A380 from London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Although the flights were full flights I felt comfortable because of the spacious cabin layout. Inflight service was good, crews friendly. The A380 has a better, updated version of the Oryx entertainment system. All in all great flights and all on time arrivals.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-11;"Paris to Singapore with transfer in Doha on Qatar Airways business class, this was one of the finest flights. Cabin service was nice, quick and quite friendly, seemed more genuine than my former trip on Singapore Airlines. Meals were delectable, and served line in a fine restaurant. We also had a very nice snack in the business lounge at Hamad Airport on the way there, and this was good. Onboard entertainment very massive choice and impressed me. Seats were comfortable on both aircrafts we flew and good sleep with nice covers and cushions. Recommend and will fly again when we go to Hong Kong in March.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-10;"I was travelling from Barcelona to Singapore, however the connecting flight from Doha to Singapore cancelled. I understand these things can happen, but the treatment was the worst I experienced. I was sitting in the lounge and noticed a Qatar Airways staff walking around with a sign saying Singapore. He told me the flight had cancelled but I had an option to take the flight to Kuala Lumpur and then another flight to Singapore, and assured me I would be in Singapore by 11pm. He disappeared for around 45 minutes and then came back to collect me at 7.20am. But as the flight was due to depart at 7.40am we had to run to the other side of the airport.  At the gate he gave the boarding card for the connecting flight then rushed us onto the aircraft. Only when the plane was taxiing did we discover the boarding card was for a flight that didn't land until 00.15am! He hadn't the courtesy to tell us we were on a different connecting flight. We were met at KL and given paper to put our details as the luggage had not made the flight, but would be couriered to us. 24 hours after landing the luggage hadn't arrived. I contacted Changi Airport to find out Qatar Airways hadn't passed my address and contact details to them. In terms of seat comfort and service does not compare favorably to Singapore Airlines.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-09;"Flew Qatar Airways Shanghai to Montreal via Doha on Boeing 777-300ER in Business Class. Check in at Shanghai was smooth and got my pre-selected seat 6K. Was spending time with my partner who sent me off so didn't go to the lounge. The first leg left Shanghai on time and reached Doha 20 mins early. Cabin crew was professional and cheery, refilled my wines and offered me to try their other wines which I thought was a nice touch. Qatar Airways offer Dine on demand for premium cabin passengers. As this was a late night flight only light meals and breakfast were served but they were reasonably nice. Transfer at Doha was seamless and the lounge was huge and airy, quite crowded but had quiet corners to rest alone. The second leg departing Doha was not as good as the first leg. Boarding chaotic, service was still fair but cabin crew seemed robotic and a little disinterested.  I ordered lamb as main and it was a little overcooked. Arrived Montreal on time. The seat was very spacious and easy to sleep in, but 2-2-2 seating meant that passengers in window seat had to cross over their neighbors to get out. So for me one of the minddle pair of seats would be your choice. IFE was limited for East Asain people but was reasonable considering their main destinations are within Western. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-08;"Manchester to Perth return via Doha, and we were very impressed with all aspects of our travel experience with Qatar Airways. All our flights (4 in all) were well organised and on time. The planes were clean and looked new. Cabin crew were very efficient and helpful. Food was very good for 'plane food' and in economy class. Leg room was very acceptable especially as my husband is over 6 feet tall. Entertainment offered was the same on all 4 flights, but was varied and there was plenty to choose from. The airport at Doha was beautiful and its' structure was much admired by my consultant structural engineer husband. On the return flight we had an 8 hour layover at Doha so decided to book the Airport Hotel for 5-8 hour slot. A little pricey but well worth having a rest and a swim for nearly an hour in a stunning pool on the 4th floor overlooking the concourse. I think the staff were somewhat surprised to find a middle aged couple so keen on a swim so early in the morning! So thank you Qatar Airways, you made a long journey more than bearable.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-08;"The flight attendants were fantastic on my Qatar Airways flight QR725 from Doha to Chicago. I had a very short layover in Chicago (1hr 40) and we landed late, leaving only 50 minutes to get through immigration, collect bags, go through customs, check in bags again, take the train from terminal 5 to terminal 3, clear security check and get to my gate. I thought it was going to be impossible to make it onto my connecting flight to Cleveland, but the flight attendants were amazing. They ensured I was the first to get off the plane (even before first class passengers). They had called ahead to ground staff members and there was someone waiting for me as I exited the aircraft, with a bright orange sign that allowed me to cut to the front of every line (immigration, security check, etc). I managed to go through all the motions in 40 minutes! Not to mention, the flight attendants knew I was stressed about my short layover and gave me some fancy chocolates before I got off the plane to make me feel a little better! Thank you Qatar Airways!";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2016-01-07;"Frankfurt to Singapore via Doha. We were flying back from Singapore and our flight scheduled 2am was delayed till 7.30 am, which meant we would miss our connecting flight to FRA in Doha. We tried to get on an earlier plane, but initially to no avail as it was full. However at check-in, Qatar Airways told us to get back later to see whether they could book us on a partner flight and it worked out smoothly - they gave us 2 options and were willing to accompany us to the check-in of the partner airline. Thanks! Our outbound Qatar Airways flights were really okay. New plane with good working entertainment system, seats with enough leg space, aircon not too cold and good service.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-06;"Frankfurt to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Overall very good experience with some minor flaws. The A350 is a fantastic plane, the A380 also. The seat is very good although the legroom in sleeping position (under the stowing room of the seat in front) could be better, especially if you turn your body when sleeping. The much advertised mattresses are no longer in use. Food is good to very good considered plane conditions. Unfortunately my order (given directly after take off) on the first leg could not be delivered exactly, as they gave away my first course and also the Gewürztraminer wine was no longer available. The IFE comes with a very nice 17"" screen (not stowable). Movie selection could be better for new releases. As I flew back in the same month I had some difficulty to find something interesting for all 4 flights.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2016-01-06;"London to Bangkok via Doha return. I have travelled many times on Qatar Airways in Business Class, mostly to Bangkok but I have also used them from London to Male, Kuala Lumpur and Denpasar. They impress me with consistently high standards on the ground and in the air.  I will always chose to fly with Qatar even if means a stopover rather than a direct flight on another carrier - and always above British Airways who consistently disappoint me! This time I travelled in First Class from Doha to Bangkok and return, and it was outstanding in every way! Discreet, personal,  professional and comfortable all the way! Qatar Airways have their service up to the highest standards possible. It was lovely to see caviar in First Class and a superb selection of wines and champagnes. Entertainment, amenities, sleeper suits and slippers all of great quality and I was able to fully enjoy and fully rest both ways. Their ground service match the inflight services with superb lounges in both London and Doha. With priority boarding and luggage arriving first every time you really do feel that they value you - and they do!";POSITIVE

CPT-DOH with a very fast check in. Final sector of DOH-MXP on an A330 with average seat pitch. Very nice and helpful crew and average food. Good service, and for all the flights departure perfectly in time. All in all a good experience, but a five star airline should not have cramped aircraft for a 9 hours flight.";POSITIVE

It is disappointing an airline cannot provide customers preferred seats. ";NEGATIVE

The Business class lounge in Doha airport is worth getting off for. Same food and service was first class. On my return trip,  the service food etc was just as good and I loved being able to stretch out and sleep. I think it is worth every penny being able to arrive feeling normal after a good nights sleep.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2016-01-04;"Tokyo Haneda to London Heathrow via Doha. I arrived at Tokyo Haneda 6 hours prior to departure due to a domestic flight, but I couldn't check my bags in until 2 hours prior. Japan Airlines handle Qatar Airways at HND, and their check in desks are always open, so I don't know why they can't take their partners bags early. It was also disappointing that Premium Class pax can't use the fast rack security lanes here. But you do get access to Japan Airlines First/Premium Sakura lounge, which has all the facilities you need. Boeing 787 left a few mins late, and once airborne I was asleep on the very comfortable lie flat seat. When I woke up I dined (on demand) on good quality Japanese and Western food, and then rested for the rest of this 12 hour sector. Transfer at DOH was slightly less chaotic than outbound, but it is noticeable that the volume of transfer pax has not been well planned for and security is somewhat lax to get pax through quickly. Signage in DOH is poor, and I struggled to find my way to the Business lounge. Boarding the A380 was a treat (my first time) - we were warmly welcomed by a charming FA who took our coats and offered us a drink. I cannot believe how quiet the A380 is, especially on take-off. We had a great flight, enjoying the lounge bar for a cocktail before lunch, having a nap in the great seats (same as 787) and watching the IFE, A top class journey! But I could not connect to the internet, as it was very slow. So in my free 15 mins worth I didn't download a single page.";POSITIVE

First leg of the journey was 14 hrs and there were 4 meals served with choices of entrees and alcohol beverage choices included for no additional charge. The second leg of the journey began at 1:05 am and the flight attendant began by saying, ""when the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign we will be serving dinner!"" We got our meal shortly before 2am - so I arrived in Kathmandu not a bit hungry. There was an empty seat next to me and I had nice leg room as well. There was a screen on the seat and a place to charge my phone! All the flight attendants were just nice.";POSITIVE

Bizarrely, even though we had booked 9 months previous, my wife and I were allocated seats away from each other. Fortunately we were able to change to adjoining seats. It's not the first time this has happened to us with Qatar. Onboard everything was great as usual, and it was now a Boeing 777, which I think still sets the standard, even though the entertainment system is a bit cluncky. The second leg was an A330 which was either new or had been re-fitted with the new seats and was fine.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"Alexandria to Kuwait via Doha. My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout. I do suggest that people fly on Qatar Airways, it is much more enjoyable than Turkish Airlines for example.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"Hong Kong to Copenhagen via Doha return, Xmas and New Year 2015. The product was stable and predictable and almost fully punctual arrivals. Economy class has poorer food and drink choices. No menu provided, 2-3 options of hot meals offered despite small portions. Service onboard was top notch. three of the four flights were full but the cabin staff managed servicing passengers satisfactorily. Transfer in Doha was slightly better (airbridges 3 times out of 4). Recognised as elite FFP flyer and offered a free upgrade between CPH and DOH due to overbooking in economy. However, I was told that I could not use the upgrade offer as I was travelling with a child on a separate booking. Child meals and toys for kids provided to perfection. Seating arranged well and proactively well adjusted as needed by staff due to full flights. The lounges for Oneworld Elite customers in Doha are substandard . Codeshare and cooperation with the Oneworld partners Cathay Airways and Dragonair faultless in terms of booking, miles crediting, luggage transfers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"Singapore to London via Doha was fine except my in-flight entertainment screen seemed to have a mind of its own. The shows that I were watching kept skipping back and forth and stopped as it pleased on its own accord when I was not even touching the screen or the remote control which was annoying. The meals were okay, some of the side dishes had tastes I was not accustomed to. On my trip home from London to Singapore via Doha, the plane from London arrived at Doha late by about half an hour. Because the transit time was only 45 minutes, we missed the connecting flight back to Singapore and the way they handled this could have been improved. Before we started running to the connecting gate, someone could have informed us that there was no point doing so and bring us to the customer service for alternative flights. When a large group of us approached the customer service, some staff seemed flustered and annoyed instead of calming down the passengers politely. When we asked for an alternative flight, they gave us one which leaves Doha 12 hours later. They should not sell connecting flights with such short times.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;London Heathrow to Ho Chi Minh via Doha. We were late departing London Heathrow (Heathrow Airport fault not Qatar Airways) meaning we missed our connecting flight from Doha to Vietnam. Upon arrival at Doha there was a lady there with our names on a board with new flights to Bangkok which left in 30 mins. She escorted us all the way to the plane. Arrival at Bangkok another Qatar Airways employee was waiting to escort us to the Thai Airways flight they'd booked for us. Arrived in Vietnam about an hour later than original planned. 10/10 customer service. Our bags even made the journey.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"On December 23, we went on a business trip from Amman to Doha, it was my first time onboard Qatar Airways. In general I was pleased with the flight I got on, the crew were excellent and happy all the time, the seats were comfortable, and the IFE system was good. So all in all, the flight was great. The food could be better for a 5 star airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"Abu Dhabi to Perth via Doha return. Uncharacteristically chaotic check-in at Abu Dhabi apparently due to an IT glitch. An issue beyond Qatar's control, however there were no airline agents on hand to provide guidance / control the rapidly-growing queue of irate passengers.  All flights were on time, the planes spotlessly clean, IFE was fully functioning throughout. I was personally greeted as a frequent flier on each leg, and for the vast majority who use economy, Qatar Airways Boeing 777 remains the best in class for long haul comfort. Alas, hot towels are long gone. boiled sweets prior to take off disappeared, and compared to my previous flight in July, chocolate bars are not distributed during the night, metal cutlery replaced by plastic. The flight from Doha to Abu Dhabi was covered by an A320 operated by Qatar's putative (defunct?) Saudi Arabian budget airline, Al Maha. The lack of facilities onboard was not a major issue for a 40 minute flight, though annoying if you'd paid for first class, but rather symptomatic of an airline that no longer seems to go the extra mile for quality.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-31;"Oslo to Dhaka with a 9 hour transit in Doha, and was told if the transit is longer than 8 hours, a hotel will be provided - but they did not provide this. The return flight from Dhaka was through Doha and London, with 3-4 hours transit.  The food was excellent in all flights as it normally is on Qatar Airways. Seat was good and the entertainment system was also nice, especially the touchscreen in the A380 is superb. Turkish Airlines is cheaper and I may therefore prefer them next time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-30;"Economy class from Singapore to London via Doha. The food was dull, and A350 from Singapore is not impressive, there was a leak from the WC in one of the toilet. The FAs were quite courteous, but were not much better than their competitors. One thing that is quite annoying is that they use a different lounge for One World premium members. They have their own lounge for business class passengers, but lounge in Doha airport that I used as BA gold member is pretty much useless. I would probably recommend Qatar Airways if you can get good price.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-28;"London to Singapore via Doha with Qatar Airways. All flights on time except SIN-DOH which arrived 20 mins late. Seating on A330 is 2x2x2 which is a problem, but 1x2x1 seating on the other aircraft means greater privacy. Seats are fine and comfortable enough to sleep. Food was good and available on demand, but on the flight from London the English breakfast had run out by the time my order was taken (row 4). If you choose to eat later in the the flight, there may be little chance of your first or second choices being available. Not a good point for business class. My bland meals to/from Singapore were ok, but the salads were poor and one of the soups was anything but bland it seemed to me. AVOD fine with the greatest choice available on the A350, including a tail mounted camera which gives an amazing perspective of flying at high altitude. All crew good, friendly, efficient and welcoming. Certainly the service is up there with some of the best but they should look at improving quantities of certain dishes which are bound to be popular on certain sectors.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-28;"Paris to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. In a word excellent. Business class does not get better than this with regard to service, food, cabin layout and ambiance. The seat was magnificent with controls that got you into the seat or lying position of your choice. I connected with Aer Lingus from Dublin bypassing the more direct option using either Etihad or Emirates. Smart move. I have used both of these airlines in business on a few occasions and although good in themselves come nowhere near the Qatar Airways product for its elegance, comfort and consistency. Being part of the one world alliance is also an added bonus. Rightly the number one airline offering a lounge in Doha that is just unbeatable. I look forward to their arrival some day into the Irish market. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-28;"ATH-DOH-BKK return with Qatar Airways. Excellent flights, all on time. Food was probably the best I've had in economy class, always with 3 options on each flight. FAs very polite, with a true smile on their face. The A380 on the DOH-BKK sector, is an experience in itself. Excellent IFE, 3D touch screen TV, 15 mins free wifi and on air network service is a top quality product. QR deserves the 5 star ranking and it will be my only choise for my middle and far east flights.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-27;"My flight from São Paulo to Singapore via Abu Dhabi with Etihad was cancelled, so I flew São Paulo to Singapore connecting in Doha with Qatar Airways. First segment, GRU-DOH was in a Boeing 777-300. Very nice seats, excellent service, meals, beverages, chocolate Valrhona. Arrived punctually at Doha, where I had a 2hr 30min connection for the next flight to Singapore. Next segment was in an A350 : a very new aircraft, very nice decoration and design of the business class cabin (no first class). Service onboard also excellent, nice crew, always ready to help and to offer you what you want. No complains and deserves the 5 stars.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-20;"Melbourne to Madrid via Doha. The flights were on time and check in staff very welcoming and efficient. The food was average, service was okay, my headset was broken on one leg and I didn't get a replacement. My main issue was even though at check in I was in an aisle seat, for the longer leg this was changed at the gate and they would not move me again - even though this had happened on my outbound as well within less than a week. I explained my circumstances but the gate person was not interested and was told it was because I was travelling alone.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-19;"Traveled Qatar Airways on route Baku to Oslo via Doha and back. Baku-Doha flight is operated by new A320. Check in was ok. I requested for window seat. No problems. Doha to Oslo red eye flight is operated by Boeing 787. I got an exit seat where two families with small kids were sitting. All night long these kids have cried. So I experienced uncomfortable flight. But nothing the airline can do. Seat pitch was good because of an emergency exit. Very attentive and friendly cabin crew. IFE contained many new movies, musics and games. My flight experience was nice. Would fly with them again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-14;"London to Tokyo Haneda via Doha. As usual it was a pleasure to fly with Qatar Airways, but not perfect. The Business product on the 777 is not the latest, but it is very spacious and so much better than other carriers. Seat was a little hard. My first experience of the Boeing 787 product, which I thought was great, even though at first sight it appears more cramped (I did graze my shin on the TV shelf when trying to get back onto bed). I liked the lav location in the cabin vice galley area. I was surprised that transfer at DOH was worse than at the old airport. bus to and from aircraft and a ridiculously long walk to gate D24 to get bus. Terminal was crowded and confusing. not enough staff or signs to help. My biggest negative is that Qatar Airways has decreased quality and quantity of onboard catering since my last flight. Cheaper Champagne, less choice of food, no celeb chef dishes. Full cabins on both sectors meant my choices had gone by the time I wanted to eat. All I got was a bowl of muesli 1 hr from DOH and 6 pieces of sushi 2 hrs before HND, not good for 13 hours in Business class.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-13;"Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha with Qatar Airways. This was my first long haul flight in a few years, we arrived very late at the airport and only had a few minutes until check in closed. The Qatar Airways staff were waiting for us as we were the last passengers to check in, we were very short on time and the staff escorted us to the security check and managed to get us fast tracked through security so we didn't miss our flight. We boarded the plane and were greeted by the nicest crew I have encountered on a flight. Our first leg of our flight was roughly 7 hours to Doha. The plane was clean and very stylish throughout each seating class. Shortly after take off we were served breakfast which consisted the most amazing meal on an airline. We were served Waffles with strawberries and cream, We also received a hot bread roll, fruit salad, yogurt, water and fresh juice and coffee. After we were served our meal, the cabin was cleared of the breakfast and we could sit back and relax. The inflight entertainment system was great and had hundreds of movies, TV Shows, music, games to keep you happy for the long flight. A few hours into the flight we were served lunch. The food on this airline is some of best. We landed in Doha with a short 4 hour layover which was just enough to explore Qatar Airways hub airport which is a fantastic place. The flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur was to the same high standards and we arrived in Kuala Lumpur feeling relaxed and refreshed. The seat pitch was very good and seats were wide, aircraft was clean and all staff were excellent. The best flight I have ever taken.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-10;"I traveled Qatar Airways from London to Dubai via Doha for the first time.  The prices were comparatively less than Emirates and the stopover was about a hour. Not too much when you saving from 500 Euros. Service was good, as well as the food was fresh. Really happy with the hospitality of Qatar Airways and definitely recommend it.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-10;Flew with Qatar Airways from Singapore to Munich via Doha on QR945 and QR059. Boarding was on time and the cabin was very clean. Cabin crews were very friendly and warmly welcomed everyone who boarded. They gave plush toys to some kids who were onboard and smiled at them. Meal service was quick and on time. The food is very delicious. The inflight entertainment was also the one of the best I have used. Legroom was excellent. Qatar Airways will be my first choice if I have to travel to the Middle East or Europe.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-10;"Travelled Qatar Airways from Dubai to Hanoi via Doha and Bangkok in economy. Three aircraft types (A321, A380, and B777-200). Faultless product, good lounges (for premium card holder travellers), especially in Doha and Bangkok. All flights punctual, luggage delivered promptly. Annoying bus transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha. FA's caring and efficient, even with full flights. Tedious announcements and commercials onboard disturbs the experience. Food and drink service was less, options, smaller portions, less meals (no servings before landing in BKK on this flight). Drinks available throughout however.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-08;"Flew Frankfurt to Ahmedabad via Doha with Qatar Airways. My first leg was on an A350 from FRA-DOH and 2nd with A320 and the same on the way back. A350 was excellent, seats were comfortable both ways. I look forward to flying Qatar Airways again. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-08;"Travelled 5-6 December 2015 with Qatar Airways. Small Aircrafts (A321 and A320, respectively). Flights punctual, baggage perfectly transferred. Though small, a decent, lounge access is now provided in Nairobi after a two years break (since the airport fire in 2013). Access provided to the Swissport Aspire lounge which is a 3rd party lounge) for elite travellers. Service onboard by FAs is world class. Food portions diminishing, but 3 still options for dinner/lunch on economy remain. Wines have now been reduced from four choices a month ago till now only two, red or white - both are mediocre though of Chilean provenances. The most annoying are the lengthy bus cattle-transfers at Doha (yes! They are still ongoing as the jet-bridges are far from sufficient). Secondly, endless announcements, advertisements, and even Qatar charity requests on passengers (""Educate a child"", ""support etc.."") disturbs the IFE systems to the extent of it becoming annoying and useless despite the good movies.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-06;"Frankfurt to Doha with Qatar Airways, on-time departure and arrival. The check-in was ok, some problems that our daughter was too large for the bassinet and a 3rd seat wasn't available. The service onboard was perfect with very polite and attentive crew members. My new suitcase got damaged and even 1 month after I complained no response.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-12-01;"Tokyo to Paris CDG via Doha with Qatar Airways. No problem checking in at Narita airport. Able to get exit window seat with no fuss. Food okay, ordered vegetarian meal. DOH to CDG only 3 passengers in the upper deck section reserved for Privilege club holders, and no other passengers upgraded. Able to lie flat using the middle seats. Had a chat with the attentive stewardess. I wish I will have this experience again!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-30;"London to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways, and very pleased overall - especially with the three of four legs on A380 which I found a great step up beyond what I've seen before. Comfortable and supportive seats and even at 1.84m enough space and so quiet. Service very attentive and polite, all on time and minimal time queuing to board aircraft. Entertainment system, again especially on A380, was excellent. Only great weakness was food - even by airline standards I found it terrible on all four flights - fatty meat, almost nothing green, frequently a stodgy pasty with paste inside referred to as chicken sandwich : not nutritious. Juices also terrible (processed juice drinks). didn't try wines. Such a shame given the service and aircraft quality. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-30;"This is my first trip to Edinburgh with Qatar Airways, this involved four flights in total. The ground service in KL was not good. Kuala Lumpur to Doha was on A330. Since the seat arrangement is 2-4-2, it's no problem for me as I was traveling with my sister. The journey was long but the service was excellent. The cabin crew were really attentive and polite, attending to our needs. On the next flight from Doha to Edinburgh, we boarded the Boeing 787 . The seating arrangement is 3-3-3 so this means we're seated with a stranger. But no matter, we had a good time. The cabin crew for this flight (7+ hours) were even better than the first. Our return flights were smoother, however, the flight crew from Doha to Kuala Lumpur were less friendly, loud, and noisy in the cabin.  The food were excellent especially the breakfast and lunch. The snacks though could be improved. I'd rather have a sandwich than the pastry (thick dough) sandwich. Overall, I had a wonderful experience flying with Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-29;"Perth to London via Doha. The seats were comfortable, got a packet with tooth brush, tooth paste and an eye mask. I also got a blanket and pillow. There was enough room for me to stretch my legs out. Good choice of movies and shows. I was disappointed with food, not much of a choice on the menu and didn't have enough for 11 hour flight. One point they were handing out chicken sandwiches but turned out to be a pastry filled with mush. Staff were okay, they weren't smiling. At least 8 hours into the flight, they eventually handed out small bottles of water. But flight was good, no turbulence, smooth landing in Doha. I was looking forward to a flight on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner but they changed it to a Boeing 777-300er. London to Doha I flew the A380. Great aircraft, good legroom for economy, food was sort of the same, except they handed out a decent chocolate bar. Entertainment systems newer than the 777. They were great, I watched a few movies and slept most of the time. Then another smooth landing at Doha. I was impressed of the A380. Another Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to Perth.  A kid in front of me pushed his seat back on boarding and cabin crew walked by and did nothing until takeoff. Once we took off, the seat came down again for the whole flight. It was difficult to eat food and watch Tv. This plane, my entertainment system would not respond, couldn't press anything without it glitching.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-29;"I was quite pleased by my recent return journey on Qatar Airways. I had the pleasure of flying on both the Boeing 777-200LR as well as the A380 on my journey from Philadelphia to Bangkok via Doha return. The service was courteous and pleasant, the cabins were kept up to date and the food was of good quality. No complaints.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-28;"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. Excellent flights and lounge at Doha. Boeing 787 and A380 seats are the same. But strangely the IFE on the Boeing was nowhere near as extensive as the A380. My wife ordered a veggie meal and the first flight she asked if she could choose something from the regular menu, as the flight was full the answer was no. No problem - but she only received three courses instead of five. Second sector on A380 she could choose anything. The return sector she cancelled the special meal and it was much more enjoyable. On board champagne has changed since I flew QR back in the Spring. Jaquart was offered in the Business cabin, it was okay but the Taittinger Comtres de Chanpagne in the A380 lounge was much nicer. Aspire lounge used at Amsterdam was okay and better than the BA lounge next door. Overall besides Singapore Airlines, I have yet to experience a better Business class flight. Lesson learnt by my wife, don't order a special meal - plenty of veggie choices on the regular menu.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-27;"Clean, fresh and smooth even though the duration of the flight was just 47 mins, every minute of it was totally worth it. I'm impressed with the kind of products offered on this Doha to Dubai shuttle. Nothing more to say, an experience of this would be more than enough of an explanation.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-25;"Although the line was long for the check in, it was an interesting experience to fly again on Qatar Airways, this time on a very long flight from New York JFK to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. The flight was extremely full on the first leg from JFK to DOH on the B77W. Qatar Airways have a very modern and young fleet. Service was excellent and the cabin crew were on top form for this full flight. Food was excellent and IFE was amazing. Transit in DOH was two hours and a lot of walking in this ultra-modern airport. Second leg to KUL was on-board the Boeing 777 but not as full as the first leg. Crew were on top form and consistency of service was impeccable. I will fly with them again thanks to their friendly service.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-25;"I took the route form Tehran to Doha and then to Bangkok. The staff were very efficient and decent and made me feel at home and survive an eight-hour flight. Attendants were always around just in case. You can expect what you have in mind about 5-star airline with Qatar Airways. After my first flight with this airline, I have no doubt using Qatar Airways again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-24;"Flying Qatar Airways for the second time because we love the new A350, we were a little disappointed at first that their was an aircraft change from FRA to DOH. Instead of the A350 we flew on the Boeing 777, and the business class seat does not compare to the state-of-the-art cabin in the A350. Nevertheless - service was impeccable and we enjoyed the flight. From Doha to Bangkok and return it was the scheduled A380 with the brand new seats. Flying in business class does not get any better than that. The Sky Lounge Bar on board is quite a plus"". Last leg Doha back to Frankfurt was in the A350 was definitely my favorite! Qatar is truly a 5-star airline!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-23;"Flew Qatar Airways from London to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to London via DOH. Check-in at LHR was very straightforward and quick. Arrived at the gate and was informed I had been upgraded to the upper deck. Had a row to myself up stairs on the A380,  which is a great aeroplane and very comfortable. Transit through Doha is very easy and plenty of shopping opportunity to pass the time. Flight to KUL was full but still very comfortable. Operated by a Boeing 777-200LR (A7-BBF) which again was in great condition and very clean. Flew back from Singapore on the A350 (A7-ALE). Didn't find the seats as comfortable as those on the A380 or Boeing 777 to be honest but was great to be on the A350 regardless. Final flight back to London on a Boeing 777-300ER. Had to move from my initial seat (26C) as the entertainment screen was not working. However the reassigned 36C meant I had the whole row to myself. Overall great crews and ground staff. Decent choice of movies and TV to watch. My only suggestion would be to offer 2 meals and not 1 meal.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-20;"We had 4 flights with Qatar Airways, booked earlier this year for a special fare. Overall experience is that the aircraft were quite new and looked clean. However on the back of some seats, trays and windows dirt was visible. I found the most comfortable seats were on the B777, they seemed to be a bit wider and had a bit more legroom. The least comfortable seats were on the A380. On the B787 there are IFE boxes underneath the seats reducing footspace quite a bit. The climate inside the aircrafts was most comfortable on the B787 where the air was not as dry. Cabin services were good, with quality food and drinks. Hamad International Airport on the stopover in Doha is spacious and clean, easy to spend 2 to 3 hours there until the connecting flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-19;"Beirut to Muscat. Qatar Airways service is great, new and well kept planes, multicultural staff, so language will not be a major problem. The flights were on time, food is very good but sometimes too gourmet, so if you don't like tasting over prepared food, it may be a problem. Cabin crew were always there to check if you need something. I asked for some sweet wine, they didn't have it but the crew immediately added some soda on it to make it sweet - I felt they are very well trained. Had some flights with them and will not think twice before booking Qatar Airways again in the future.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-18;"We flew Qatar Airways in business class as a family, from Nairobi to Delhi return, via Doha both ways. There was a fantastic crew on all the flights, and they were personal and very attentive. Great inflight entertainment, and also amazing food and drink.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-18;"Qatar Airways deserves the praise it receives. Kathmandu to London Heathrow via Doha leaving KTM on October 30th. The original flight was at 1230 from KTM with connecting flight at 1720 out of DOH to LHR. Whilst trekking in Nepal, the daily flights were consolidated due to fuel problems at KTM with the new flight now at 1610. We were unaware of this and went to check-in at 0930 (along with others who were unaware of the change). Qatar Airways had staff in position, re-booked the whole journey efficiently and found seats on the DOH to LHR flight at 0630 next day - the young man stated that accommodation etc would be supplied at DOH and lunch was also given to us at KTM. All in all a generally pleasant wait ensued. Upon arrival at DOH , the QR transfer/hotel desk needed firm handling as they denied that a hotel was needed, a voucher for a pizza or similar was acceptable and a wait of 11 hours at the airport was ok etc - after meaningful discussions, hotel and dinner was supplied for a number of pax on the consolidated flight and everything was deemed satisfactory. What a shame that QR wasted so much time with tired and fractious pax denying accommodation and food - Kathmandu staff acknowledged the problem and handled the matter with speed, courtesy and efficiency only to have DOH staff cause stress. Well handled by Kathmandu, let down by Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-18;"Istanbul to Manila via Doha. Flight to Doha from Istanbul was fine. The seat configuration on this flight was 2x2 in business class and there were 12 business class seats on A321 aircraft. My headset was dysfunctional. After a mundane meal service, I dozed off. We got to Hamad International Airport and proceeded to the Al Mourjan Lounge. The lounge was pretty packed, we were lucky enough to find a table at the restaurant and ordered the fillet steak, disappointing that the steak was overdone. Service was great in the Al Mourjan Lounge.  We transferred to the area near the family rooms to take a shower. The lounge staff informed us it was the final call for boarding at our gate so we rushed to find out that boarding haven't commenced yet and there was no separate boarding area for business class. Right after take off, I fell into a slumber. Three hours later, a female cabin crew approached us and asked for our meal preference. I have to commend her for attentively paying attention to what we needed. She was at our beck and call so for that, she deserves proper credits. Cabin crew service was exceptionally five star class. Despite that, they need to step it up when it comes to food selection and quality at lounges and boarding service. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-16;"Qatar Airways from London Heathrow to Lagos via Doha, return. Qatar has many virtues such as pleasant crew, good seating, immaculate aircraft and excellent wine. The entrée course food quality and portion size was appalling as was the dry, hot snack before landing. There was little to interest me in the inflight entertainment, and I found it difficult to operate. The new airport in Doha is pleasing to the eye but signage is poor. Luckily there are many customer service agents on duty to assist.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-16;"Delhi to Rome via Doha with Qatar Airways. It's always a delight to fly in a brand new aircraft, and this Boeing 787 and Qatar Airways impeccable service made it a lot better. The flight took off on time. Throughout the flight, drinks and light snacks were on the offer. I had ordered for a Hindu non-veg meal and it was lip-smacking. Most importantly, I am 6 ft tall but still managed to find a comfortable leg space.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-15;In the early morning on November 12th me and my wife were onboard Qatar Airways 069 from Doha to Frankfurt. Our seats were in row 6 in front of the lavatories. The aircraft departed with a slight delay at Doha and arrived at Frankfurt ahead of the scheduled arrivak time. The seat comfort of Qatar Airways lie flat seats is very comfortable. The aircraft looked and is of course pretty new. The flight attendants worked professionally. Food and beverages were great and meals were served at the time the passenger prefers. Overnight kits from Armani and complimentary pyjamas were provided. ;POSITIVE

We had a confirmed seat reservation in row 82 which was changed by the ground staff to row 32 on the upper deck of the 380. The seat comfort is a bit worse in comparision of the previous flight on an A350, but it was still good. The onboard service and food and beverage were good as well, and so was the onboard entertainment system. The aircraft was fully booked with only a few seats left vacant. The lavatories and the interieur of the A380 were clean and pretty new.";POSITIVE

The seating in our row 12 was outstanding. The cabin was spotless clean, service very professional and highly motivated. The food and beverage were excellent. Overnight kits from Georgio Armani as well as complimentary pyjamas were provided. The inflight entertainment remote control on one seat didn't work properly at the beginning but the flight attendants got it fixed. The business class was fully booked. Every passenger was asked by the crewmembers at the end of flight about their impressions or if they would like to complain. In our opinion the flight attendants did a great job and couldn't do any better.";POSITIVE

Three of the longer flight sectors were on the new A380. I prebooked a seat in the upstairs economy zone on all flights, which proved to be a good choice. This zone was small but quiet and very spacious. I thought the seating was one of the best I have been on in Economy class. The staff, food and entertainment were all top notch. Its also a plus to fly via the new airport in Doha, very easy to navigate unlike Dubai.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-13;On 24th October we flew Qatar Airways from Frankfurt to Doha. Our seats were located in row 36 on the port side of the aircraft. The A350 aircraft was extremely clean and the seat comfort quite good for economy. The food and beverages served were above standard. The service onboard was at a high level compared to other airlines on this routing. The overall experience pretty good.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-13;I use a wheelchair and flew from Berlin to Bangkok via Doha. I did the booking in April 2015 and all seats were confirmed. When I made the web check in my companion got other seats than I. At check in it was not possible to solve the problem. Doha to Bangkok I got other seats. It was not possible to receive my wheelchair in Doha. I had to use an airport wheelchair which was too small. The transfer to my seat was also not very professional with their right equipment. On the way back in BKK I didn't get the confirmed seat. I got a seat (43D A380) with unmoveable armrests and it was difficult to sit down. The food was on both legs the same and the bar service was good. ;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-12;"London to Singapore via Doha. Very impressed with the economy service and product offering on Qatar Airways on their brand new A380 and A350 aircraft. Aircraft spotlessly clean on both legs. Seating the same on both aircraft, very comfortable with good legroom and reasonable seat width. Felt more cramped on the A350. Crew professional and friendly on both legs. Good meal services on both flights, although I note on daylight flights in this case London to Doha the meal service and offering is much more extensive than on the early morning flights 0230am from Doha to Singapore. Inflight entertainment good and extensive choice not just of Western movies/tv but content from around the world. The Oryx IFE system they use is not that user friendly and can be clumsy. 15 minutes free wifi offered on both flights, but no point in using as the system times out constantly. Bathrooms kept clean throughout both flights. Only real negatives about experience, very long and drawn out safety announcements done in both Arabic and English but not simultaneously, way too much advertising of Qatar Airways, Qatar banks etc. Inflight entertainment interrupted too many times with charity videos and arrival videos for Doha. The new Doha airport for economy class passengers very bland, very poor food outlet choices, expensive shops, but lack of sitting area, shower and rest facilities for such a major global hub.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-11;"Hanoi to Nairobi via Bangkok and Doha. Excellent service at check-in in Noi Bai International Airport. NIA Business Lounge in T2 is very good and spacious. Onboard proactive FAs provide a good mood and proper care. The product has changed slightly in recent months in economy class with smaller food portions though 3 options are offered on menu card. Champagne is not served in economy class but an amenity kit is still provided. Excellent language skills among the crew. All flights on time. Reliability and precision of the airline high. FAs are professional, fresh, and often in a sparkling mood. I never had experienced a significant delay with Qatar Airways, but am annoyed by eternal bus-transfers in Doha. HIA was supposed to have this improved but I do not see much change nor direct gate access. Onboard the worst part is the the slow safety video, lengthy, numerous commercials (esp. on tourism, banking, and HIA glamourisation). Even worse are QR charity initiatives which are imposed on all passengers. Drink rounds have been less on my flights and are no separate round offered prior to meals - which can be delayed for 1-2 hours into the flight";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-10;". When I entered, I got astounded with the sheer opulent details. The high ceiling, the furnishings and all that. Basing everything on In-Flight Service not the seat configuration and design and the whole experience, I would fly ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-10;"I flew Johannesburg to Dubai via Doha return with Qatar Airways. Simply the best airline and deserving of 5 Stars. The Boeing 787 is really a great aircraft in and out of Johannesburg . Being used to flying on bigger jets for long haul, I prefer the smaller long haul jets. Onboard service and amenity kit was impressive for an economy class ticket. Great all round.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-09;"Perth to Edinburgh via Doha. Planes modern and spacious, I could see the Boeing 787 could be cramped if full but the large windows and lower cabin pressure make experience better. Very little jet lag on my arrival. Very pleasant flights helped by being able to have three seats to myself on both flights. Staff pleasant if not overly friendly. Food okay on Perth to Doha segment. Breakfast on leaving Doha much better but pastry and savoury snack before landing in Edinburgh not great. Doha Airport good on quiet midweek morning but quite expensive for food and drinks. Onward connection from Edinburgh to Belfast straightforward as bags checked all the way through and just needed to pick up boarding pass from flybe staff. Overall a very easy way to connect to Northern Ireland from Australia.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-09;"Oslo to Bangkok via Doha. The business class product is still excellent, and the crew was friendly and attentive as usual. Small things are cut back, the amuse bouche from Oslo, drink after takeoff, amenity kit. Still value for money. One thing that annoys is the IFE remote which is sluggish and unresponsive, unless you by chance touch it with your elbow - not very smart placement in the seat. DOH to BKK they do a full dinner menu, very slow on a flight that leaves after midnight. I gave up and went to sleep. Tried the on board lounge for canapés, but they only had nuts. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-09;"Heathrow to Abu Dhabi via Doha in Economy with Qatar Airways. We are Oneworld Ruby card holders so from the time of booking got access to reserving seats which was great. Our first flight was on the A380 so we got seats reserved in the small cabin at the back of the upper deck (only 7 or 8 rows). When we checked our bags we were able to use Business class check in (Oneworld benefit was honoured! However the seats we had chosen months ago were changed when we tried online check in and I could not change them. Frustrating that the agent at the desk could not change this back and we were referred to another desk to the flight supervisor who to be fair despite arguing with me about ""accepting"" those seats when I checked in online, did change them to our original preference. I was grateful for this and thanked her. Onboard the seat on the A380 is really good. Thin seat, but comfortable and plenty of personal space including legroom. The recline is very good, but thankfully for me no one in front other wise it would have been in my face. There's a decent sized IFE screen and a reasonable choice of movies. Despite this cabin only being half full it took about 90 mins before we were offered any service which was lunch. Nice enough, but the entree portion was small, and drinks were offered with the meal almost like an afterthought. Throughout the flight the crew were friendly and responsive if you asked for more drinks, but not proactive. Close to arrival we were served a wrap and muffin which were nice. Transferring at Hamad international was a breeze, you literally walk through a supervised glass door straight back into the departure lounge (it is different on your return). Really nice modern and relatively quiet airport at 7pm local time. For westerners there is nice French themed bar and restaurant that serves alcohol in the departure lounge. The second leg to Abu Dhabi was less than an hour in duration. The seat comfort was fine on the Boeing 777-300 and it had IFE if you wanted it. The crew served a savoury pastry and cake with a cuplet of orange juice.  Overall the experience felt good value for money, albeit I wasn't bowled over given the 5 star experience I was expecting. I just think they could have made a massive impact if they'd provided a more proactive service on the upper deck economy section of the A380";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-09;"Flew home from Abu Dhabi to London Heathrow via Doha. First flight on Al Maha branded A320. Check in was fine and like our outbound flights our Oneworld ruby status was honoured and despite travelling in economy we checked in at the business class desk. On board this aircraft the legroom was really tight and I'm glad we only had less than a one hour flight. This Al Maha configuration has no seat back IFE, but this was not a problem as the flight was so short. We were served a savoury pastry and cake and a cuplet of orange juice. We arrived at Hamad International a few minutes early and the transfer process was quick and slick. Handbaggage X-Ray and personal metal detector screening. Relaxing time back in the departure lounge. Boarding was stress free as they do it by seating zone for economy. The seat was comfortable on the Boeing 777-300 and legroom more than adequate for a 7 hour flight. In common with my outbound flight the service was slow, over an hour before any service (we were in the third row of economy cabin). Dinner was nice, but entree portions are small. Drinks only served with dinner. After this you could get more drinks if you asked but the crew were not proactive offering anything other than occasional glasses of water or orange juice. Close to arrival a savoury pastry and cake accompanied by orange juice were served. I'd fly Qatar Airways again at the right price point, but I'm struggling to see why they are rated 5-star.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-08;"London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. First flight on Boeing 777, Doha to Bangkok on the A380. Both flights with excellent service and food. Seating on Boeing 777 okay, terrible on A380. My review concerns the latter part of the trip. We were late arriving at DOH - no explanation or apology. So we were then late at the departure gate, where our boarding passes were checked 4 times - with the staff standing in sight of each other - crazy. The seats on the A380 lower deck were cramped and legroom was short. At least one person had their dinner tipped in their lap from inconsiderate 'seat recliners' in front. When the pax in front of me reclined their seat, I couldn't watch my screen. I wear glasses, and with the screen so close to my face I couldn't focus. Sleeping was not comfortable, with my knees jammed against the seat in front (I'm average build, 5'10 height). When are airlines in cramped economy class, going to restrict the amount seats recline?";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-07;"Heathrow to Colombo via Doha. The Qatar Airways lounge at Terminal 4 Heathrow is excellent. We were able to eat a tasty three course meal before take off and then able to bed down as soon as we took off. The small business class only jet to Doha was spacious and comfortable. The airline staff were courteous and attentive. Upon arrival at Doha we whisked into the Lovely Business class lounge and had enough time for a cup of Dilmah tea (Ceylon) before boarding the A340 to Colombo. This second plane was spacious and very comfortable. The new configuration and seats are excellent with lovely flat beds and plenty of room. Staff were outstanding as was service, food and beverages. Our return to London was on another A340 followed by an A380. Both flights also had excellent, attentive staff. Qatar Airways were extremely helpful, polite and accessible at all times. Thanks for making our holiday so enjoyable.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-06;"Manchester to Bangkok via Doha return, and a superb trip with Qatar Airways. Check in at Manchester business desk took only a few minutes then on to the Escape lounge which was quite full, perhaps one day Qatar will have their own lounge in Manchester and maybe a complimentary Chauffeur service. Boarded and a member of cabin crew asked about drinks while others introduced themselves, always a nice touch, took off virtually on time. A330 is a nice aircraft, small business class section with comfortable seats, decent selection of movies, food very good as usual on Qatar. Arrived Hamad International a few minutes ahead of time and disembarked into airport, no bus. As I had a few hours to spare went to the Al Mourjan lounge until gate for Bangkok advised. Bangkok flight on the A380, some of the departure gates designed with this aircraft in mind as separate business class gate and upstairs lounge to board direct to upper section. Much bigger business section with 48 seats, very comfortable but strange seats no arm rest of the left hand side until you reclined the seat. Good flight, again managed to sleep for a short time before arriving at Bangkok. Return flights just as good despite an 8 hours transit in Doha (more about that in the lounge review) I always get messed up with the different Airbus A330 models but the one from Doha to Manchester was different from the first flight, looked a little older and smaller. I can’t praise the Qatar crews on all four flights enough, brilliant service with maybe the best food on any airline. The only thing that spoilt a perfect trip was that between Bangkok and Manchester my case was damaged in three different areas, it looked like to main damage was done by the wheels of another case.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-05;"Stockholm to Melbourne via Doha. The first time flying with Qatar Airways and it won´t be the last, it was as good as it gets when flying economy class. The Boeing 787 from Stockholm to Doha was quiet and smooth and with great service of crew and inflight entertainment. The leg room was ok but the seat width is a little tight, but overall a great flying experience. Doha to Melbourne on the Boeing 777-300 with more space - both legroom and seat width. The crew gave just as good service, made the 13,5hour flight as good as it can possibly get, even my 85year old father didn´t have any complaints. The return trip was just as good, well done Qatar keep up the good work.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-04;"For the first time in my life I enjoyed a trip by plane of more than 12 hours, this was flying Qatar Airways from Rome to Bangkok via Doha in Economy class. That's all I have to say and recommend! ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-03;"London to Shiraz via Doha, returning from Tehran. Qatar Airways 1x2x1 business class layout on the A380 top deck means every seat has aisle access. They are angled away from the aisle to make them more private, have lots of storage space (plus big overhead bins) and are very comfortable. There are two toilets at the front and two at the back and the lounge area (which surprisingly didn't seem to be used much) makes the whole area feel spacious. Passengers in the small economy section at the rear of the top deck are entirely separate and not allowed to use the lounge or wander through the business area. The cabin service and food was faultless. Qatar Airways cabin staff are specifically trained for the A380 and it certainly shows. A nice touch is that each passenger has a designated crew member who introduces him/herself before take off and says goodbye before landing. The A320 has old style business class seats but these were fine for relatively short flights.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-11-01;"Brussels to Bangkok return via Doha on Qatar Airways. All flights on time, very clean aircraft. The crew was very friendly and food very good. I can only recommend this airline. I will fly with them definetely again!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-26;"As a first time traveller with Qatar Airways I must say that I cannot fault any part of the service received on this trip. I also travelled the route in the opposite direction a few weeks earlier. Staff most attentive and food outstanding. It was exciting to experience the A380, but my preference would be the Boeing 777 business cabin, being much more more intimate and personal than the much larger A380. I also believe the seat is better on the Boeing 777. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-25;"Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha. I tried Qatar Airways early this year between London and Cape Town return in economy. I was so impressed by the service I decided to give the business class a try, and I have to say it really does feel like 5 star compared to the airlines I normally use. Check in at Schiphol was quick and polite directed to the Aspire lounge - a 3rd party lounge which is fine although busy. Boarding on time by class, once onboard the service was 2nd to none! The seat on the Boeing 787 (2A) was comfortable a great environment. The crew on this flight I could not fault and neither could I fault the food which was presented well and tasted great.  On time departure and arrived 15 minutes early. Hamad Airport in Doha is fantastic I used the lounge during my 2hr transit which again was really 5 star - lots of space great food and. service. Boarding for the 2nd flight from gate B2 orderly with business passengers boarded on the 2nd floor, seat 22A - once again the same as the Boeing 787, comfortable and lots of room. Crew and food on this flight was better than the previous flight. Arrived on time and an airline I will use again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-22;"My wife and two of our children thoroughly enjoyed all 4 Qatar Airways flights, from Amsterdam to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. The standard of cuisine and other catering was very high, but they did seem to run out of things early in each flight. Maybe they shouldn't over play dining options and (wonderful) spirit and wine choices. The rose champagne was finished before take off in AMS. Being patriotic I ordered a Glenfiddich as my post departure drink from SGN and there wasn't any. The Meursault wine was finished after one glass out of AMS and SGN. On each occasion I was told they would try to get me my dining options subject to what their colleague had been asked for in the other aisle. I formed the impression that there was calculated stocking of food and using up depleted stocks of their excellent drinks cellar. I spoke to the cabin director on one matter. The business class seat layout of the Boeing 787 is 1x2x1. My wife and I sat in the middle with the children on either side. It was clear we were travelling together but they could not comprehend that my wife and I would want to dine together and insisted that we take service at different times from different crew. Sorted on the last flight after a wee chat. Please don't get me wrong. These are minor gripes about a superb airline with an amazing Business Class facility in Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-21;"Our seats were changed last minute when boarding from Singapore to Doha, even after we have checked in online and have seats confirmed and printed out our boarding passes as instructed by email.

When we did a feedback we were told that advance seat reservations can never be guaranteed.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-20;"Stockholm to Phuket via Doha with Qatar Airways. Outstanding, absolutely fantastic flights. Knocks spots off British Airways Club world which we normally use.

qatar-airways;2015-10-17;"Dubai to Doha and 2 days later Doha to Kuwait. First leg was with an A320 short trip, nice cabin layout, all looks brand new. Economy was comfortable. no entertainment since its a short flight, just a snack as onboard meal. no Arabic announcement. Crew were Asians, not Arabic speakers and same thing on the DOH-KWI flight. However a Boeing 777 with less than 50 passengers. Overall a good flight. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-16;"We flew from Manchester to Doha on an A330, and it was comfortable and service good. The next plane from Doha to Denpasar was a Boeing 787 and what an uncomfortable plane this was. You could not move when the person in front of you reclined their seat. The menu for breakfast was hot fish and rice or pancakes. We were only sat three rows from where they started service but by the time they got to us there was only fish and rice left. I explained that my wife does not eat fish but was told that's all, so she ate nothing. We had the same flights back and only fish and rice left. The other meal we had was cold, and when we mentioned this to the crew member they said they would reheat. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-13;"A great flight with Qatar Airways from Cape Town to Istanbul via Doha. Business Class service on the ground and onboard is truly excellent.

Qatar Airways have good fares too.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-10;"Tokyo Narita to Stockholm via Doha. At Narita, Qatar Airways  ground service is operated by partner Japan Airlines, quick and efficient for check in and luggage. Lounge is comfortable and quiet but food offer is rather poor as often in Japan. Long walk to the gate but we had been warned it would take 10 minutes. Easy boarding, on a Boeing 777, nice welcome by a crew member who showed us to our seats. Same comfort and lie flat bed as on the outward flight. I chose more international food, it was a light dinner due to late departure (10pm), nothing fantastic but good and nice presentation, all dishes brought to your seat, no trolley up and down the aisle. I watched two films. Could sleep well and had ordered a light breakfast which was served 90 mins before landing. Arriving at Doha at 4am, access by jetway but long way to walk, time to walk to the lounge, hardly anybody there, it was 0430 - went upstaors to restaurant which starts at 5am. Could get some tea at once then chose the buffet which I found more attractive than a la carte menu. I had a nice full breakfast out of a large choice of western and oriental style products. Then a shower, no waiting, though lounge was getting more crowded with several flights arriving. 4hr layover went as a breeze, with waiting time in a quiet and comfortable place, with good wifi connection and power socket to charge iphone and ipad. I got boarding information by SMS than on the airport screen so started to move to gate on time as it was very far, 15 minutes walk including moving sidewalks to get there. Boarding by bus, one reserved to business class passengers. Same welcome on board Boeing 787. Crew took orders for meal - chose an arabic breakfast as it was 9am and some extra things such as french pastries. I don't drink alcool and did not watch IFE except the flight route. Twice crew asked if I wanted extra drinks or food. Landing at Stockholm, some walk thru immigration to reach luggage delivery, our cases arrived on belt less than 5 minutes after we had been there. Both flights, as both outbound flights were exactly on time. I was a bit worried with the luggage after reading some comments, but this service deserves full marks - except lounge of airline partners in NRT and ARN. I certainly fly Qatar Airways again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-09;"First experience on Qatar Airways, flying from Stockholm to Tokyo via Doha.  I usually fly Air France but got bored with low quality and tried QR because of special business class offer for flights from Europe. Only negative point was lounge in Stockholm that is small, not that comfortable with very basic food offer. All the rest was great. A brand new Boeing 787 from Stockholm to Doha, day flight, lovely food, nice crew. Arrived in Doha around 5pm, bus transfer, special bus for business, transfer to terminal building took just a few minutes. Doha Airport is huge and we missed direction to the lounge but very helpful staff to show the way. The lounge in Doha was comfortable with large offer for food either downstairs or at restaurant upstairs, lounge was busy, we had 8 hours layover but we found a comfortable place to sit, and rest with excellent wifi connection. Could have a shower without having to wait, nice dinner in restaurant before boarding for Tokyo NRT around 1am. Boeing 777 from DOH to NRT, not so sophisticated seat than on Boeing 787 but somehow more roomy and very comfortable. Both flights with full flat bed. Food on board second flight was great, possible to order anything from the menu anytime. I just had a light treat after take off and chose the Japanese meal before arriving in Tokyo, great Japanese Kaiseki food. Gangway to reach the terminal, some walk , no waiting at immigration, and luggage arrived 5 minutes after we had reached the delivery hall. We could be in the Narita express to Tokyo 45 minutes. I won't comment wines and alcohol either onboard or at the lounge as I do not drink any, and no comment on IFE as I prefer to read or sleep, but their flight info and maps are very sophisticated and I left it on all the way thru. Great company and great value for price.";POSITIVE

Exceptionally comfortable seats/beds, all of the accoutrements, great service, quality food and wine.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-09;"Most airlines have had seat-back pockets capable of stowing a reading book and a case for my glasses, but on this A380 the seat pockets are tiny. I'm 5'10"" tall but could not reach the air vents. The flight passed reasonably well until meal time. I was treated to their cooked breakfast on the sector from Doha to London. It might almost have been palatable (ignoring the dreaded chicken sausage), were it not for the fact that I had had that same breakfast on the flight from Bangkok to Doha.  They offer snacks on their flights, in this case a Mars bar and crisps, which I found greasy. I was offered a choice of sandwiches : lamb or chicken, but instead found heated pastry parcels containing minced who-knows-what. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-08;"I recently traveled four long haul flights (London to Bangkok return via Doha) with Qatar Airways, and despite the fact I was both severely lacking sleep and rather hungover on each occasion, I found that each flight was was up there with some of the most pleasant flights I have had the pleasure to be on. I usually fly Business and or First class but on this occasion I had decided to travel to Thailand at extremely short notice (roughly 3 hours), so therefore my business partner accidentally booked tickets in economy. Which is not usually my preference when taking a flight. Yet I could not find fault with the level of service I received on each flight and in particular the flight QR9 from Doha to London, was simply exceptional. I cannot thank the cabin crew of Qatar Airways enough for making what could have easily been a set of nightmare journeys for myself. In the end, amazing. If you are considering booking with Qatar Airways and find yourself somewhat hesitant due to having read some of the bad reviews, I would ask you to consider the fact that when It comes to reviews of anything you can be almost certain that they tend to be completely polarised viewpoints. And as such you should treat them with a pinch of salt. Go with an open mind, you'll probably find your flight just fine. Or allow yourself to enjoy it despite little problems and you might, like me feel the need to write a review because it was such a great experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-07;"Edinburgh to Perth via Doha with Qatar Airways, very difficult to criticise any aspect of this journey.

Excellent wine and food - everything was refined and and sophisticated. The business class lounge in Doha is so big with many areas and seats. The only negative feedback is regarding the ground staff who need to match the professionalism of Qatar Airways cabin staff. I hope i will have the opportunity again to fly with Qatar Airways business class.";POSITIVE

The cabin crew were attentive at all times and had a smile on their face. If they did not have the desired option of food they politely replied that they did not have and recommended something else suitable for the passenger. IFE System was the new Oryx which had every movie one would like. They even featured cartoons and TV serials for kids in all languages with subtitles. The food was great, they offered lamb biryani as well as sandwich with vegan or chicken filling. The seats were comfortable which helped me sleep for some time. I would recomend Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-10-01;"We flew London to Dubai through Doha, using Qatar Airways for the first time. My expectations were high after all their ads about 5 stars airline etc, and I'm glad to say we would agree with most of that. Boeing 777 was comfortable and clean, and surprisingly the lavs were clean the 2 times I used them. A full meal and snack served, which was more than enough for what was not a very long flight. Inflight entertainment was great, but when will airlines stop the dreadful ads that they inject every time you stop, start etc. Doha airport was big, but found it quite easy to make our transfer, and enjoyed some great coffee there while waiting - it was busy though! Cabin crew were a mixed bunch of nationalities and types, but generally we found them friendly and obliging, and efficient - reminded me a bit of the Lufthansa no-nonsense efficiency. Looking forward to the return and hope it is as good.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-30;"We had a dreadful experience with Qatar Airways travelling QR2 on 13th Sept 2015. We were delayed 2 hours because a passenger onboard wasn't feeling well as the plane was taxiing out. Instead of offloading this passenger, the captain decided to wait for a doctor to treat them. The passenger was found to be fit to travel and we departed 2 hours late. This meant we missed our connecting flight at Doha for the onward leg to the Maldives. What made us angry was that our connecting flight was still on the ground at Doha when we landed, but couldn't be held for a short time to allow connecting passengers to board. On arrival we were presented with transfer and hotel vouchers as we disembarked at Doha at 7.30am. We were not allowed to retrieve luggage and were taken by minibus to a hotel on the outskirts of Doha (the Golden Ocean), which seemed like a 2 star hotel. We tried to sleep but this proved impossible as the hotel is situated next to a building site - there was constant drilling and hammering all day long.  Not having access to any of our luggage compounded the misery, as we couldn't change into clean clothes. We were collected at 10pm for the flight to the Maldives which departed at 1am. No member of staff apologised at any time - we felt abandoned. We missed 2 nights sleep in a row and arrived at our holiday destination shattered.  We spent the holiday fretting about the return journey, as the connection time was a mere 55 minutes, and we dreaded missing it. The final insult was being told our flight from Doha back to London was departing late because it was waiting for some passengers coming in on a delayed flight. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-25;"On 18th Sept I was flying Qatar Airways from Bucharest to Doha, and in Doha I was supposed to change the plane and get into another flight of Qatar Airways for Bangalore. The flight from Bucharest got delayed and I missed the connecting flight to Bangalore. However, I am very appreciative about the ground staff of Qatar Airways who took excellent care of me, communicating the reason and making me feel comfortable, while in the meantime they got me a stay arrangement done in Doha, until I had the next available flight to Bangalore, which was the next day. This makes me say 5 Stars to Qatar Airways for excellent customer care. Thanks.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-24;"Frankfurt to Doha with Qatar Airways on an A350, with the best and widest ever seats in economy class! Very good service from truly international cabin staff. Easy job, with the aircraft not full. Food was disappointing, a very good Chilean wine and excellent hot, tasty coffee. Extremely nice 3D flight info. The Doha to Colombo flight was on an older Boeing 777 that was disappointing after the A350 flight from Frankfurt. Flight full, not enough staff and seats not so comfortable, with old IFE.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-23;"Qatar Airways Boeing 777 is better than it's Boeing 787. Despite a little older seats, the cabin layout is much more spacious with a 3x3x3 seat layout. Cabin crew service is adequate, and the inflight entertainment is excellent.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-23;"Was looking forward to experience Qatar Airways Boeing 787, but disappointed by the cramped 3-3-3 seat layout. Cabin staff service was adequate and efficient, but maybe not 5 stars. The inflight entertainment on was great. Qatar Airways has competitive pricing, which is something to consider when purchasing a ticket.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-22;I've been Platinum with Qatar for some years now and Emirates are far better - with better lounges but they don't fly from GYD. The prices in Doha Duty Free often substantially higher than shops in many countries. QR lounges outside of Doha are substandard. There is only one lounge in DOH so if you are flying from a remote gate you have miles to walk. The downstairs gate I used (E26-30 I think) is like a zoo and they expect you to sit and wait till the flight has boarded before putting you on the business class bus. ;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-22;"Scheduled late Qatar Airways departure from Bangkok means we immediately recline and sleep, without food or drink. QR cabins on the Boeing 777 are excellent. Staff friendly, helpful and efficient. Transit at DOH is a joy, with sufficient time to shower and eat a little food in the Business Class lounge. Re-boarding from DOH on the Boeing 787 was more efficient than previously. A little more sleep and modest food consumption near arrival at EDI made for an ideal flight. Excellent experience throughout.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-22;"Check-in at EDI much improved on last year. Flight departure on time. Crew on first sector EDI-DOH seemed a bit unco-ordinated on my side of the central aisle. The all day dining concept did not seem to be properly co-ordinated. Food is served, but without wine at the same time. When I requested a glass it never arrived. I consequently left my main course untouched. Although my partner's meal service was better on his side of the aisle, he only received his glass of wine after he had finished eating lunch.  Arrival in DOH allowed for sufficient time to shower and have a drink and snacks in the Business Class lounge. Service on the DOH-BKK sector was infinitely better, but as I had opted to sleep, I only ordered a cheese course, and could sleep for the remainder of the flight. Have to mark down based on EDI-DOH staff performance.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-21;"Qatar Airways flights from Kuala Lumpur to Manchester via Doha. The flight boarding efficient and smooth. AVOD from Kuala Lumpur to Doha was better on this flight than our inbound flight. This flight was full, but there was a lack of drink runs and the food was poor. Flight from Doha to Manchester was also full, the food was slightly better but tasteless. Overall a good flight let down by poor food.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-21;"CPH-DOH-BKK-HAN on Qatar Airways Boeing 787, A380, and Boeing 777-300 respectively. All aircraft extremely well maintained. All flights on time. Excellent service on all legs despite business class were full in all cases. FA’s extremely professional, kind, fit, energetic, and caring, keeping the passengers in focus throughout. Food plenty and creatively cooked, some of the best I have ever had in my life. Even a Danish traditional dish of grilled haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) was made in a sophisticated, tasty way which I initially thought could not work, but QR proved me wrong as it was delicious. My previous trip I rated only 7 out of 10 due to some faults and food and drink limitations. This trip was completely different and as close to perfect as it can be. Thus I have to rate it to the maximum, 10 of 10! Lounge in Doha (Al Mourjan) is very good despite I do not prefer these huge lounges (like factories). In BKK I used the Cathay Pacific Lounge which is simple and small but the lack of choices is not felt as food and drinks are well selected and light. Odd sized luggage arrived well in Hanoi and my luggage came out quickly. Excellent airline, everything functioned to perfection this time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-20;"This was my first time traveling on Qatar Airways, flying New York JFK to Amritsar via Doha. The crew was friendly and attentive. They smiled each time they interacted with me. The seats were comfortable and spacious and movie selection was current, with a great selection. The food was delicious. I've never flown on an airline in which dinner, snack, and breakfast were tasty and satisfying as on this flight. The connecting airport in Doha was huge, clean and impressive with a smooth transfer to my flight to Amritsar. The connecting flight and crew were excellent as well. I had a great 23 hrs flying experience with Qatar Airways. I would use this airline again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-16;"Johannesburg to Stockholm via Doha with Qatar Airways. Great service in business class, and the lie flat seats are truly 180 degrees. A genuine effort from cabin staff to cater for every whim of the customer, from welcome beverage to the 6 course meal with range of wines and spirits. My only niggle was that the AVOD selection for September was not as good as on my previous flights.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-15;"Expected a pleasant experience and that's exactly what we got on Qatar Airways during our flights from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. The flights were on time, hard working staff, and there were plenty of drink runs through the cabin. The A330 aircraft was older but was well maintained, the second leg on a newer A340 was better. The AVOD not as good as Emirates, the quality and quantity of the food was still good.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-14;"Qatar Airways offer a great daily service from Clark Airport, and is one of the few airlines to do so - which is a pity as Clark is a dream to travel from compared to congested NAIA in Manila. Easy check in, I was travelling with my partner and 3 year old son. Sponge Bob toys were offered to my son, and he was a happy flyer.  Qatar Airways was adequate in economy but other than the very competitive fare there was nothing I could not put my finger on anything to differentiate in their economy service. The fact they flew from Clark was their stand out point, followed by the very competitive fare.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-14;"London to Abu Dhabi via Doha on Qatar Airways. They let us use the Business area to check in. Onboard the flight, crew were smiling and respondent.  Seats were very comfortable.  Finally, they have mood lights, which is a positive. Food was delicious. Transit was around 2 hours. Doha Airport has lots of things to be done in it. Shopping areas to playing, with Macs in the middle of the airport for free. Internet in airport was 15mb/s and upload was 17mb/s. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-12;"We recently flew Athens to Perth via Doha on Qatar Airways which was superb. Check in in Athens was quick and friendly. The smaller A320 on the Athens-Doha leg only had recliner seats for this 4 hour flight. Service and quality of food and wine excellent, the seat comfort adequate for 4 hours. The lounge in Doha is very impressive with comfortable seating, good food and drinks. Doha to Perth had a Boeing 777 which was very comfortable. Despite a full cabin the service was top notch and probably one of the best I have experienced. The food is available on demand and beverages of high quality. The flat bed with mattress was very comfortable to sleep on. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-08;"HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH in Qatar Airways business class. Threee different aircraft types all fairly new, well-kept, and well-functioning. All flights on time. FA's hardworking, focused, and up to the game. Quality of catering is different, no lunch was served DOH to CPH despite arriving afternoon 2pm. Champagne quality is lower and beers offer 3 options.  No cheese or olives offered HAN-BKK. Other sectors the cheese choice was only 3, compared to 5 on previous flights. Eating on demand is a good idea. Too many annoying PA's promoting Qatar as tourist destination, too many commercials/charity commercials made the IFE irritating. Business class was full or fairly full and the cabin attendants did a good job and were caring as usual. Bar on A380 is a scoop but could have bar-chairs.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-08;"Flew initially on the Boeing 787, the cabin, seat, service and food was excellent. Second leg was on the Boeing 777, service and food was equally as excellent. The Boeing 777 cabin and seat are not as new, but very good compared to other airlines I've flown. Hopefully Qatar will offer a standard product across the fleet in the future. I didn't try the wifi as I don't like paying for it when flying business. Lounge in Edinburgh is okay. Doha business class lounge is like no other lounges I've been in - it's massive, lot of choice of foods, catering to different needs. If you want to sit and eat, you can - if you want quick, light snack, you can - and if you just want sit relax with a drink there is plenty available to do just that.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-07;"Kuwait to Istanbul via Doha, and this was my first flight on Qatar Airways. It was an amazing flight, there was an awesome flight attendant on flight QR241 who was so enthusiastic and wanted to talk with passengers and help them.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-07;"Kansai to Paris via Doha return on Qatar Airways. All in all, a very good trip and as other people have stated, their catering is much like a restaurant than airline food. Used the new lounge at Doha Airport. No longer a separate building, but the lounge was huge. It must have been the size of ten tennis courts. The A380-800 on both trips and the A330-200 on the outbound trip was excellent. The only complaint is the A330-200 on the way back. The seat was very outdated compared to what we had on the outward flight, although the inflight catering was excellent as always. I think they need to deliver a consistent product.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-06;"Check in fast, the lounge in Cape Town is in a partner lounge with 16 other airlines. Boarding okay. Staff okay and pleasant enough although not a full cabin and got my food order wrong twice. Toilet was not properly clean when I used it. Doha transfer a dream, the Al Mourjan lounge is superb. The second leg on a Boeing 787 a total different experience. Fabulous cabin staff who were helpful. They helped me every way.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-04;"This was the second leg of a flight from Madrid to Bangkok on Qatar Airways. It is Doha to Bangkok, the Boeing 777-300ER which has a 2x2x2 seat configuration in Business Class. My seat was 2A which is a window seat. The is plenty of room in these seats. They have lie flat seats, tons of leg room, storage in front of you, large overhead compartments, cheerful flight attendants, great service. The seat has a large TV monitor where you can watch all kinds of first run movies - over 50 choices. Games, music, plenty to entertain you if you don't want to sleep. It is a night flight, quiet and dark, so easy to sleep. The amenity kit is excellent. They serve a snack and 6 hours later breakfast. The food was ok, beverages the usual, including alcohol. The plane was fairly clean, pillows and blankets are comfortable. The seats have a small, flexible reading light. I don't remember if they have plugs for your phone/computer, but I think they do. All in all, it was very comfortable for a semi-long flight - it is only a little over 6 hours. The best part of being in Business class is when you get off in Bangkok, you get to go through priority immigration and visa! I sped right through. I would definitely recommend Business Class, you get what you pay for.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-04;"Qatar Airways evening departure from Melbourne to Doha was on time and hassle free. Boeing 777 cabin very spacious, clean and quiet. Service attentive and friendly without being fawning. Great to have pyjamas and a lie flat bed. Doha Airport has bus transfers to terminal upon arrival, which is mildly annoying. It was a very quick transit time, so got a 20 minute refesh in the lounge, which looked great and was well staffed and serviced. Doha to Athens on an A330. Out of the four legs I had, it was the newest plane, but my least favorite - seating is tight and cabin crowded. Return to Doha from Athens on an A321, which had only angled seats but was more comfortable than A330. Being a 4-hour day flight also helped. Dinner was superb on this leg. Return to Melbourne was on time, and with comfortable lie flat Boeing 777 seats, I got a good nights rest. IFE in general was a bit hit and miss and the Boeing 777 screens were not the best. Overall though, Qatar Airways experience as good as any I have had.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-03;"Great service and attention on these Qatar Airways flights and maximum enjoyment in the fantastic bar on the A380. On the route from Doha to Madrid in Boeing 787, noteworthy is the wonderful work of the hostesses. Unbeatable, great care about the menu, the atmosphere in the cabin. Also perfect flight sector on July 31 from Madrid to Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-01;"Manchester to Riyadh via Doha. The food was good, seats were as expected, but flights to and from Manchester were full of children (as well as the short Riyadh flights), and sleep was impossible. They use an electronic menu, for which they interrupted the IFE for 30 minutes. Toilets were a mess.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-09-01;"I am not a frequent flyer, and it´s mostly short-haul. I wanted a bit of comfort during the flight and I was surprised to see Qatar Airways was the cheapest 1 stop option. The food and beverage selections from Copenhagen to Doha was excellent in a nicely equipped Boeing 787. Crew could have ben a bit more friendly at times. The exact opposite was the case from Doha to Seoul, where the food could have been better, but the crew were excellent and helpful. Seats and legspace were what you would expect from economy, but not too bad either as there was a free seat in our middle row in both legs of the flight. I did not check the Wifi connectivity as I did not want to pay for it. Overall a very pleasant experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-31;"Checked in online, but drop off check in at Muscat airport could not check my bags to my final destination (Sarajevo on Croatia Airlines flight from Zagreb). This gave me problems at Zagreb, because I was not allowed to collect my bag and check them to Sarajevo, since I did not have a Shengen Visa. Qatar Airways onboard service was good. The flight attendants were pleasant and I had a smooth transfer in Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-30;"I am travelling back from a month vacation in Phuket with my wife and two children.  When we travelled to Phuket in July we found our six year old daughter had no child meals booked. I had booked this online but it failed to register. The staff were apologetic on the plane and said they would sort the issue for when we returned in four weeks. When we arrived in Phuket we found one of our cases had not arrived. This delayed us at the airport while we had to sort this issue. On checking in online for the return journey we find our family split, with my son 20 rows back from the rest of us on the last sector. The check in staff tried to adjust this but could do nothing better than move him slightly closer.  We found our daughter had no child menu on the plane and appeared to be the only one that failed to get a child gift when they were handed out. We asked later and were told all gifts had been handed out. In Doha the airport doesn't have a Priority pass lounge. I know things happen in isolation and cannot be helped, but good customer services should do their best to make it up to their customers by making them feel wanted and needed. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-30;"Dubai to Kathamandu in J class. The great option with Qatar Airways is that they fly from DWC not DXB which is a superb option. Small airport, you are through from check in to the gate in literally 5 minutes same on the return airside to landside taxi rank. I find Qatar Airways a quality consistent airline, this trip was no different, flights on time, in all directions. DWC to KTM via Doha, staff all pleasant this was a red eye, so sleep was the main requirement but unfortunetly with the aircraft used was not an option. A320 on a 4.5 hour night flight with non flat seats does not make for a comfortable sleep zone. So this was a negative. Crew onboard generally are polite, efficient but have a feeling of being robotic, they don't know how to be personable with passengers. On all sectors there was no priority business check in or priority boarding, all aircraft were at remote stands. Food and beverage good - but fail to understand why Mezze and lamb are on every menu! Overall good but could do better.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-29;"My first flight from Cairo to Doha was nice, but not amazing. There was no priority boarding for business class from Cairo. The flight attendants were perfunctory with me (a single female student traveling), but lavished attention on the male travelers.  When the IFE malfunctioned before takeoff, I was tersely instructed not to touch the remote for 15 minutes, as if it were my fault. Thankfully, the excellent food and drink made up for the service. On arrival in Doha, everything improved. There was a separate waiting area to board the plane to Paris, my flight attendant was amazingly attentive and detail oriented - putting away my carry-on for me, explaining the menu and the seat, and asking me when I wanted to dine, and introducing herself to me by name. When I had my pre-landing meal, another flight attendant observed that I enjoyed my smoothie, and offered me another one, even though he wasn't my assigned flight attendant. That was the service I was expecting when I booked Qatar Airways. The seat and IFE on the A380 was better than any airline I've flown before. All of the Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings movies, and new releases were loaded, in addition to European, Indian, Asian, and Arab film selections.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-28;"I flew with Qatar Airways to Bangkok for the first time. Very good, new clean airplane. Pilots talk to you during the flight. The airhostess were absolute fantastic - they try to help you, feel like that is someone you can talk and ask help. The best food I have eaten in an airplane. Seats are very comfortable.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-28;"Trip with small (7 years) daughter. All very good flights, except narrow seats (I was in 10 row, so no problem with seat pitch, but even in window seat - slightly wider than middle - was narrow) in B787 (in B777 much, much better, even A320 was better) and the same children meals both ways from Doha (omelette with some sausage). Normal meal good (especially pancakes). This time no problem with IFE, but on B787 much fewer options than on B777. Very nice Cabin Staff on all 4 flights. Unfortunately in Doha 3 times there was bus to/from airplane but although B777 boarding take long time all flights was almost (one flight was 15 minutes late) on time. Good price. Really recommended.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-28;"I've traveled all my life with Turkish Airlines but I have now made my shift to Qatar after the last 2 flights with them: Food is just excellent, good taste and variety. Staff are very friendly, drinks are high quality wines and champagnes. Connection time is very good, boarding is taken care of very well. New Airport is also good and the lounge is first class. The only negative I can add is that Qatar should offer complimentary internet in Business Class.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-21;Excellent service on all flights. Some of the flights though were nearly empty (DOH-RGN/RNG-DOH and DOH-MXP) with only around 30% of seats filled. Excellent value for money.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-21;"It was my first time flying Qatar Airways. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient, the aircraft was modern and clean with great in-flight entertainment. Seats were of good comfort in economy with great leg room. My flight back to NYC, the customer service at BKK airport was excellent when I needed to pay for extra luggage. I chose Qatar Airways because it was the best fare at the time, now I look forward to flying with them in the future. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-21;"Singapore to Doha. Qatar Airways A350 business class is top-notch. A wonderful, quiet and nicely decorated plane. Windows seem to be larger than other aircraft. The seat is maybe a bit narrow but I got the single one which means a lot of privacy for some good rest and sleep. Cabin crew was excellent and so was the food. Restrooms are very nice and were kept clean throughout the entire flight. Have not given a try to onboard WiFi. Anyway, in my opinion this WiFi service should be free of charge for business class passengers. Doha to Venice onboard an older A330-200, but the service and food were just as great as the previous segment. The more I transit through Hamad airport in Doha the more I appreciate its modernity and huge business class lounge.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-20;"The business class seating on the Boeing 777 is not as luxurious as newer airplanes such as the A380 - however, it was a good experience overall. The cabin crew members were friendly and offered great service. The seating was comfortable and I was able sleep with no problems. The vegetarian meal was okay. The airport at Doha is big and wonderfully designed.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-17;"Mu family and I traveled from Saudi Arabia to our homeland, Brazil, on vacation. We are five - myself, husband plus three little ones, aged from 2 to 9 years old. My biggest concern would be to manage the demands of the kids during the long haul flights. To my surprise, not only have I enjoyed the hospitality and services provided by Qatar Airways, but also have my three kids. The entertainment system was great and kept them entertained for long periods of time. Child meal was excellent. And sleeping time was perfect for us, with horizontal reclining seats, operated by the kids themselves. I was able to read a whole book, enjoyed my meals at time of my convenience.  My husband enjoyed the trip as much as I did. I would like to register my high appreciation for such friendly cabin crew and ground staff - second to none. Hamad Airport in Doha is a must go one day during anyone's life.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-17;"Qatar Airways QR70 from Frankfurt to Doha Hamad International Airport on the new A350. Check-in at Frankfurt Airport was smooth and the Qatar Airways staff were friendly. I had chosen 29A for myself, which was extremely convenient. The cabin was airy and chilly (the way I like!), middle seat was vacant which gave me extra room to enjoy the collection of movies and music on the IFE. A good collection of Hollywood as well as Bollywood movies, and songs encompassing all genres was a treat. The seats looked new and the cabin was very clean. I had ordered a Hindu non-vegetarian meal for myself, which was surprisingly palatable, especially the chicken curry with the coconut base. Service fantastic, I was in the mood for some Ginger Ale, and the stewardess was extremely polite and kind enough to serve it to me within no time. I highly recommend the A350 flight on the FRA-DOH route";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-17;"Doha to Frankfurt was delightful on the brand new Airbus 350, well superior over the so called Dreamliner. Service, seats and punctuality outstanding. The new Hamad Airport in Doha is by far the best in the Middle East. Return flight was a different story. last minute change to an aging A330-300, flight was overbooked and due to the different seating configuration, lots of dramas at the gate because seating allocation had to change for almost everyone. Due to the chaos, flight departed late, and I almost missed my connecting flight from Doha to Abu Dhabi. Overall a good product, well superior over Etihad Airways, who charges a premium for very mediocre seats and services.";POSITIVE

I did not travelled Qatar airways since almost a year and they improve their services with the new airport in Doha.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-15;All flights were on time or early. Good seat pitch on both aircraft with good entertainment and plentiful food. Cabin Crew excellent on the A330 on both legs but the staff on the A380 a little less friendly and attentive.

I would not hesitate to use Qatar again and will check out their website prior to booking flights.;POSITIVE

The cabin crew were very good, handled crying babies perfectly. Catering was average. In DOH had to take bus to terminal. DOH-SIN on the A350, I found seats uncomfortable. Cabin staff were not doing a great job. There was only a panini snack served after departure. . They start with the first meal 2 hours after take-off and the second meal 2.5 hours before landing!  I enjoyed the generous luggage allowance and good work of ground service. Not a 5-star experience. There was inconsistency between the flights. DOH-SIN had a paper menu, WAW-DOH an electronic one which was displayed after crew started serving food. WAW-DOH gave no toothbrush, earplugs etc. DOH-SIN had plastic cutlery v metal cutlery for WAW-DOH.";NEGATIVE

As we had pre-booked a safari and in order to connect to a flight from Doha to Kili, we were compelled to change our arrival time to 22nd July resulting in two additional nights at our expense. The flight was good. Plenty of leg space on the aircraft (economy) and very friendly and helpful staff. Excellent food (unlike Qantas where food served to Economy Class passengers on Qantas has been reduced). Return flight was via Doha and Hong Kong – the flights with Qatar Airways was good in all respects.";POSITIVE

Codeshare worked well and I'll be back in Qatar!";POSITIVE

Excellent buffet choice and champagne cocktails to start off our holiday. Onboard we were shown to our seats and greeted by name. A380 is very quiet and the business seats are amazing.

Totally happy with Qatar Airways and will be booking with them again.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2015-08-05;"Edinburgh Airport is a bit of a joke at present. Massive queues breaching out of the entrance with staff not having a clue who is coming and going. The security queues are worse and a bigger joke (being business class I avoided them through FastTrack). Once making my way to the Qatar counter, it was fantastic from there onwards. Check-in of our luggage was smooth, the aircraft departed on time. Seats in the Boeing 787 are at a funny angle but very comfortable and true lie-flat. Meals were well presented and not stodgy. IFE was excellent, perhaps not as good as Emirates. The cabin crew were excellent with attention to detail and sometimes a bit too nice. The Doha business lounge is very good. Not busy and a decent selection of food (although some of it was pretty lukewarm). Boarding onwards to the Singapore flight (again the Boeing 787) was seamless and the FA were again fantastic and dished out pyjamas to sleep in. On arrival, we literally were out within 10 minutes and had our suitcases with a further 10 minutes. Pity Qatar doesnt fly from Glasgow!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-03;"All flights were on time or early, you can't ask for better than that! Meals were plentiful and very tasty, a good selection of drinks brought around and if you want anything else, just call the flight attendant who were often up and down answering the calls.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-02;"Flight from JFK-DOH was on 777. Seating was 3-3-3 and did not feel cramped for a 6ft, 250lb man. DOH-COK was on A330. Food was ok on both legs. Flight from COK-DOH was good with no issues. DOH-JFK was very good. Flight attendants were very attentive. Flight from DOH to JFK was excellent. Food on both legs this time was excellent. Good selection of entertainment provided. I would take Qatar in the future. Compared to US airlines, there is no comparison. The total package of comfort, service, food and entertainment for the price paid can not be beat.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-01;"Excellent comfort and food, which is served on demand during the flight. The seat converts into a flat bed at the press of a button. The seat and the pillow was ultra-comfortable. Passengers are given a set of pyjamas for red-eye flight and amenities from Giorgio Armani in a pouch. Service, however, can be improved as it is not consistent. I had to wave to get the attention of the flight attendant as no one had attended to me for more than 5 min after the attendant light was turned on. I also had to remind the flight steward to collect my glass prior to take-off. No one reminded me to stow away my tray table prior to landing.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-08-01;"Truly amazing. World's best airline for a reason. Great service, lots of extras provided, on time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-28;"I was extremely disappointed on this flight QR836, 28th July 2015. During boarding there was only one crew member attending to 8 customers, it seemed one side of the aircraft was forgotten. I had to ask 3 times for pyjamas before going to the galley to get some. Cabin Services Director didn't bother introducing herself to me when distributing the wifi vouchers. She was very curt and at times I had the perception that she was going through the motions. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-28;"Great experience from check in at the airport, to arrival. The best business class product in the market. FA give the best service. Doha new airport is efficient and nice to walk around. On board Qatar Airways has great seats, nice food, great IFE. My bags arrived first on belt.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-23;"I traveled from Kuwait to Kochi via Doha return. At the time of booking I opted for Vegan meal, it food made of dairy products at both the occasions ( Doha-Kochi-Doha). The response of cabin crew was initially poor due to the lack of information about vegan food, though they apologised. On the next journey they compensated by offering additional fruits. Other than food, my flight experience was satisfactory, smooth check in, on time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-22;"We chose Qatar Airways for our trip to Phuket for our honeymoon. Our experience with one word: Excellent. Flight clean, staff friendly, service excellent and seats very comfortable. Ground service very good, and activities in Hamad International airport sponsored by Qatar airways was really nice. The onboard entertainment system was really good (especially selection of movies) games ok. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-22;"Had a two hour flight from Karachi to Doha. Flight attendants introduced themselves and told us to call them for any assistance. For such a short flight, the seats were fantastic! 180 degree flat bed seats, and very comfortable in an upright position as well. After a smooth takeoff, meals were served. Good breakfast however a family member of mine was informed that they had run out of the breakfast meal she wanted. This was quite disappointing as there were only 6 people in business class and Qatar cannot be known for great food if they run short of them. Other than this, the entertainment system was one of the best, the lighting in the aircraft gave the environment a very comfortable feel and the service was excellent. The attitude of the cabin staff was extremely polite and respectful. Overall, a great experience and hope to travel with them again";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-20;"Return flight of outward flight 2 weeks ago. What a difference in two weeks. The A340-600 is not a comfortable plane in business, but the food was outstanding, more like a Michelin Restaurant than a plane. The plane A7-AGC, was a little tired, IFE a bit hit and miss. The A330-200 from Clark to Doha had the new business class seats, fully flat unlike the outward journey. The food was excellent again. Has Qatar changed its chefs in the last two weeks. All journeys were on time and both arrived early. The lounge in Doha was fairly quiet, but again great service.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-19;"Our flight started with waiting on a bus for over 10 minutes. In our seats (Row 11) the lights were not working. The movies start with long ads, and breakfast chicken sausage was hard. The sink in one of the toilets was blocked.";NEGATIVE

BUD-DOH with A-321, DOH-BKK with Boeing777 ER, for 2 adult, 1 child and 2 infant the whole trip costs 1706 USD on economy class. The ground services and cabin staff was perfect, the inflight entertainment system worked well, food and the drinks was fine. There was not delays, the check in counters opened 3 hours before the flight. I would be flying with pleasure with them again. I can recommend them.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-15;"Great flights - a la carte dining with excellent food. Lovely staff throughout and good comfortable beds when reclined! Transfer easy, lounge was lovely although not well signposted, weird queuing system at bottleneck area near escalators. All in all great and same price as cx premium economy and I got a lot more for my money!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-14;"The only less positive comment I can make is at the check-in procedure at the OR Tambo Airport in Johannesburg. Check-in opens quite late, then, having purchased my ticket by Credit Card, an extremely long procedure for verifying the same is initiated, requiring my card and my passport to be taken to the office, while we wait at check-in.  Business Class lounge at the airport is quite modest - not at Qatar Airways level. On the plane, everything is positive, from the quality of the seat to the attentive, omnipresent service, to the dinner and breakfast served. Flight on their 787 is exceptionally smooth, one almost regrets that the flight is too short (around 8 hrs). ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-13;"A few years ago, I took advantage of a special offer from London with Qatar Airways in economy class, and was impressed with the standards of service then. Now that they fly from Edinburgh, I decided to give them another try, and I wasn't disappointed. From the minute we arrived at check-in, we were made to feel welcome. Similarly at boarding, the staff were attentive and wishing people a pleasant flight. On board the Dreamliner, the business cabin is superb. Each lie-flat seat is positioned so that it's like a little personal oasis, and is comfortable, fully adjustable, and with lots of little cubby-holes for your bits and pieces. You're also supplied with rather good noise-cancelling headphones, and an Armani amenity kit. These are waiting for you when you arrive, and they have different packs for male and female passengers. Pre take-off drinks are also served. The service on-board is impeccable - there's one flight attendant for four passengers, and the food is excellent. The menu is extensive and you can choose any items, as and when you please. The plane itself was smooth and quiet, and the attendants ensured that the toilets were always clean and well stocked. Despite a short 45 minute connection time, I was impressed by the new Hamad International airport, where we were whisked through security for our ongoing connection. I would thoroughly recommend Qatar Airways and it will be my airline of choice for future trips, even though Glasgow airport is more convenient for me.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-13;"Good flight on first leg. Used the BA lounge in PHL which is underwhelming. Quick boarding and attendant was pleasant and proactive in our cabin. Served a chilled drink and towel and orders taken for lunch. They emphasise the fact that the meals are a la carte which means you can choose when you want to eat. The food was well presented visually but lacked flavour and I had to send back an over cooked chicken dish. There is a good wine selection. The seats on the 772 are spacious and are laid out in a 2-2-2 fashion. IFE was just okay, nothing special. They supply you with pyjamas, slippers, amenity kits and a thin 'mattress', duvet and pillow. I can't fault the service but the planes need a remodel in terms of the seat and configuration. The downside is the washrooms which in my opinion are no different from J class washrooms. The next sector was on an A332. Terrible seats, limited storage areas and no USB port! Again food was well presented but underwhelming in terms of what you pay for. All planes left on time. I would recommend this airline if the price is good for a C class cabin but interiors need upgrading.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-12;"First time for my wife and I flying international, so we didn't know what to expect. Qatar Airways made us quite at home for our 20 hour flight. Food was plentiful, even to the point of over eating. We had a delay out of Philly due to rain, and with a short layover in Doha, we did not know if we'd make our connecting flight. Immigration was super fast, and they held the plane for us, though we literally got to the gate with 0 seconds to spare. All but 1 leg of our trip was about sold out, but the flight was not unbearable. We are in the process of booking our return to Phuket for 2016, and Qatar Airways is the airline of choice!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-09;"Both routes used the same plane. Service and food was poor out of Manila Clark, but DOH-LHR route food was significantly better. Only issue is that the A330-300 seats are not flat bed like the Boeing 777, very difficult to sleep without feeling you are sliding off. Ground staff were good in Clark and solved a connection issue. Both flights in business about 50% full. IFE was fairly average. No Pyjamas given out and quality of amenities gone down especially the eye mask.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-09;"After near perfect flights on the outward sectors to the UK, QR slipped up on the return. Having decided which movie to watch after lunch, not one of the new movies had been loaded onto the 787's IFE system - even 8 days after the start of the month. I then looked at the classical selection of the music channels. These are distinctly second rate in terms of choice - and not all are classical. IFE is one area where QR can definitely improve. Prior to take off on the second flight from Doha to BKK the FA asked about meal choices, reminding me the meal would served on demand as is QR's custom. I made it very clear I wished to sleep as long as possible on the 6 hour flight requesting merely orange juice, coffee and a croissant just prior to descent. We agreed this would be served one hour prior to landing. I was then awakened, raised my chair, threw my eye mask and ear plugs into the side bin as my orange juice was served only to realise there were in fact 2 hours of the flight remaining. The first comment was ""we are arriving early!"" which was not true. The second was that it was assumed I would need time to freshen up! Both inexcusable! On going to the aft toilet to change, the basin was clogged with filthy water and unusable. Then on asking for the complex landing cards required in Bangkok, I was informed they had not been loaded at Doha since they had had no stock for a week. Yet with 4 daily flights to/from BKK, surely the world's best airline could figure out a way to get a stack of them back to Doha!";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-09;"I was looking for an alternative to Etihad, with its high fares and declining service. The extra 2 hours via Doha were not an issue, considering the much lower fare, the great spanking new A350, great service and food and free German rail ticket, which is included in the ticket price. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-08;Me and my wife flew from Mumbai on 6th July to New York via Doha. Both ground as well as flight staff were very courteous. All meals served onboard were of a high quality and wholesome. Looking forward to our return journey on 22nd August from New York JFK.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-07;"I flew on their Boeing 787 from Cape Town, South Africa to Doha, Qatar. Check-in was quick and easy and we got through security without a hitch. Flight was delayed by 10 minutes because the food was late, but we made up that time during the flight and landed 30 minutes early. The crew was excellent, even with the flight full. Food and drink was kept flowing and was plentiful. Entertainment was excellent as well, seat was a bit small, but I am 6""2. Doha is a beautiful airport and I would definitely recommend Qatar to whoever wants good service, cheap flights and a good time.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-06;"This was my return leg to Brussels via Doha on Qatar business class. The first leg was on their 777-300 which after flying out on the 787 and A380 could not be as good, how wrong. The cabin is very spacious and like First class on other airlines. The seat arrangement is 2-2-2 with massive seats, about a metre of leg room/standing space and wide aisles. The seats are much more comfortable, especially in lie-flat than the new seats on the 787, A380 proving that older can be better. The service was excellent and all the staff new our names. There's a free Armani gift for male and female which are placed on the right seats before boarding, a nice touch. The food and drink options are not too impressive but I was quick to order as they ran out of some choices on our outbound flights. The second leg was on the new 787 Dreamliner. The seat arrangement is 1-2-1 but there's not as much room as on the 777 and not as comfortable as I discovered when I tried to sleep, this was an overnight leg. They provide a very thin mattress, a very comfy pillow and a nice blanket if you want to sleep, plus eye cover and earplugs are in your Armani gift set. I skipped the main meal as I'd just eaten in the lounge but I had the breakfast which was nice, with real cappuccino and fresh orange juice. All 4 legs (including my outbound) were on time with good service, overall a good first impression of Qatar after flying several times on Emirates.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-06;"Departed BKK on time at 02:40. In flight service was immaculate, superb dinner and wines (3 white and 3 red) served as and when requested, pajamas handed out and flat bed seats as comfortable as any in the air. Doha is a joy for transit passengers who do not have to bother with yet another security check. Lounge is huge with extensive facilities. The second flight was my first on a 787 and I was surprised - I found the experience less enjoyable that the 777. The herring-bone flat bed seat 1-2-1 layout seemed more cramped and I found no advantage in all the hyped up Dreamliner benefits. Still I slept much of the way. Arrived on time! For price, comfort, connections and the joy of not having to cope with Heathrow, Qatar Airways is almost impossible to beat";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-06;"I recently flew to Bangkok from Brussels via Doha with Qatar in Business class. The main reason was price as they had a genuine buy one get one free companion sale and it was only £925 each when it was over £1800 from London. Check in was good but they share the British Airways Lounge, I've seen a lot of 1 out of 10's for British Airways on this site so enough said. The first leg was on the Qatar Airways 787 Dreamliner, the seat arrangement is 1-2-1 with only 5 rows so quite exclusive. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat bed style, fully remote controlled, with a big TV, desk, pull-out table, pillow etc and a nice welcome pack of eye cover, ear plugs, lip balm and some nice Armani products. The staff are excellent as to be expected from Qatar Airways but the menu and drinks options were not too impressive. However my wife enjoyed the pink champagne and I enjoyed their signature lime and mint juice pre-flight drinks. The inflight drinks options were limited unless you like wine, lots of wine choice. They don't carry enough of each meal so my wife and I did not get our first choice as we were sat in the back row of 5 they'd ran out! The second leg was on their brand new A380 with business class on the top deck. The seats and arrangement is the same as the 787 just more rows. The icing on the cake and by far the best selling point is the bar. The hostess on bar duty was lovely and made everyone welcome. There was a good choice of drinks and bar snacks, especially the individual carrot cakes. You get a fast pass before landing to avoid the hour long queue at passport control but no free chauffeur service, come on Qatar. Your bags get priority so they're on the carousel before you get there. Overall a good first impression although I was on their newest aircraft, can't wait to fly the new A350.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-05;"Effective check-in and transferring. Cabin crew attentive and friendly. Very limited legroom, making the flight really uncomfortable when the flight is full as was the case on the BCN-DOH leg. I am a regular flyer and have found the legroom on all four flights to be exceptionally limited compared to other airlines. Serving of meals on the first two legs seemed disorganized. I was served my meal only two hours after the meal service started. On the second leg I received my meal relatively quickly, but the passengers sitting five rows ahead of me were only served about an hour later. I could not figure out the logic. Serving of meals on the return flights were well organized though.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-01;"Flew from Doha to London on QR 003, June 24th. Very impressive check in area. Al Mourjan Lounge offered an a la carte options as well as buffet. However, all the menus were based on egg options during the breakfast. It was below what I expected. Qatar should have provided extensive options to their premium passengers based on the fact that these are passengers who are transitting through Doha and have travelled from all over the world within a 24hrs time zone. On baord service was excellent. You can choose your own time to be served. Compliments to the crew and purser who addressed every single customer by name. The seats lacked privacy and were not comfortable for sleeping. It was very narrow and my knees kept hitting the tray table everytime I tried to move to a different position. The same type of seats are also offered on their B787 and A350 aircarft. It was fine for a day flight, and also for lounging and working, but I would avoid this type of seats for a night flight. I had the best sleeping experience on their B777 aircarft. IFE system was ok. Menu options were limited and the quantity are so small. Onboard lounge served Krug Champagne even for JC passengers. However, things which are lacking on Qatar Airways for their FC and JC passengers are, the free limousine, free wifi on A380, and the extensive menu options both at their Al Mourjan Lounge and on board the aircarft compare to their comppetitor, Emirates. However, I would still choose to fly on Qatar Airways since they are a member of One World Alliance and based on their on board service experienced.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-01;"I have to say that Qatar airways lounge at LHR is out of this world, the food is 5 star. The food and drinks on the flights were excellent, the crew could not do enough for me. I only had a very brief visit to their lounge in Doha, but what I saw was very good, my only gripe was that they used buses to and from the planes on both flights in Doha. Qatar Airways London assured that airbridges would be used, especially as they now had a brand new airport, so it looks as if they haven't been informed about them still using buses or they don't want to tell you. As I am 82 years old I find it difficult walking up and down those stairs carrying two cases. Hopefully on my return flight in September, they will use airbridges , I'll have to wait and see. Except for that minor thing, I would have given them 10/10, but I can only give them a 8/10";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-07-01;"Was curious to try Qatar, having flown Emirates numerous times between S Africa and Europe. Qatar's pricing is a major draw-card, they were significantly cheaper than Emirates. The trip out of JNB to DOH was great, the plane was not full and a lot of passengers had spare seats around them. Not sure that it would have been as pleasant with a full plane. Having heard so much about the Boeing 787, I was expecting it to be state-of-the-art flying, but I can't say that was the case. The seats are as hard  and very cramped - these seats rate very poorly against the Boeing 777, and the only way I could grab any sleep was by sleeping against the window. The food was really good, and I love the containers they use - much better than any other airline I have flown with recently. Entertainment is great - the range is not quite as extensive as Emirates or BA, but streets ahead of Turkish Airlines. One gripe is that the crew would only serve one drink with dinner, I couldn't have a pre-dinner drink and a glass of wine. Thought that was rather mean. The flight between Doha and Istanbul was also good, despite it being a full flight on a narrow body aircraft. Return flight was great too, my only gripe is that every leg of the journey entailed a bus to get to the terminal building, and another back out. That would be okay if you weren't left in the 38 degree heat. Other than that, I can't fault Qatar.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-29;"Flew from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Doha. I took advantage of a great introduction fare as this is a new route for QR. From and to AMS is with the Dreamliner. The flight to and from BKK with the Boeing 777-300ER. Qatar Airways provides a good service in economy, all flights were on time and the transit at the new Doha airport was painless. They have to work on their inflight entertainment system though, as it is a rather clumsy and unresponsive design. That was really the only issue, for the rest inflight service was good. Some reviewers complain about the limited legroom and uncomfortable seats on the dreamliner but I found both to be adequate. As long as Qatar Airways offer competitive fares they will be on my shortlist for trips to Asia.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-29;"Overall flights punctual, staff super friendly. Flights good, Boeing 787 a great aircraft, food ok, lamb which I don't like. Why when transiting do you have to back through security again? Lounge very flashy and impressive but service slow to non existent. I not change the reservation online, called Johannesburg call centre again can't change, tried calling Doha told to do it at the airport. Ticketing at airport again no chance. J class ticket ?  Overall I like the crew in the air, but will think again if the food and ground ops are ongoing.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-28;"Arrived for check in slightly late - large queue so Business desk was opened for me - very friendly check in staff at LHR. Enjoyable flight on Qatar Airways, friendly staff and good service. A drink not long after departure, drink with the meal and a post dinner drink (including good quality Armagnac) plus drinks on request. Champagne was offered in economy - not the most common offering and a welcome change from other airlines who often only offer red/white wine and beer for economy passengers. Comfortable seats with a good range of English, International, Arabic programmes meant the flight was more than tolerable. Food a little highly salted - offerings were chicken/beef with rice/potatoes, nothing ground breaking but nothing to complain about either. Only negative was that like most Gulf airlines it's lacks character - something I enjoy when flying with flag carriers.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-28;"After a wonderful flight on a B777-300ER this was a bit of a downgrade I must admit, smaller seats and awful quality VOD.  However food and drink service was solid. Cabin crew a little less friendly than the previous flight and facilities more dated, but more than tolerable. Good selection of drinks - spirits and champagne in economy again. Far from the worst but not the best.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-27;"The plane was boarded well in time however the computers had to be rebooted and the flight left 10 minutes late but time was made up anyway. Keeping in mind that Qatar Airways has been voted #1 in the world it is hard to find fault with anything. My only comment would be that over 5 hours is a long way to fly in a narrow body jet. Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha. And for most sectors out of Entebbe (Uganda) Qatar offer the best price, which makes them unbeatable really unless you want a direct flight to Western Europe.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-26;"Flew the A380. Boarding was very efficiënt and shortly after take off drinks and meals were served. So there was enough time to sleep for the remaining flight time. I decided to get a last drink in the lounge. There I had a wonderful reception by the crew, who were nice to chat and pamper for the rest of the remaining flight. I did not sleep a wink, but had my best flight experience ever! Qatar Airways serves an outstanding business class product with incredible good seats and the lounge on the A380 as an absolute extra, but at the end of the day it are the people who are working for Qatar, who make it a 6 star rating.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-26;"Dallas to Doha economy class, and passengers were mostly not beef eaters, but one of the main dishes offered was beef. Maybe the airline should look at other food choice options. Overall very satisfied with the service provided by crew and the inflight entertainment. Qatar deserves to be the world best airline. Meal options are not the fault of crew, but just a suggestion.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-24;"My second trip with Qatar Airways, last time had the older A330 aircraft. What a difference this time! The B787 seats are not as good as A380, but okay for the shorter flight to Doha. The window shades in this 787 aircraft are rubbish, and they do not block out the sun as was promised when Boeing were advertising the benefits of the plane. The A380 was so much better, nice and spacious and seats very comfortable. IFE is not very different to Emirates or Singapore Airlines that I flew last time, don't understand why everyone raves about Emirates because they just have a huge library of ancient, 2nd rate films. Food was good, not the best but certainly good for Economy cabin trip. Cabin staff were great on both flights, better for DOH-BKK where they were chatty and friendly. Return in 10 days flying out of Singapore and looking forward to getting on their A350 I have read so much about. Definitely recommend Qatar Airways with these new planes, and service seems to have improved from before.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-24;"Singapore to Miami. The Boeing 787 seats appear good for children and small females but an adult male will be uncomfortable. The first thing to do is relocate the Media box away from the under seat area. Having my one foot out in the isle was not only a safety hazard but not fun to be kicked and bumped into because I could not move my feet if placed under the seat. I was sitting next to a larger man who encroached into my seat space. I believe the seat is about 17"" across. Seat pitch minimal but no different to other airlines. Service was very friendly, top notch. Noticeably better than US airlines. Food was disappointing.  While the airline does offer superb service, I recommend against flying them in coach due to seat restrictions. ";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-23;This was a mix of business and economy. Business class SIN to DOH and Economy class thereafter. I was a little disappointed I wasn't able to have a pre-departure glass of Champagne due to customs regulations at Singapore. Once in the air I was able to enjoy a glass. The usual business class service from Qatar Airways was enjoyable even though the flight was bumpy all the way from SIN to DOH. The flatbed was comfortable and a sleepsuit was provided. Back in economy class for DOH to LHR leg. Nice service and the flight was empty so I was able to enjoy a row of seats to myself even if the IFE box was does restrict legroom.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-23;"I choose this route so I could fly the A350. The first sector was cramped on the B787 but the service and entertainment onboard was up to the usual standard for Qatar Airways. Once onboard the A350 the leg room and width of the seat was obvious. I was able to stretch out, without irritating my neighbour. The food portions in economy have shrunk but they're enough to keep you going on both these sectors which are just over 7 hours each. The entertainment system on the A350 is also superior to all the others in their fleet.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-22;"KUL-DOH-PHL-BWI. The A330-200 KUL-DOH outdated  with angled flat seats. Staff were pleasant but perfunctory. Food was reasonable, the wine list impressive and chocolates given out after dessert and coffee. Boeing 772LR from DOH to PHL was much better, more spacious and better seat width. Catering was on demand and staff were warmer this time around and did their job splendidly, although they should chill champagne and white wine properly. The attendant laid out the flat bed on the 772 and provided all passengers with PJ's, a comfy pillow and a duvet. On all flights, the toilets were kept clean, food was served warm, good brewed coffee served and the in flight entertainment was adequate. Great multinational crew which is a plus with this airline. I would highly recommend this airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-18;"I had high expectations, but at the end of the day all 4 flights were just average. Seat comfort more or less like everywhere. Ground service in Doha friendly but not interested. Crew on board was always friendly. Food was nothing to remember. Stopover in the middle of the night at Doha Airport and arrival to Abu Dhabi at 03.55 is also nothing too fancy. All in all: an on time, average economy experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-18;"TIF DOH BKK, 10th June - Qatar remains my favorite airline and is way above the rest. TIF-DOH First class. I told the flight attendant what I wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice, assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all I got was I had selected from that section none of the other items came. The lounge in Doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. DOH-BKK Business Class, the crew apart seemed disinterested. Some passengers had finished their meal before others had started.  I guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as I usually am. All in all OK service and flight. But Qatar normally is above OK and exceptional. I put it down to a bad day for both them and me. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-16;"First time traveller on Qatar Airways. We travelled in the business class cabin and as a frequent business class BA flyer I was amazed! It was much better than British Airways and cheaper! The seats are very comfortable with plenty of space and storage space. The TV was big and HD. The choice of films, TV, games and music is very good. The food choice and quality was really good. It was middle eastern based and included appetisers, starters, mains, deserts and a choice of breads. All in all we were so impressed. the stewardesses were attentive, polite and efficient. We will definitely be flying Qatar Airways again!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-16;"Overall our experience was decent however there were a few things that put a damper on experience. From Athens to Doha my husbands screen didn't work and only towards the end of flight did the air hostess offer for him to change seats. She kept on forgetting to help and by then he had cut losses and tried to sleep. We also had a 10 hour stopover. All my family who have had long stopovers had been given complimentary hotel rooms. For this reason we decided to book on Qatar. As the time got closer I mailed to ask about this, the staff replies were short, rude and unhelpful. The told me all the places we could pay to stay at, which we had not budgeted for. So we had a horrid stopover at airport. Second time using Qatar and this will be my last. With that said their South African office was friendly and nice.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-16;"Flew 5 June and back from CPH on 13 June routing HAN-BKK-DOH-CPH-DOH-BKK. HAN-BKK in B777-200. BKK-DOH in A380. DOH-CPH in B787. Excellent experience throughout. All flights on time. Staff alert, attentive and productive. Service and drinks world top class. Food amount and quality is significantly slipping but still acceptable. Because QR has recently done a lot of promotional sales, business class cabins are now full or almost full. However, service was still exhibited well and focused. I rate the B777-200 business class seat and cabin comfort high. However, the best seat and cabin among the 3 aircrafts tried was the A380: almost noiseless and with the luxury bar on the upper deck. FA tend not to chat with each other and keep themselves busy making a true effort comforting the pax – they are friendly and talk positively with most passengers. That’s the way! Of all sectors above only the DOH-CPH was in economy, of course a different ballgame with a slimmer hardware and software - but altogether the rating became equally high. Worst on the 787 is the extreme compacted seating which must be among the heaviest packed economy in the world – not much dreaming on that part of the Dreamliner, now I understand the nickname “Nightmare-liner”: If the person in front of you reclines you are forced to do the same unless you close your tray-table! In contrast, the following sector back from CPH-DOH was in the Dreamliner aircraft’s business class which offered a superb odysse, but still a bit below that of QR’s A380. Business class full but staff managed very well, high degree of attention and service. Al Mourjan lounge in DOH clearly 5 star, though too big to my taste. Lots of food in either buffets, a la carte. The bar on 1st floor offered 3 different, prestigious champagnes (I just checked and saw the bottles). From DOH-BKK in A380: faultless, quiet, lots of service and talkative FA’s. I could have all 3 options of hot meals, but limited myself to vegetarian and chicken. Quality of food deteriorates a bit. Slept well. Ground-staff assisted me catching my next flight on a difficult time-constrained connection by a Low Cost Carrier, though actually not QR’s problem. Thanks, QR!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-16;"MEL-DOH-BAH. The journey back to Bahrain from Melbourne was an awful experience. Flight QR905, June 6th was delayed 45 mins. Ground staff at the gate were not sure what was going on and it seemed organized chaos as a lot of passengers were complaining quite profusely. There was no specific lane for business class passengers to board,something that was quite obvious on my trip through Hamad Airport going to Melbourne on QA904 on the 21st May. Problems start on QA905, once in the air on a 14 hr flight you want to relax and have creature comforts. It involves the inflight entertainment system. I started watching a movie once we had taken off after the 45min delay. A passengers IFE was not working so the chief steward was trying to help fix it but sadly he did not inform others that he was going to shut down the IFE for a reboot. My screen suddenly went off as it did for a number of other passengers. This rebooting was tried 3 times then the chief steward just said we can’t fix the problem. This is unacceptable in my book, no portable DVD players were available like you have on Gulf Air, Singapore Airlines and Silk Air as a back up. The system is very fragile indeed and many headphones were not working or only working in one ear. I had to change out 2 headphones to get to hear proper sounds. The next flight 7th June, Doha - Bahrain on QR1121 was just as bad. 55 minutes delay and gate C-28 was just utter chaos. Appalling organization by Qatar ground staff at this gate who again were not that customer friendly. The special lane for business class passengers was not even open and we were lumped in with everyone else. The next time I travel to Melbourne I shall not be using Qatar.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-15;"Flew ZRH-CGK via DOH return onboard B787 and B77W. 3 out of 4 flights arriving/departing DOH were using busses instead of Aerobridge. Not so good for the huge new Hamad International Airport. Meals were all delicious but could be improved in term of quantity. Entertainment onboard were nice, responsive and easy to navigate (It surely great for Indian pax, as it has a lot of Indian contents!). Inflight connectivity works. Cabin service were superb. Crew were genuinly friendly and efficient on all 4 flights! For the price I paid, I will definetly choose Qatar Airways again in the future. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-15;"The first time I flew with Qatar Airways.  The aircraft was new, with a great entertainment system, big screen in each seat, many options of movies, series, tv shows, musics, etc. The seat had a good pitch and it was comfortable to sleep. The service aboard was relaxed and very good. Some attendants were serious and unfriendly and we had many interruptions with cabin calls and advertising, it stopped the movie I was watching many times. I will fly with Qatar Airways more times for certain.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-14;"On 3 out of 4 occasions bussed to plane at Doha rather than using airbridge. This is difficult to comprehend at the huge new Hamad airport. Delayed departure from Abu Dhabi meant late arrival and fear of missing connection. Had to run miles with inaccurate information on airport departure boards indicating flight was boarding when in fact it was delayed. Seat pitch seemed tight. No hot towels or menu cards, although the menu was shown onscreen through the inflight entertainment system. Meal was tasty enough but small portion sizes. Good selection of drinks, with free champagne (in economy).";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-14;"I am not normally a Business Class traveller but I got an amazing deal on Qatar Airways. So of course, I am ready and willing to be impressed. However, this was the most comfortable flight I have had. Attentive service from the flight attendants and a very comfortable and easy to operate seat. The B787 is in a class of its own.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-14;"We had a 1 hour 30 minute transit and prior to this flight I was worried about missing the connecting flight or that our luggage would be left behind because of the short transit, but everything went well. Our flight Zagreb left on time, arrived Doha early and we left to Dubai just on time too! On our flight to Dubai the boarding was quick and easy. Flight was comfortable and food on board was yummy. The only downside to this was that, for our flight from Doha to Dubai, we weren't given any headsets for the inflight entertainment. I assume this could be due to the short flight duration. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"IAD-DOH, QR708, business class seat 6A. Check-in chaotic after a big storm in Washington which flooded the airports internal train and tunnel system, so all passengers for all flights put on Dulles' dreaded 'people movers'. Flight had 60 wheelchair passengers comprised mostly of those who think they get through security faster if being pushed around. FAs call these ones the 'miracle passengers' who then gamely run off the plane on arrival to get through immigration and customs. Other airlines that have started charging for wheelchair use without a medical certificate find that requests for wheelchairs drops about 90 percent. Full business cabin. Service and catering excellent. Made up time en route for late departure and landed in DOH almost on schedule.  ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"IAD-DOH-CMB-DOH-IAD, Business Class in B777-300ER. Check-in excellent at IAD, followed-by the use of the Virgin Clubhouse. Virgin reception staff rather uptight, but the dining area staff was outstanding. All four flight segments were not full, so I had an empty seat next to me at all times. This is a huge benefit, as although the seat has an outstanding pitch, is wide and very comfortable, it dates back to business class seating of a decade ago, with zero privacy between seats if you are travelling alone. A small bottle of water and a nice Georgio Amani amenity kit was awaiting my arrival, with a blanket, pillow and noise-cancelling headphones. Pyjamas and slippers were given out later on the segments to/from IAD. Staff service was very good on all segments and dine when you want service was good, though cutbacks are very evident in their menus. Of the four flight segments, QR 707 from DOH to IAD on 01 June had excellent crew serving the rear business class cabin where I was. Transit time was short at DOH, but the airport does not function logically, despite its showy architecture. Certainly no match for SIN and HKG. Check-in at CMB was efficient, and I used the UL Serendib Lounge due to my OW Emerald Tier status. Mid-week QR fare was very competitive, and provided very good value for money. Baggage delivery at IAD was much delayed, though probably not QR's fault. Will definitely use them again, especially as they are a OW member airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"Flew LHR to AUH via DOH return. Outbound on the 787,flight was full. Very claustrophobic, tiny seats, the service took forever. Flight left at 2130, it was nearly 3 hours later that I finally got a drink and something to eat. The meal was cold and when I pressed the call bell to try and get someone to heat my meal, I was ignored. Cannot believe on this evidence they are a 5 star airline. However coming back on QR5, it was like flying a completely different airline - friendly cabin crew, nice food, good service. Maybe it helped that the flight was half empty but what a difference. A330 a much nicer experience than the Dreamliner, wider seats, more legroom and just more comfortable. Doha airport in the afternoon was practically deserted, this is obviously a good time to depart.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"Milan-Doha on Airbus A330-300 and Doha-Guangzhou on B777-300. In my opinion, this is the best business class product out there on the market. Everything was perfect on both flights: tasty food (excellent presentation), excellent champagne. The dine anytime service is much appreciated. The seat, especially on the B777, is comfy. Very good amenity kit from Armani, the best noise cancelling headphones I have experienced on a plane. Entertainment system is good, even tho the choice of movies on the Milan-Doha segment was maybe too limited. What makes QR a 5-star airline is the cabin crew: extremely polite, friendly, smiling, very well groomed. As a Privilege club member, I was recognized by name on both sectors. Hamad International airport business lounge, huge but still crowded, is quite impressive. I do look forward to flying the A350 business product on my way back.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"This review is based on the B787 Singapore-Doha-Johannesburg vv flights and I suspect would be better with different aircraft. As others have commented, the B787 as fitted by QR is a major problem because of hard, narrow and just plain uncomfortable seats, which really is unacceptable for flights of seven to eight hours. This is such an issue as to overshadow other generally satisfactory aspects. I might fly QR again but not on their 787s.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"MEL-DOH-LHR-DOH-MEL, 777-300ER and A380. 4 flights and a mix of experiences. Qantas lounge in Melbourne is a dark dungeon and not particularly worth the visit. Boarding was pain free although cabin crew were not well versed when it came to assisting parents with two young children. In most cases on all flights I found all cabin crew friendly but unable to take the initiative to offer services. in most cases if you wanted something you had to ask instead of being offered. These were not lazy crew, they worked hard but they were just not polished crew used to premium service. First of the two business class cabins is the better of the cabins as it feels more spacious and open. Seats are lay flat and comfortable. Inflight entertainment is lacking with random titles from the 80's and not much more if you select the Hollywood option. Hamad Intl is great and the lounge is huge and fantastic. No one explains the options available to you and your left wondering what's on offer. Great flights and great lounges in Doha and London. Food is exceptional bit staff need more training though not because they disgruntled. One incident did concern me though. The A380 has a inflight bar which on one flight was serving up excessive amounts of alcohol to two passengers who subsequently were almost restrained in their seats by crew. Cabin crew really should have stopped serving the two passengers hours before. The only major issue on an otherwise great trip. ";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-13;"For someone who has become used to the standard European business class long haul (BA/Lufthansa etc), these middle eastern airlines are quite a revelation.  Much like the Cathay Pacific's of the worlds, these guys put the staid overpriced tiredness of the European airlines in perspective.  Business class on Qatar is, for example, certainly more than the equivalence of BA's first class. And at significant cost reductions. Part of it is the staff, you just don't get the level of service orientation on European airlines like BA and Lufthansa.  Its like there is no motivation to go beyond the standard, drummed in training they've done a hundred times. You know those adverts where you see the service crew gently put a blanket on a sleeping guest?  I had assumed that was rubbish, it had never happened to me.  Well it did with Qatar!  One of the staff even made a personal plan to get an out of stock duty free item to me!  Unreal stuff.  Or maybe this is how it should be?  And long  may it last, I hope these guys continue to put pressure on the old hens of the sky like BA and Lufthansa - the competition can only be good for the passengers.  Now if the transit times weren't there these guys would be the only ones I'd fly.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-07;"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-06;I flew to Thailand for my honeymoon with Qatar from Manchester to Doha and then on to Bangkok with the same transfer coming home. I have always dreaded long haul flights and never expected what I got with Qatar. It was excellent. Staff were lovely the plane was stunning and the flight was an enjoyable part of our holiday. I can't thank them enough. Due to the previous days wedding and traffic we were 15 minutes late for check in but they took care of us and rushed us on to the plane. I can't thank the staff enough but I will endeavour to make sure our next holiday destination is on a Qatar Plane.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-06;24 May LHR-DOH (010) DOH-DXB (1014). 29 May DXB-DOH (1023) DOH-LHR(005). Will keep this simple and say the 4 flights we had with Qatar Airways last week were the best 4 I've had or at least right near the very top (the first one LHR-DOH was unquestionably our best). All 4 flights left on time on the 2 long ones we got constant service on drinks and as well as the meal got 3 other food portions all of which were very nice. On the short 45 mins flight from Doha to Dubai we got a nice sandwich and cake with drinks was very satisfactory and wouldn't have wanted more. The service from the staff was excellent not just on the plane but at the airport all of them were very polite. The inflight entertainment was brilliant with a huge choice of recent releases TV shows etc. The toilets were clean and well kept. The only bug bear would probably be the box below the window seat which limits legroom I had no problem with it but I would imagine that some people might. Overall I enjoyed all the flights and would opt to choose them again next time.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-06-01;LHR-DOH-CPT-DOH-LHR QR004/QR1369/QR1370/QR009. My first time on Qatar however I've flown on average once a month over the previous 15 years mainly on the same 5 or 6 airlines premium or business with a few economy and first flights in between. I no longer travel for work longer interested in frequent flier miles or status either so looking forward to trying different airlines on my 3 or 4 holiday trips each year. Check in at T4 quick with seats honoured was able to use the sky team lounge through my FFP status - nice lounge. Boarding the new A380 was quick and organised seated upper deck I was impressed by the space seat and general ambience the best economy I've travelled in. Take off on time a very nice crew kept busy! Drinks and dinner offered. Dinner just ok connection in Doha went fine. Flights between DOH - CPT and return on new 787's I found the 787 noisy and not as comfortable as the A380 both flights on time again pretty good service from nice crews although food not that good. Had a longer connection in Doha on the return trip so gave me a chance to experience the new airport and business lounge which were very nice. Doha back to LHR on an ageing A340-600 which I found comfortable for the 6hr 20min flight!! crew fine food not that good however for the price paid I really cant complain some of the best economy flights I've had I'm looking forward to using Qatar business in around 2 months.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-31;23 and 28 May 2015: HAN-BKK (Business Class) and BKK-HAN (Economy) on a B777-300. Both flights on time the first took off 20 Minutes prior to scheduled and landed 30 minutes too early. Excellent service at check-in counters and full info on seat options provided. The new Business Class Lounge in Noi Bai T2 is new friendly and bright and provides an excellent view of lanes and planes. Several hot dishes presented I preferred the marinated fried fish and the beef stew. New cozy spacious shower rooms offered. A couple of small wild birds made the visit memorable and pleasurable they seem to have not only been bewildered into the airport but obviously settled there as I saw also 1-2 birds there a 2 months earlier. Business Class almost fully lie flat. Service on board top notch though food options limited on this short sector. They ran out of prawn salad when they came to my seat and option was only a hot snack plate nothing top brawl about. I could have as many as I wanted however. Denied my so much wanted cheese plate as this is not offered for short sectors (likewise no amenity kit). FA's were in a sparkling mood lifting the whole thing. Drink service quick and fairly frequent. Many drink options inc. three different champagnes and pre-take-off drinks offered. Economy class on way back was also about as good as it gets. Champagne provided on request. Staff in Economy are quite impersonal but do the job. In Bangkok QR uses Thai Airways lounges which are good but somehow I prefer the new Business Class lounge in Hanoi operated by NASCO. None of them have sparkling wine and Hanoi lounge offers only local wine.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-31;LHR B788 DOH A320 MLE and return. First QR flights. Service excellent and food / beverage quality above average. Seat pitch on B788 a bit tight for taller people but comfort otherwise ok. Entertainment system excellent. A320 definitely more roomy albeit a bit tired looking. Transfers at DOH both very short but airport design/ layout helpful ground staff and buggy availability (if needed) made the process trouble free. Luggage checked through to destination so no worries there. Will use QR again where available.;POSITIVE

We were given different seats even though we requested the seats together (both in KTM airport and Doha airport). The agent at the counters said that the seats were together but they were not. On our way to SEA from Doha I was given the 2 last seats and 1 in front of that. Not very nice seats to be given for someone who is travelling with a 5 year old child. Had 14 hrs of transit in Doha and no hotel was provided.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-27;QR702 JFK-DOH 777-300ER seat 1A. After boarding no one from the crew came to greet me offered me anything to drink sleepwear etc. It was odd and a bit like I didn't exist. The chief purser was not very friendly which is uncharacteristic for QR in its premium cabin. The dinner was good. My breakfast selection was overcooked and dried out. On-time departure and arrival. AVOD getting a bit tired especially the TV comedy selections.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-27;I am a BA Silver card holder and decided to try Qatar now they are part of the oneworld Alliance. We flew LHR to DOHA then onto Phnom Penh as the final outward destination. The flight from London to Doha was their new Business A380 seats. On board there was a bar where we sat enjoying a drink with other passengers. The crew service is excellent and the products provided. Also the meal on board was enjoyable so was their lounge in T4 Heathrow. Again service way above other carriers. On the return journey we flew on A330 and A340 which didn't have such good business seating. Crew were very attentive and the ground staff at Doha.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-25;SIN-DOH-IKA on B787 and A320 return SYZ=DOH-SIN on A320 and A350. Seats very comfortable except for B787. I am only 5 foot 4 but the entertainment box which is under both the aisle and window seats is terribly intrusive. It was my first flight on a B787 and while the quiet engines and improved humidity were a welcome change the cramped seats made it very difficult to sleep. Will avoid flying with Qatar on the 787 in future. Thankfully they have decided to switch to the A350 to Singapore which was an infinitely more comfortable flight. Crew on all flights were excellent and food was generally very good. Fantastic personal AVOD available on every flight except from DOH-IKA.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-20;PER-DOH-CDG and return. Just did Perth to Doha in business on a 777 and then Doha to Paris economy on the 380 and return the same way. All trips on time. We had a look at business class on the 380 but prefer the layout on the 777. Economy upstairs on the 380 was fine for the shorter journey. What was excellent was the service. Consistently very high standard from FA's. As Qantas gold members we chose Qatar over Emirates because there was several thousand dollars difference in cost for our package and Qatar still gave us One World benefits. Would not hesitate to choose them again. We used Qantas lounge in Perth which is not bad Air France premium lounge at CDG which has all the amenities of the QF lounge at Karratha and the Qatar lounge it Doha which is simply superb.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-20;DXB-DOH-BCN return. Overall a very poor flight in both segments: quite old Airbus A330-200 with noisy engines extremely cramped seats poor IFE awful food with small portions and quite inattentive to rude cabin crew both ways. Ground staff inattentive transfer at Doha is a mess. I will be happy to fly any other airline in the future.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-20;Flight MXP to BKK in November 2014. Both flights on schedule. The A330 from MXP to DOH was rather old and very few leg space. The B777 from DOH to BKK was rather ok but still I had the feeling that they reduced in this aircraft as well the leg space. Honestly I can't complain because I paid a very low rate. On the MXP-DOH flight staff made a mess with the meal requests I made during my booking. While serving food they told me the low fat meal wasn't available and they served me the normal meal. After 40 minutes an other hostess passed by to serve me the low fat meal. On the DOH-BKK flight everything was ok.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-20;Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-20;I flew CPT-DOH-FRA on B787/A350 (16 April 2015) and return LHR-DOH-CPT on A380/B787 (30 April 2015). All in all a massive disappointment. B787 is without doubt the most uncomfortable aircraft I have flown on and is to be avoided. Qatar Airways like most others have opted for the high density seating in economy of 3x3x3 instead of 2x4x2 for which the aircraft was designed. This results in horrendously narrow seats with poor pitch and legroom. Worst of all a hard metal entertainment box in the foot well of every window and aisle seats. The box takes at least one third of foot well space and forces ones feet close together if you wish to stretch out your legs. The metal box bites into the side of your shin and is painful and uncomfortable. The new Airbus A350 with a wider body and 3x3x3 is far better. More spacious more width and a less intrusive entrainment box in the foot well. A350 XWB wins hands-down in passenger comfort over it's rival B787. Food was average to abysmal on all sectors served lukewarm to cold. Drinks service okay and champagne and cognac a plus in economy class. On all flights the crew were friendly but surprisingly disorganised during meal service. Running backwards and forwards through the cabin to supply vegetarian meat and chicken dishes not correctly loaded in trolleys. There was a clear lack of effective communication between crew members during service. Cultural issues perhaps as the staff are a multinational mish-mash from all over the world. Better communication and cultural diversity training for staff would help. The awful cramped B787 and shockingly bad food on 2 sectors (lukewarm and mass packaged and prepared). Avoid any sectors that use the B787 Dreamliner it's a nightmare.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-18;"Flew LHR to BKK and back a few weeks ago final destination Siem Reap in Cambodia. Picked my flights based on trying out the A380 for one leg and then other three sectors on the 777-300ER which I'd read reviews were the most comfortable. Funnily enough found the A380 segment the most enjoyable and comfortable - both hard and soft product just seemed a little bit more ""all there"" and I could swear there was more legroom in the A380 than on the 777 despite the official figures saying otherwise - Maybe seat thickness and how it's sculptured? Food is average but edible - Oh and there's no timing advantage to pre-ordering a special meal it gets loaded in the trolley and served alongside everybody else's. On the way back journey originated in Siem Reap in Cambodia on Bangkok Airways - Because they code share w QR I managed to get my luggage checked through to LHR even got boarding passes issued all the way too!";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-16;MAN to BKK economy via Doha. Both legs delayed by at least an hour though boarding on-time. Was worried about connection at Doha but assured nothing to worry about as we had made up the lost hour. At Doha circled for over 30 mins before landing. Airport (state of the art new Hamad hub airport) in chaos due to smog. Face masks required all though airport! I have never experienced this in my life time. In-flight entertainment system excellent as are food and drinks services. This is an airline where staff appear happy in their jobs. On both legs one cooked meal (delicious) then one snack ( a wrap or a pasty) handed out. During flight soft drinks and snacks available. Good choice of free alcoholic drinks too including champagne by request. I don't usually travel economy class for long haul flights but it is well worth it with Qatar.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-16;NRT-WAW end of March and WAW-NRT week later. Family with small (5 and 7) children. 1 hour late departure to Warsaw rest on time. Very good seat on NRT-DOH (and DOH-NRT) flight (772) really no problem with space for big person (185cm/110kg). On DOH-WAW much smaller (320)  but still OK for 6 hours. From Warsaw IFE wasn't working at all for one seat (have to reseat) and also was very difficult to use it on another. Overhead lights wasn't working at all for 3 seats. Small amenity kit even in economy! Food good and plenty children food in really nice box. Cabin crew not attentive but also not bad. Very recommended (especially for the price that I've paid).;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-12;LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit. Two meals were absolutely inedible which was really surprising.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-11;DOH-DFW business class on QR733 using 777-300 (changed equipment from 777-200). According to Wikipedia the 19th longest scheduled flight in the world (16h5m). Had seat 1A with no one beside me. Usual obliging service on board from a very courteous and professional crew. Have just got onto an American Airlines flight in first where I basically had my dinner tossed at me - what a difference from QR! Flight left DOH about an hour late due to an equipment change. Nice seat good food. I have no complaints about QR. For this trip I joined their mileage program. Before I was collecting miles on QR flights using my BA account but not getting much in terms of bonus miles or progress toward higher tier status. Decided to switch over to QR's program as I have a lot of travel with QR coming up.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-11;A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access. configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets. My verdict is that Qatar Business is good but definitely not well above that of Cathay or BA as people claim.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-11;Recently flew LHR-AUH-LHR with a stopover in Doha. It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay. It was a miracle that I've managed to catch a LHR flight which also arrived in London with a 20-minute delay. Despite their cheap fares I'm not going to fly with Qatar Airways anymore. I'll better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-05-05;April 15: Cape Town - Doha- return Brisbane - Cape Town May 2 2015. Cannot fault this airline standards are kept high on all sectors. Bought ticket online when Qatar had a special 40% discount!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-30;Recently flew from LHR to AUH via DOH. First leg was supposed to be an A380 which I specifically booked changed to a 777 which was annoying but nonetheless very comfortable. A comfortable 3-3-3 configuration on 777 unlike other Gulf carriers which opt for a cramped 3-4-3. Transit at Hamad international was very simple a very clean and not too large airport. Lots of food given and even champagne served in economy! A320 DOH-AUH and back decent snack provided good for a short-haul. Again easy transit and onto a very new A330 back to LHR service fantastic but seats were noticeably smaller in width compared to 777 but a very new IFE. On departing LHR I arrived late at the airport but the Qatar ground staff were very reassuring and helpful making sure I caught the flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-28;At the end of March and again the beginning of April we travelled from TXL to DOH in an A330-200 business class. The total impression of the interior was not positive but rather rundown. The cabin staff on the other hand â€“ were very polite and helpful making the flight really agreeable. The electronic seat adjustment device of a great number of seats did not really work so you had to put up with some awkward seating positions. The most unusual sight was a passenger nearly lying flat on the seat during landing after several staff tried in vain to put the seat in an upright position. Another highlight were the attempts of several cabin staff members to unlock dining tables with spoons. In the end they succeeded. The meals did not really offer inflight dining experience it was more business as usual - nothing worth mentioning. On the whole we had the impression that for this unimportant route written off aircraft's are used whose cabin maintenance leaves a lot to be desired. On our return flight there were no technical problems worth mentioning except that now the cabin crew members were more interested in chatting with each other than serving meals and drinks.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-27;LHR-DXB via DOH. Both legs of the flights were operated by an aged A340-600. I think Qatar should start thinking of not sending these aircraft's to such long haul routes. Aircraft was very tired from inside and the leg room was awful - so tight. Your flight would be ruined if the person in front reclines their seat as there will no room for you to move or watch. Food was of a very low standard. Coming back again aircraft was an A330-200/300 leg. Frankly speaking the leg room was much better on this aircraft however again old and tired from inside with cabin crew not being attentive to passengers.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-27;LHR-DOH-BKK in economy all the way on their brand new A380. Two great trips. Only problem is that the food is terrible and portions extremely small. Why do they bother? Best take your own. I had a rubbery chicken which tasted like something else. Space in economy seats on the A380 is extremely generous equivalent to BA WT+. Very impressive. Connection at Doha was very easy: off the plane and straight into departure area for connecting passengers no security check there. I am a BA Gold card EC so am allowed to use First check in First lounges and priority boarding. However Qatar is so fussy about its premium passengers I was not allowed to board via priority First class boarding even though I was in small economy cabin at the back of the upper deck where First and Business are located. I had to board and disembark via usual channels via lower cabin which means if you are in economy in the upper deck you will be last to disembark. Cosy small cabin though. Is this in breach of Oneworld rules regarding perks of being Emerald? The word that first came to my mind is segregation. They take incredible measures to protect their premium passengers from any contact with the rest of us ordinary mortals. I have never seen anything like this in my many years of continuos travelling in First Business and economy. Staff are professional. I had access to First class lounge at Doha which is gigantic nice but mayhem at peak hours. Amazing service though. The good thing about it is that there are several areas one could choose from. I went for the one adjacent to the business centre which was very quiet indeed. Both flight were not full. LHR to DOH was almost empty. A good experience I am happy to repeat especially when the price for tickets was one of the best I have seen in years to get from LHR to BKK.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-22;MAD-DEL via Doha return on 777-300 and 787 both ways. An excellent trip overall. Check in friendly quick and efficient for all flown sectors. Seats comfortable and converted to fully flat beds. Staff courteous friendly and efficient. They make you feel at home with an almost personalized service. Food and beverage of high quality. Entertainment endless. Lounge at Doha new airport one of the best I believe. A wonderful experience.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-22;ZRH-DOH first time travelled on this Dreamliner. Pretty excited about that. Nice ambience and facilities though it is already started showing its age. Toilets were not clean enough. I think QR has a good investment in hardware but its software - i.e. the crew are not as attentive as other airlines that I've travelled on before. eCheck in at ZRH was a breeze attentive ground staff by SWISSPORT. Service started from pre-meal drinks meal snack another round of pre-landing pre-pour drink which was good enough for a 5-hour flight the IFE was good but not user-friendly as you need to key in the movie number for the specific movie.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-16;SHJ-DOH-NBO March 9-14th. What was supposed to be a pleasant and enjoyable flight actually has been a nightmare from the beginning to the end. Check-in at Sharjah was chaotic  a ground staff member belonging to Air Arabia opened the counter 30 minutes late and were needing 15 to 20 minutes to treat every passenger even in the priority lane. My request for an emergency exit for a wider pitch was ignored. Had to ask 3 times for the Business Class lounge invitation card and the female agent even forgot to give my passport to me after (finally) printing my tickets. Police controls were crowded the time spent at the VIP lounge was the only enjoyable moment. QR Chef d'Escale was very friendly and helpful. No special welcome for Privilege club old A320 aircraft snack served was awful and nothing other than water available. Transit time at Doha was the worst: despite QR sales office promise of hotel accommodation being provided for more than an 8 hour transit I discovered that passengers coming from/going to Sharjah were excluded of this courtesy. I had to stay overnight in the Oryx Lounge which was crowded. No earplugs nor eye mask available. At least showers were very clean and comfortable. Food offer was ridiculous coffee machine was not working. DOH-NBO morning flight was miserable: old tired A320 no IFE for a 5 hours flight seats cramped no special welcome for Privilege Club and no geovision. The same can be said about the return flight with the same issue at Doha regarding transit. My last time with Qatar Airways.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-16;Our route was on March 3 2015 London - Doha - Johannesburg - Port Elizabeth and was quite OK. Everything up to expectations. Our flight back on April 9th was also OK until the flight on April 10th from Doha to London flight no. QR011 Airbus A340-600 that flight was awful the seating was so tight you could hardly move the service was not up to Qatar Airways standards and worst of all before the flight was over most of the toilets were out of water.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-14;QR845 12 March KUL-DOHA. QR237 DOH-IST. Return flight 23 March QR240. IST-DOH. QR844 DOH-KUL. Was given different seats from Doha to Istanbul although I have booked the seats and got a confirmation email from Qatar Airways resulting us being separated from each other. Tea and coffee were not offered and took quite a long time to get a cup of coffee after requested for one. On the flight back from Istanbul to Doha lunch took ages to be served. The air hostesses don't seem to move and was at the first 3 rows for almost 1 hour while those serving on the other side has already distributed to all passengers. Please improve.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-14;Manchester to Melbourne return - flight very good as always I had 2 seats to myself on the Doha to Melbourne which enabled me to have about 6/7 hrs sleep. The only criticism is that the films/music etc is a little outdated and the films are quite old. The new airport is very big and bright but I found my way around quite easily and there are plenty of Qatar air staff just walking about ready to help if needed I've already booked again for next year.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-12;Flew CDG-DOH-SGN-HAN-DOH-CDG: flights CDG-DOH and returns on A380 very good flights service and entertainment with enough size leg space (I am 6.20). Flight DOH-SGN on A330 old plane lucky plane half empty. Very good service. Return HAN-DOH a nightmare. Was a B777 with technical stop in BKK total 11 hours on a seat with broken seat cushion. Perception on being seated on a wooden bar. Luckily could move to another seat after some time (two weeks after return still hurts when seating). In general very good service friendly staff and transit in DOH without any problem. I would recommend QR except for this seat problem on the B777.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-10;LHR-DOH-HKT 19/3/2015. First leg was the ageing A340 which I must add was a superb aircraft very comfortable. Second leg was a A330-300 not so great seats felt worn out. Service wise I have found having travelled with Qatar that it would appear they put their 'best' staff on the Heathrow route and other routes such as Phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. Overall having been a loyal customer of Qatar over the years I am not sure I will be in the future. I agree with other comments that Qatar are riding on past reputations. Food is average at best. Inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. And entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. They did however provide bassinets for my kids (although on the Phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly). Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport is a joke lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-10;BKK-DOH-LHR 1/4/2015. First leg was the new A380 which I personally feel is average at best. Certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as Emirates A380. Second leg was an A340 which was fine. Service really wasn't great. Whilst staff are smiley it does feel very forced now and I can see the change over the last few years. Food again was average. Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport. On the way back Qatar had a sand storm the terminal building was filled with sand and people were really suffering. Whilst I understand this is an act of nature I would like to think if you operate in a region that has extreme weather conditions then you accommodate accordingly.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-06;FRA-DOH on the new Airbus A350. What a nice experience-even quieter than the giant A380 this is a lovely plane and very nice interior that whilst is very similar to the 787 is another level up in terms of classiness-next flight was on a 787 from Doha-Singapore. Looking forward to our return journey on the A350. Also worth noting that routing FRA-SIN was so much cheaper than LHR-SIN - but more hassle to get a connecting BA flight from LhR to FRA but for the 3 of us it saved several thousand pounds!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-06;I will never fly Qatar Airways again flying Manchester-Doha-Johannesburg and return. Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew. Also found the seats very uncomfortable and had a sore back for days after returning home. Never again!;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-04-01;14/3/15 on QR26. QR840 on 15/3/15. QR841 on 28/3/15. QR21 on 29/3/15. Just had four flights using Qatar 1st Manchester to Doha new Airbus 330 good comfortable seats IFE system good USB port on all seat backs. Food and drinks service good lots of soft drinks and water throughout the flight. 2nd Doha to Phuket old airbus 330 seats ok but old and starting to wear thin. IFE again ok but using old system food and drink service good. 3rd Phuket to Doha old 330 seats poor legs and bum numb after 2 hours no support or comfort IFE old system food very poor drinks ok when requested. 4th Doha to Manchester Very old 330 seat comfort very poor food poor water and soft drinks only on request IFE old system and kept failing (freezing) also very difficult to hear as there was so much background noise from the aircraft engines. Overall not very good experience standards have dropped so much since the last time we used Qatar (2013) think they are living on past reputations.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-30;"There are two reasons why I would never fly with Qatar airways again: 1) Their apparent policy regarding delayed flights. I spent 13 hours at Kathmandu airport this weekend waiting for a flight back to London via Doha. Weather may be beyond their control but how they respond to it is not. They were the last of the airlines to be able to land and filled the first flights in with passengers on later scheduled flights in priority to ourselves who had waited the longest. Consequently our 12.30pm flight finally got away at 9.30pm when they appeared to find an extra plane under the sofa . Not a great disaster in the scheme of things but if I have a choice of an airline that makes an attempt to get those who have waited the longest away first then I will take it. 2) Comfort: The seats appear to be ergonomically designed for maximum discomfort. I am a 5ft 5"" guy who weights 8 stone and I had problems I can't imagine what it must be like if you are taller and wider. After about 2 hours in to a 7 hours flight I was really struggling. That said I can't fault the service-the cabin crew were efficient friendly and attentive. Shame then about 1 and 2.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-30;I rode in economy class from YUL to DOH and then back again on the Qatar Airways Boeing 777-300er. Having also tried Saudi Arabian Airlines and Emirates I would have to say that overall (especially in seat comfort) Emirates is the better choice. I would also recommend choosing Emirates for longer flights like YUL to DOH.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-30;Singapore-Doha-Edinburgh on the 787. Lounge in Singapore was better than I expected after reading reviews small selection of hot and cold food and small drinks selection but it was cool and fairly quiet. Good priority boarding at Singapore and bus transfer at Doha - separate bus exclusively for business class. On both legs we were welcomed on board by name and shown to our seats and given pre takeoff drink and the offer of a newspaper and amenity bag provided. Pyjamas were only provided on the Singapore-Doha leg. At all times we were referred to by name and after takeoff CSD introduced themselves staff checked that we knew how all the controls worked on the seat and IFE I witnessed them showing great patience helping an elderly gentleman get to grips with the IFE. We were provided with a wine and food menu and it was explained that we could dine as and when we wanted. The food and wine selection was very good and the food was presented very well. The cabin crew were continuously walking the cabin quietly offering service when it was required. Found the seat very comfortable in all positions and managed to sleep for around 4-5 hours on each leg. The toilets were spacious and were kept in a spotless condition Our first experience of Qatar and I can guarantee that it won't be our last. A world apart from our outward trip on BA. Totally recommend Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-30;Flew HAN-BKK-DOH-DWC (Dubai “World) and return to Hanoi in March 2015 in economy (HAN-BKK-HAN on B777-3) business (BKK-DOH on A380 and DOH-BKK on B777) and first (DOH-DWC-DOH on A320) respectively. Fantastic airline in all classes. Except for “First” within middle East which is not “real” First on a A320 as the seats are only typical old style bz/class seats. But as for the A380 the bz class gives a sublime experience almost to perfection. The bar onboard offers intelligently other brands of drinks as those on the menu card served while seated. I like the herring bone seat layout and found the trip cozy and staff caring. Ate at demand. Sophisticated drink lists with many expensive items offered like several wines one normally does not access easily. As usual poor on beer options. Only small portions of food offered as compared to earlier business class experiences with QR. Staff alert and professional and truly caring. A great experience. All flights on time except one which caused a missing connection however QR instantly rebooked to my satisfaction and eventually I arrived on time to final destinations. They have a tendency to close servicing passengers on board far too early before landing (approx. 40 minutes) which is disappointing and unnecessary annoying.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-28;Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was great - really personalised service. Felt like being in a swanky hotel rather than a lounge. On-board the seats were fine not as nice as Emirates but for sure a comfy space. Great food and beverage service little tip they leave the Krug at the bar worth the walk over! IFE was a bit skippy. DOH-RHY on 787 they used Business but rebrand it as first Short trip so fine - not a major fan of the 787. The lounge in Riyadh is abysmal but it's shared. Spent time in duty free to avoid this lounge. Doha terminal nice easy to have a long layover especially here with the family rooms available for a sleep and Krug on Tap. Don't recommend the 45 min transfer the terminal is big and there is no help on connections to get you there on time - at least they let business out as priority so I had a chance and the run woke me up a little bit. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping again but more frequently) but as they handed out PJ's it encouraged everyone to go to sleep. Service on both legs excellent.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-28;Qatar Airways has been a long time favourite as the service is extremely good. On the flight QR564 from Doha to Delhi on 19 March I had very severe earache and I must say that the chief steward really went the extra mile providing me with a hot honey and lemon drink - mush appreciated and really unexpected for an economy class passenger! However the boarding at Delhi on 8th March was a terrible experience - standing in 5 queues for an hour and a half at dawn is not funny especially for a senior citizen. Also there was no in-flight entertainment on the flight from Doha to Nairobi nor on the one from Dar es Salaam to Doha. Plus the meal served on the Doha Delhi flight was really substandard - some kind of chicken korma!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-28;Nice cabin on newish 777 Dreamliners PHL-Doha-Colombo. Improved legroom in coach good entertainment and food. Cabin crew well above par. One small complaint: The free Doha city tour (layover of five hrs) a great idea and heavily hyped on their site and inflight magazine can only accommodate twenty people at a time and I believe only goes out every two hours. It's a joke as thousands are connecting through at any given time. (if you haven't guessed we were bumped and somewhat casually by the ground staff in Doha who were more interested in returning to their chat than apologizing or explaining the situation).;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-25;CDG-DOH-CPT on board A380 and 787 Nice flight Good food and drinks. The night flight was very quiet! Will fly again on Qatar!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-23;Travelled over the Christmas period 24/12/14 to 12/1/15 to Singapore Changi. Was hesitant after having read some of the reviews. It had been a couple of years since I had travelled with them last. Was traveling with family so 3 adults and 3 children aged 6 2 and 1. Overall experience was excellent and would travel with them again. The planes were fairly new. Plus points-Qatar staff at all airports from Manchester to return from Changi were great with children which was our biggest worry. Also were very helpful during all flights. Food and drink were served frequently through all flights. Only some minor negatives the entertainment for children was very basic - checked prior to flight and a lot of the programmes that had been mentioned were not available on flight which was disappointing. Also pre-ordered my mothers food who eats Asian non veg food but not beef. Requested the Hindu non- veg meal thinking they will most likely serve Chicken or Lamb for this request but to my mothers disappointment they served prawns (very lovely indeed from my point of view) so if anyone like my mother you may have to request specifically what you want prior as a special request. Would travel with them again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-20;Trip was Stockholm to Dubai via Doha (Economy class). Flow with the new 787 Dreamliner and as many have written here the seats are quite bad. Really disappointing since I had higher expectations on Qatar Airways. The seats are small legroom is tight and the IFE-box takes up to much space. The entertainment-system is good food and service is also good. Also flew with their A330 which is more comfortable but the entertainment system is really old now. Their best airplanes are without doubt the Boeing 777 which is both comfortable and modern. That's the plane I recommend if you travel with Qatar Airways. But for me I will choose another carrier next time.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-20;Flew LHR-Doha-Cape Town out Jo'burg-Doha-LHR back. Much cheaper than BA direct flight which we have used before. Service comfort and food all several grades better than BA as well. Well worth the extra 6 hours journey time and change in Doha for the better comfort and service alone. Change at Doha with 2 hour window was easy and actually broke the journey nicely. Will do again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-20;AMD-DOH-LHR. The lounge in Ahmedabad is very funny. All the airlines use it but it is more of a cupboard behind a restaurant. The flight to Doha is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight. On the return leg we flew on the new A380 from Doha to London. That was a horrible experience and I will avoid this aircraft like the plague. The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail. I gave up after the 3rd attempt and went and sat in the bar with my wife which is quite pleasant.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-20;LHR-DOH-AMD and back again. The lounge in London is really nice. We flew on the A340-600 which is quite old and is not lie flat but its decent enough. The lounge in Doha is horrible especially compared to the old one. Its huge impersonal and it feels like most of the airport is in there with you rather than being a quiet sanctuary. More like a school canteen than a business lounge. The flight to Ahmedabad is on an A321 and is fine. Its not lie flat or anything but its a very short flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;"I flew BRU-DOH-DXB and back. Even though the leg DOH-DXB is rated as first class I sub-summarize it as a business class trip because the cabin product is the same. The cabin and the seat are very comfortable nothing to complain. But the service level in general is very low. Starting by the performance of the cabin crew in business class: very hectic not really attentive. They don't use trolleys in business class they serve every guest individually from the galley. This leads to a very hectic atmosphere in the cabin because the crew has to walk a lot. They miss having any grace whilst serving it seems the invention of a service tray has been totally ignored. They bring your plate with bare hands from the galley when they realised that they forgot a spoon and knife they came back holding the spoon in one hand and the knife in the other instead of putting in on a tray and serving it nicely. On the short trip from Doha to Dubai this one-after-another type of service lead to the fact that the last business class row was served only 5 minutes prior to the start of the descent so the poor people could not even finish their meal. But the worst I had to experience was the check-in in Dubai: there was one counter for first and business class passengers and one counter for status members. Both lines totally overcrowded and the check-in procedure went on really slow. After waiting for more than 30 min. some of the first class passengers tried to move to the so called ""help desk"" to ask for check-in there. Suddenly a Qatar airways representative appeared and yelled at them they should go back to their line. I waited more than 50 minutes until I could check- in. The ""first-class"" lounge of Qatar airways is very small and old and was totally overcrowded. Not the way I want to be treated as a first or business class passenger. I think they have to do first a lot of improvement in their service level until they can compete with airlines such as Singapore Airlines.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;I had never flown with Qatar before but what a wonderful surprise. Early check in at Heathrow and returning at Kathmandu meant we had extra leg room seats on all sectors there and back. Drinks service was wonderful and you can have what you want I was allowed to have champagne with my dinner. The food choice was lovely and tasty. The staff could not do enough for the passengers I have to say I would recommend and definitely fly with Qatar again. If I had any advice I would say they needed another set of toilets on the planes and I found the seats a little tight although I am a large man and I had extra legroom so it did not matter.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;Went with Qatar Airways from Stockholm to Dubai through Doha. First flight was with their new Boeing 787 - Dreamliner. Good entertainment system high resolution screen but slow response in the touch and a lack of music and TV-series. The seat config is not good however the leg-room is a bit disappointing. Otherwise the Dreamliner is a nice airplane. On the way back it was with the A330 which is getting old and they should really change the entertainment system onboard. It didn't even work so the flight back was quite boring. Had a short flight with their B777 also from Doha to Dubai which is probably the best airplane Qatar has got right now. More legroom good entertainment system and so on.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;BCN to KUL via DOH. All flights on A-330 200 . The seatmaps for this type of plane are a little misleading. They all show the 4 rows of Biz Class in one large block but the reality is rows 1-3 are in the forward cabin and strangely row 4 only is on its own in a very small section between the Galley and Econ section. My wife and I were seated in seats 4 J+K. It does feel pretty private but of course you are more prone to any noise from kids etc behind in Econ. I guess you pays your money and takes your choice! Food copious and excellent quality on all flights but they can be a bit slow in refilling wine glasses. Even these refurbished A330's are beginning to show their age and frankly the seats are rather lumpy and not all that comfortable even when fully flat. Whilst the boarding at both KL and Barcelona was fine I have to say I was disappointed with that at Doha. 3 out of the 4 flights to or from there were from outlying stands  not jetways. I really find it hard to see how with a brand new airport that trumpets itself as one of the world's best that so many flights involve a long trek followed by being herded onto a bus and having to climb steep steps to board . That sort of thing may have been OK on a charter flight to Majorca from Luton in the '80s but really does not cut the mustard in 2015 on a Business class ticket on a supposedly 5* airline! But overall for the price it is a good product.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;Travelled Business Class DOH-FRA. Was booked on the new A350 with flat beds. Two days before the flight plane was swapped to an A330 with ski slope beds. This is the third time I have had an aircraft substitution to an inferior product with Qatar. Until they can standardise their Business Class product to that of their 787's/A380's I would not recommend them as what product you receive on the day you fly seems a total lottery. If a flat bed and sleep is a priority for you avoid.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-17;BCN-DOH-DXB inbound flight made on January 5th after an outbound on December 18th with Royal Jordanian. BCN-DOH first leg was neither a good nor bad surprise: quite smooth check-in thanks to my Sapphire OneWorld status enjoyable VIP Lounge at BCN airport (although not well-provided at all about food) respected Priority Boarding no delays. Equipment was a newly-configured Airbus A330-200 I was seated in an emergency exit so I had extra legroom. Food average nice selection of beverages. Things became complicated when I collapsed on the 5th hour of the flight (hyper arterial pressure) and was put within hands of cabin crew. QR does not know how to manage a simple issue whatsoever: disembarked at DOH all the way to airport clinic then sent to Hamad hospital for further examinations. The nightmare took 19 hours. Had to fly back to DXB on the following day. Had to spend overnight at Oryx Lounge.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-09;LHR-DOH-DXB and back. On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA Virgin et al. Service was good though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-09;Like Alison Swain who wrote on 24 February of her surprise at the window blinds being put down and the cabin lights dimmed during a daytime flight I likewise was dismayed by the same thing on a Doha to Paris flight in November 2014. The flight was virtually empty so I just got up and opened up all the blinds that the cabin crew had shut so that I could see out and enjoy the spectacular views of Mt Ararat amongst other things. I too wondered why on earth the cabin staff were making us think we were flying at night and I found it very irritating sufficiently so that I would hesitate to fly this airline again notably as neither the seat comfort not the staff service nor the food nor the inflight entertainment were particularly noteworthy.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-09;"CPH-DOH-DXB round-trip. CPH-DOH with Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Nice plane tasty food but very cramped seating on this 6-7 hours flight. Doha-Dubai shorthaul on an airbus 321 with great legroom under one hour flight but they serve a small meal and beverages. Dubai-Doha airbus 330 once again great legroom and service. After the ""spacious"" seating on the short flights the seating felt even more cramped on the longer flight between Doha and Copenhagen. But new clean planes and very friendly helpful staff on all legs still made the trip a pleasure. All flights departed on time and arrived ahead schedule. Smooth boarding.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-09;QR 957 on Jan 9th and QR 956 on Feb 1st. CGK-DOH-CGK Business A330. First and last time. These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space and the midsection goes up. This gets you in a totally unnatural position. Their product on 380 and 777 is better but avoid the 330 at any cost. Just buy and economy seat or fly another airline who better understood the needs of BC travellers.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;QR1360 JNB-DOH. Seat 4A. After an on-time departure from JNB the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory so the woman in front of me said “why don't you tell him”. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later the woman in front of me while going to the lavatory stopped at my seat and said “do I have your permission to go to the washroom?” Honestly the crew should be paying more attention not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin. A tense atmosphere on board could and should have been avoided by the crew doing their job which lets not forget is first and foremost about safety not service.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;DFW-Doha-Cochin Prompt boarding both ways. Delightful crew and great food. No complaints. However transfer at Doha could be a nightmare due to having to go security again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;Flew from LHR to DOH 23rd February for an onward connection to Phuket. The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;Manchester-Doha-Melbourne 20th Feb 2015. First leg to Doha on A330-200 not fully booked I had aisle seat plenty of room for my legs (I'm six foot). My entertainment system froze halfway through the film I was watching so I ended up watching the screen on the next (empty) seat. Shiny screens so your reflection dominates a lot of what you watch. Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems. Food probably slightly better but again seems to be a slow process. Overall however I arrived in Melbourne feeling fit and refreshed and would definitely take the same route again. Here's hoping for Airbus on the return journey.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;LHR-DOH return QR016/015 on the all Business class A319 paid for with QMiles. Excellent food and drink provided by good crews. Seats comfortable but a bit tight for anyone in the window seats due to the 2-2 configuration. IFE extensive but control via the i-phone style handset a bit temperamental. As a flight that was basically a 'freebie' helped by passenger loads under 50% this was very enjoyable. However if the flights had been full I suspect I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-03-04;Flew QR on 3 Feb to Cape Town. The Dreamliner was most disappointing. Noisy Cabin. Narrow seats no leg room. And if you are above 5'10 you will struggle to squeeze in. Food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. Nuts would have been a 100 times better. Old hindi movies and very limited choice on TV channels. Never again on QR.;NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2015-02-24;I flew London-Doha-Kathmandu on 3rd February also in Economy class. The first flight was a Boeing 777 and the second an Airbus A-320. The first flight was one of the best I have had after a bad start. An angry inconsiderate passenger in front of me refused to put up his seat while lunch was served and was incredibly rude to me and the cabin attendant. The cabin attendant suggested I move to an empty emergency door seat which I did and had lots of legroom. The plane was immaculate as was the service. The second flight to Kathmandu was also excellent in every way. Both flights were on time and all flight attendants that I could see were extremely professional helpful and friendly. I highly recommend this airline to all. I am now looking forward to flying on the Airbus A-350.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-24;CBR (QF to PER) to MAD Via PER and DOH. This is the second time I have flown Qatar and again was very pleased with the result. All check in staff courteous and helpful. Cabin staff very helpful. Food was simple but very good. Seat was particularly wide for Economy 18.9 inches I think and legroom and recline good. I never sleep well but the cabin and seating gave me the best chance it could in a fairly crowded economy class. Excellent value for money if you can get one of their promotional fares but good anyway.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-24;EDI-DOH (13/2/15) DOH-EDI (18/2/15) on B787 Dreamliner - 7 hour sector. Great to have this direct route and seems very popular especially for connections. Second time I have used this service third trip with Qatar. 787 economy seats uncomfortable the 3-3-3 configuration a strange choice. A330 service I flew on in June 2014 DOH-HKG seats were much more comfortable and 2-4-2 better. Metal box on floor on 787 restricts leg room. Leg room tight and unbearable when passenger in front reclines their seat (better leg room on Easyjet a low frills airline). Emirates 777 seats better from GLA-DXB. Cabin service and crew were good on this trip.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-24;Flew LHR-DOH-DAC. The trip started at the Qatar Business lounge at T4. I thought the lounge was excellent. Food service comfort all first rate. The first flight was on an A319 all business class. The plane feels very exclusive and the level of service and attention was superb. However as a solo traveller I would opt for a different aircraft if possible which allows every passenger direct aisle access. Saying that I sat on the aisle and my neighbour sitting at the window never woke me up getting to the loo. The food was the best I have experienced on a flight. The food I had particularly the main course - lamb with couscous were superb. The flight departed and arrived an hour late but on this occasion this was no problem as I had quite a long layover at Doha. The plane parked on a remote stand and we were bussed on a limo-coach type of coach. It was equipped with 12 spacious sofas. There was no queue at the transit security they x-rayed our bags and I was through to the Al Mourjan lounge within minutes. The lounge is huge with plenty of space to sit I found a sofa to lie down for a few hours before taking a shower and having lunch at the upstairs restaurant. This was a buffet affair rather than cook to order at LHR. Overall I cant knock the lounge it was lovely but I much preferred the LHR lounge it felt more exclusive and the food offering was much better. Unfortunately my flight was delayed by +2 hours and ended up eating again at the lounge. I tried the downstairs restaurant but it only served cold food so returned to the upstairs restaurant. I departed from gate A8 which took about 10 minutes to get to. Amazingly I was the only passenger in Business Class there are 30 seats in the Business cabin of the A330-300 and it was weird having 29 empty seats and 5 FAs to look after me. I had a glass of excellent Billicart Salmon Brut champagne as a pre-flight drink then a fabulous St Clair Sav Blanc with my meal. I chose the mushroom and basil oil soup followed by a rump of lamb. I was too full for a any dessert The food was not as good as the first flight and as expected for a 4 hour flight it was a three course meal rather than a seven course banquet. We arrived just after 2am and I was through immigration in no time. Mainly as there were so few passengers requiring to complete visa on arrival. The hotel had arranged for a fixer to collect me and deliver me to the car pick up point where the hotel mini-van was there to collect me.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-24;Flew LHR-DOH on the A380 Lounge access at LHR was good but cheap Champagne. On-board the seat was great. Great food and beverage service. IFE was spot on too. DOH-DAC on A330 They used First Class seating as J seating so I managed to get a flat-bed. Food and beverage on that leg was not great dry possibly due to a delay out of DOH also the IFE has to be reset several times. Return sectors RGN-DOH was on the A330 comfortable seat once again the food from RGN wasn't great but I was hungry so ate it. DOH-LHR was on the Business One A319 aircraft. Comfortable Seats IFE didn't work properly (kept skipping) but I needed to sleep and I think I got about five hours.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-24;Just returned to Edinburgh today on QR027 from Doha on Dreamliner. As this is a day flight leaving at 7.30am which is why we booked it does anyone know why every single window blind was put in to blackout mode after breakfast was served (not done by the passengers) and the cabin lights dimmed? Stayed this way throughout flight couldn't even see what the FA was serving us unless you put reading light on. If I wanted the ambience of a night flight I would have booked one! Just wondered if it is Qatar Airways policy to do this even on daytime flights. We were in economy 12 E & F. More legroom on short haul 737s very cramped very disappointed passenger!;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-18;WAW-DOH-BKK and return. Check-in and boarding quick. Aircraft on all flights equipped with PTVs and a great variety of entertainment features good food unlimited drinks including champagne whisky and cognac. Staff very nice and helpful composed of staff from around the globe speaking very good English. DOH-BKK-DOH onboard brand new A380 - the most comfortable flight I've flown. Plenty of legroom very wide PTVs and comfy seats. Now it's hard to change QR for anything else.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-18;QR008 Heathrow to Qatar. Seat 14c Economy. No issues at check in or gate Nice comfortable flight about as good as it gets in Economy. Friendly and helpful crew and probably the reason Qatar gets is 5 star award.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-18;Flew from DOH-LHR on the 12.50pm flight and it was my poorest experience on QA to date. Started off well in the lounge with good service but as soon as I stepped onto the plane the AC was not working. The plane set off with a known fault. During the flight my in-flight system was not working and eventually I gave up. Furthermore on landing we were held on the tarmac without any update from the pilot and to compound a totally miserable flight the walkway was unable to be used due to power loss (not the fault of QA but added to the misery with pilots going into radio silence). What saved me from scoring the trip satisfaction as 1/10 was the usual impeccable flight crew service - top class. QA can do much better and on this flight the experience was anything but a 5* standard.;NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2015-02-12;I had the pleasure of flying with Qatar from NZ to Brazil return and I found there level of service and food superb the only thing they need to look at is their entertainment system it is not reliable at all I spent 28 hours over two flights going there and 23 hours coming back and over the 4 flights in each case I found when you plug your head phones into the socket it was loose and gave a distorted sound. Really annoying when your in a airplane for 14 hours straight. I encourage them to check their systems.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-12;I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-12;4 flights 3 of them were a very nice experience. New planes on time and very fast good service. Flight nr. 4 (7h) was with a older A330 and the crew was not so motivated or a bit disorganised. Very slow service. They skipped the first run with drinks and snack and start to serve with the dinner after a while. It took more than 90 minutes to get the first drinks and some food. That flight was a very different experience and not what you expect from a 5 star airline. The new economy seats at the 787 are not very comfortable. hard narrow and a metal box under the seat.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-12;"Flew on 787 Dreamliner from Doha to Singapore. Must say I was so close to my neighbor that I was afraid we would amalgamate into one! All the other amenities and food experience went right out of the window. Anyway all the other things like food entertainment crew were good. But none of it matters when a 6"" slightly heavy guy sits in the plane. Qatar Airways might be doing a great job in the Premium Class but since majority of the people travel by economy it should rethink its strategy. Chances of me travelling on Qatar are very small.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-06;I flew LHR-DOH-PER in business class in December 2014. Seats / staff / service excellent. Catering however for special diet (gluten free) was awful. Nicely presented but just dry chicken FOUR times over the 2 legs! GF is very easy diet to produce tasty meal. Just had a far better one on Qantas domestic flight in economy! Have flown all major airlines to Oz and this was the worst for me for food.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-06;JNB-DOH-KWI business class. Seat 4K on JNB-DOH on Dreamliner. On boarding went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights. I like the 1-2-1 seating in biz class on the 787.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-02-06;Milan to Nairobi via Doha. Both legs on A320 aircraft. The newer aircraft on the first leg provided softer seating and entertainment on demand while the older A320 on the second leg had harder seating and no entertainment. Legroom is an issue because of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you (F seats) but otherwise okay. Recline is generous even though people behind you complain that it invades their space.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-28;CMB-FRA business class. I took the night flight and I arrived rested in Germany 30 minutes earlier than expected so I was able to change my connecting flight within Germany and arrived earlier at my final destination in Germany. On my return to CMB in Frankfurt the ground handling staff were very impolite firstly when they didn't know which class I was in suddenly when they saw my ticket a smile appeared this shouldn't be every customer should be treated the same way. The flight from FRA to DOH had a delay therefore the connecting time to DOH to CMB was only 30 minutes. As earlier stated in some of the reviews from others some of the planes business class is just a better economic class as you are unable to rest. However I wouldn't mind recommending the airline.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-28;Flew economy on Boeing 787 Dreamliner from Edinburgh to Bali via Doha. Worst seating I have encountered in economy. Not only are the seats very narrow but some design genius who has never flown economy thought it would be a good feature to locate a large IFE box under the seat so one leg will always be constantly rubbing against it. When the seat in front is reclined there is no room to move so the people in the window or middle seat are trapped. Service was ok but choice of movies not as extensive as Emirates.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-28;Flew QR 651 Kathmandu-Doha on 20th Jan and QR 11 Doha-LHR on 21st Jan. Both flights in economy class and were excellent. The first flight was on an Airbus 330 and the second on an Airbus 340. The cabin attendants were friendly and helpful. A small wet towel to freshen up after wake up would have been nice before we ate breakfast. Both flights were punctual. Food was as good as can be expected on a flight. The new Hamad Airport in Doha can only be described as superb in every way. My next journey will be on 3rd February LHR-DOH-KTM and two further round trips expected this year. I will continue to use Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-28;KUW-DOH-TEH. All flights on time. Flying Qatar is always great. Fast and easy check in ground staff very attentive. Boarding on time and FA the best service of any airline I have flown so far. Comfortable A320 both sectors good legroom. Full meal on every flight. IFE also available. Doha new airport amazing. Perfect organization no lines for security on connection. Business lounge the best I've seen so far. Arrival on time bags on belt short after arrival.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-28;Edinburgh to Doha flight QR 28 on 24th January 2015. First time I've flown with Qatar Airways. I would not hesitate in recommending them. I believe this is the best economy class flight I have been on. Spacious seating tasty food and friendly attentive staff. I have experience of long haul flights where the cabin crew get the service out of the way as quickly as possible and then disappear behind a curtain for the rest of the flight. This was not like that at all. They were helpful throughout the flight. I was very impressed.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-26;QR708 IAD-DOH. Seat 3K. Not sure what happened to QR this evening but from the start it is not what one expects from this carrier. My last four trips with QR including this one have entailed lengthy business class check-in waits at IAD. Why can't QR at IAD have enough dedicated business class check-in counters to manage the flow of checking-in passengers in a way that prioritizes high yield customers? Waiting 30 minutes to check-in from the business class line while watching economy class passengers who arrived well after me breeze up to the counter is just not acceptable. QR needs to look at this seriously. This isn't the first time I've encountered this while checking in for this flight at IAD. The flight left early. Turbulence early on delayed the dinner service. However once it started the left aisle of the business cabin was on to their second course before passengers on the right aisle even had a drink. The purser should ensure consistency throughout the cabin. The FA working in my aisle asked if she could clear my service items before I'd even been served the main course. I informed her that I hadn't had dinner yet. When ordering appetizers I was told that one of my appetizer selections might not be available as many other passengers had ordered the same thing. Really? The business cabin is not full and I'm in row 3. My main course for the dinner a lamb shank with root vegetables was entirely under-whelming. When put in front of me the sauces were congealed. Once I started to eat it it was only tepidly warm. The purser came around and asked me how my meal was and I told her it was not hot and that it looked like it had been sitting for a while. I got a nice smile and an I'm sorry Sir but no offer to have it re-heated or replaced. What particularly irked me was that just minutes after take-off the purser went around the cabin summarily closing everyone's window shades. A hand appeared from the row behind me to close the window that I was looking out of at that moment admiring the night time view of New York. There's lots of time remaining just after take off on a night-time transatlantic flight for FAs to go around the cabin and discretely close the window shades before sunrise. Believe it or not some passengers may want to see the night-time lights of New York Boston Halifax or St. John's. If they want to close all the shades early on in the flight they can at the least ask passengers if they want their shades drawn rather than just briskly machine-like marching around the cabin closing them. Passengers typically chose window seats for a reason. Sorry QR not one of your better days.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-21;"MXP-DOH-INC - PEK-DOH-MXP. 3 flights out of 4 on the 777 1 on the 330. Business seat on the 777 far superior compared to the rather cramped and angled 330. What I liked on the 777 seat is the fact that there is plenty of space and no ""foot box"" so you can sleep in any position and have freedom of movement. The 330 had the ""foot box"" which restricts movement and is quite annoying and doesn't go flat. Service on all sectors was excellent as was food and wines. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Having a 7 hour layover on the outbound trip we went on the free Doha city tour which was well worth it. Back in time to relax for a couple of hours in the enormous lounge. Would recommend Qatar but beware of travelling on the cramped 330 business class which is ok for a day flight but not a night flight.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-21;Outbound LHR-DOH-MEL return MEL-DOH-MAN. 3rd time flying Qatar business class. The Qatar lounge at LHR is incredible. Modern well designed comfortable with great staff and fantastic food and drinks on offer. We had a full breakfast with a couple of glasses of champagne and it was a great way to start our vacation. Our first flight from LHR was on the three class A340-600 and I was impressed. This was our first time on this aircraft type with Qatar and I was surprised how spacious it was. The angled lie flat seat was comfortable enough to get a few hours sleep. The galley is at the rear of business class so the front seats get served last. We had a couple of hours to kill in Doha before our next flight to Melbourne. This was our first time at the new Hamad airport. It was great not to have to do the long bus tour of the airport as you did at the old terminal. The business class lounge is really badly sign-posted but we found it eventually. The lounge was impressive but I think I was expecting more. Table service drinks throughout the lounge apart from one proper bar which is located upstairs. Return flights to Melbourne were on the 2 class 777. The space in business is incredible and the lie flat seats are comfortable. First time we've been given the mattresses which you now get with the usual PJs and slippers but only on night flights. I thought the mattress was a nice touch and added to the overall comfort. Our return flight from Melbourne used the Qantas business lounge which was really poor. Uncomfortable and a very poor selection of food and drink. I was glad to get out of there. Our Melbourne departure was delayed by 45 minutes and we only had a 65 minute transfer time at Doha. From my experience great customer service comes into play when things go wrong (like flight delays) and Qatar handled things superbly. We were met as we left the aircraft with details of our transfer gate and the aircraft was held on stand for us until we arrived. Our luggage was fast tracked and I was amazed to see it on the carousel at Manchester airport. The flight to Manchester was on the smaller A330.200 but again a great aircraft (slightly older) with an angled lie flat seat. Food and beverage on all flights was to a really good standard. But what really makes Qatar stand out though is the consistently high standard of service in business class. I was really impressed with this on all our flights and their five star status really is deserved.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;Stockholm - Doha - Nairobi return. A very comfortable trip in new airplanes (Dreamliner for one leg) helpful staff very tasty food and a great entertainment system. The change of planes in the middle of the night is not that great but the advantage is that you quickly go to sleep on the second leg. In spite of the great flight experience I am a bit hesitant to choosing Qatar again given the reports on how they treat some of their staff.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;Dec 15-Jan 1. QR734/556 and 733/557. DFW-DOH-BOM R/T on QR 777 (LR and ER) in business with family over the holidays. I flew Cathay in First from LAX-HKG R/T just a few days earlier and felt that this experience was on par with CX First and in some areas even better - and that says a lot as CX is world class. In my 15 years of top tier business travel this business class experience stood out as the best. Right from the pre departure drinks service to the excellent restaurant style (and quality) meals to the amenities on board (excellent Ferragamo and Armani kits mattress pads duvets pyjamas superb champagnes) to the crew and the world class new lounge at Hamad - this was an experience! The Business/First lounge at Hamad is huge (not Emirates huge) but manageable. The shower amenities (L'Occitane) and the restaurants in the lounge are excellent (yes Krug is still being served in the business restaurant). The bus transfer (once) was in a bus with 8 lounge style sofa seats. A good way to start the new year!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;Manchester-Doha sector.–While boarding had to wait in the walkway leading to the aircraft door as clearing of the aircraft was in final stages of completion unfortunately icy cold gusts of wind were funnelling into the tunnel. However all this discomfort was easily forgotten on seeing the warm and cheerful welcome we received from the two smart cabin attendants at the doorway. As usual Qatar airways aircraft was spotlessly clean. The 2-4-2 seating of the A332 is ideal for couples who wish to have their space remain uncompromised. The seat pitch of ~32” and width of ~18” is better than many other offerings which give a claustrophobic ‘sardine-can’ambience the cushioning is also more comfortable. The IFE has been upgraded to Touch Screen technology and the availability of Wifi is a further value addition. Service by the cabin staff was as good as ever. Flight deck crew also kept passengers updated on relevant flight parameters. Compared to my previous experience the only aspect that has slipped was the catering. On this sector breakfast and a snack were served I had requested a low-salt diet which was complied with in both instances but the quality of the offerings was very average tasteless and just warm the quantity of the serving has also diminished since my last economy class flight. Doha - Islamabad sector. Due to foggy conditions across parts of the North Indian sub-continent the flight was delayed by some 11 hrs. Though the airlines website stipulates that passengers whose transits exceed 8 hrs would be provided hotel accommodation commensurate with their class of travel they were unable to do so in many a case as the airport hotel had been totally booked they did however provide meal vouchers and make the ‘quiet rooms available to the stranded passengers which I feel did alleviate their plight to some degree. The flight left on time according to the new delayed schedule and service on board was as good as always cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful throughout catering quality/quantity somewhat less than previous experiences but quite acceptable. The aircraft was well maintained and the as clean and tidy as I have always experienced with Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;Madrid to Dubai and Muscat to Brussels in Economy and Business classes on various segments. Everyone from ground staff to flight crews was friendly and courteous. Free meals and alcohol were served even in economy class. Personal seatback TVs had a massive selection of films. The flight crews made numerous drink runs throughout the long-haul flights - again this is Economy Class - offering refills even more free alcohol and fresh water. The leg room was very generous the seats extremely comfortable. This airline makes carriers from the USA and even Europe look very bad by comparison.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one. I would use QR again on this route due to their three daily flights to CMB and their OneWorld membership that allows me to earn Avios and Tier benefits as a Sapphire OneWorld member.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-19;I had flown on BRU-DOH-BOM leg which was a nice and enjoyable trip for me. The check-in was quite comfortable for me. Considering the fact that I have some health issues pertaining to my back I was allotted a bulkhead seat with extra-leg space for the BRU-DOH 8 hour long sector. The welcoming by the cabin crew was very appealing and we were served with fresh towels and candies. The in-flight entertainment was also good since they had movies and other audio-visuals in the most updated forms. The food served was very delicious and was specifically served to me as per my special request for food. All the cabin crew were very pleasant and had a smiling face all the time which was very warming for everyone. The only drawback here was that the cabin crew being English speaking could not communicate with the mostly French and Dutch speaking passengers. Overall I recommend it for further trip. I have my return leg with Qatar Airways and will update you soon about my other experience.;POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2015-01-14;LHR – DOH – MAA return on 21st – 31st December ’14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It’s fair to say that our impression of Qatar’s in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average – all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha – Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we’d been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it’s 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats. The fact that its such a small section of economy makes it feel pretty exclusive too. In economy? Fly the A380 if you can!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-14;EDI-DOH-SGN. Short 75 minute transfer in Doha but everything went smoothly. Usual Hugh quality of food drink and service. The only downside was that the AV on the first sector (Dreamliner) didn't work.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-14;MUC-DOH-KUL-SIN-DOH-MUC. My second trip with Qatar Airways. Crew and staff were very good at dealing with their tasks. Very friendly flight attendants. Food and Drinks were ok. 787 is a real dream. Very nice IFE system and also a nice atmosphere in the plane. A330 is also pretty decent but IFE system could be newer. Overall no problems with transfer or baggage. Will fly with them next year too.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-14;SGN-DOH-EDI. Very strange first sector. There seemed to be fewer cabin crew serving our side of the cabin and the guy we encountered most seemed very flustered almost as if it were his first day on the job. The printed menu card was substituted with a photocopied equivalent when our food order was taken and it featured a few changes none of them for the better. They also quickly ran out of rose champagne and one of the white wines. The next sector to EDI was superb particularly the attentive cabin crew.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-11;ARN-DOH-DAC and return in economy. ARN-DOH operated by a B787 and DOH-DAC operated by an A333. We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration. The load factor in Y was approximately 80%. The seats were decent the IFE was modern flight attendants were friendly and attentive and the food was great. Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department. We chose QR because of the low fares and I would recommend them if the price is competitive.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-11;Our flight was Perth Australia to Manchester UK return and it was a pleasure. We had lie flat beds Perth to Doha. These are excellent even if you don't want to sleep but just want to stretch out. The cabin service was the best I have experienced in Business Class. You can have your meals when you want them. The service was always there and always excellent without being obtrusive. We will certainly be flying with Qatar again this year.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-11;Dallas-Doha-Bombay r/t in Business Class. Awesome experience. Excellent seats on B-777 ER/LR superb food (presented first class style - not a tray in sight) awesome lounge in Doha and service from the crew - best I have experienced (and I fly over 150K miles/year with One World). In fact I was on Cathay First a couple weeks prior from LAX-HKG-LAX and this QR service was as good or better (certainly better food on QR business than CX First). Great seat comfort with mattress toppers and duvets and seat massage function Excellent wines (presented restaurant style) and Champagnes - flawless. My wife and 2 kids felt the same way.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-05;ARN-DOH-DAC return in economy. First leg ARN-DOH operated by a Boeing 787-8 was quite excited to fly on the B787 for the first time. We had checked in online so no long queues for us! Boarding was done on-time and efficiently. I was quite impressed with the lighting in the cabin however it felt fairly cramped in a 9-abreast configuration. The flight was about 80% full. Legroom was decent food was great the IFE was great and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Transfer in Doha was smooth the next flight DOH-DAC operated by an A333. Plane change from two class A333 to three class A333. Our chosen seats got changed the staff handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal which was okay nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!;POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2015-01-05;DOH-CPH-DOH-SGN on 18 Dec and 29-30 Dec. 2014. All flights on time. B787-800 DOH-CPH-DOH on B787-800 and A330-200 on the DOH-SGN leg. Food good but much less and of slightly deteriorating quality as compared to previous flights. FA’s professional hard working coping and caring despite the flights were full. Economy on 787 is nothing above normal seats are cramped and exit seats cannot always decline. Gold-tier members recognised in economy (2 out of 3 times). Champagne made available on all flights. Bus-transfers in Doha still frequent and tedious and constitute anti-climax on otherwise spotless trips. New Al Mourjan lounge in Doha huge impressive but lacks personality decorations and toilets. Meals on order.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-05;SGN-DOH on 17 December 2014. I was smoothly upgraded by miles from their Frequent Flyer Program using “QCredits. This was the only leg on business class (out of 4) enabling me to compare with economy. The A330-200 on SGN-DOH business class seats are flat but not fully horizontal (only decline to 165 degrees) making sleeping horrible. Night-kit and nice cotton pyjamas provided. Service top notch and wines in ultra-top class! Food served on demand and excellent but portions have become very small recently and 2-3 dishes are needed to make up a full meal. FA's the most professional alert and caring I have experienced for long time. Now 4 beers to choose among and the 2 champagne offered are exclusive though still beaten by some of the wines served. Cheese plates nice. Granted access to Business class lounge in Doha despite onwards travel was only in economy.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-05;DOH-BKK-DOH-MAN-DOH-BKK. Flew from Doha to BKK on the A380. Booked business class but got an upgrade to 1st. (Been with Qatar Airways for several years). 1st Class is nice on the 380 but I'm not convinced of its value for money compared to regular business class. Food was 'so-so' although choice of beverages is excellent. Cabin crew were wonderful as always. Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again the food was only just adequate. I think they must have changed caterers because only a year or so ago the food was always excellent.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-05;Per-Doh-Mad November 13 Jo'burg-Doh-Perth. All flight except Jo'burg - Doha on 777. The standard of service in business class on all flights was very good. The best being the Doha - Perth flight were the flight attendants were particularly attentive. All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me. Will continue to fly with Qatar as they offer one of the best business class products in the air.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2015-01-05;We flew DXB-DOH-HKT in business return all on the A330 except the last leg on the 787. Very good service from the crew but can be a bit slow in getting drinks and food out. Business cabin is what you would expect from a quality airline like QR very good. IFE is good and food is not bad for airline food. All flights were on time. Business class in the dreamliner is excellent would love to fly a longer route on it. The lounge in DOH is excellent and massive! The Lounge in Phuket is a joke operated by Thai Airways I dont know why QR use it as the lounge beside it which Etihad use is much better. Definitely would fly Qatar again and recommend them.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-31;"Perth - Doha - Manchester 14-15th December 2014. Perth - Doha flight - usual B777. Full flight but cabin crew maintained a good friendly service. Have used Qatar over last few years on this run. Standard of food has gone down quite noticeably and beverage service not as frequent as in past (although a full flight could explain this). IFE very poor and aircraft seemed ""grubby"" (clean but well used). Doha - Man. Airbus 330. Seats tight in width but good IFE aircraft appeared very new. Flight 2/3rds full but cabin service was very poor. Cabin crew sullen only appeared at food serving time and seemed to spend rest of flight sitting on their crew seats looking very unhappy (they did not even appear to chat to each other). Certainly the worst long haul cabin crew i have experienced (the one exception being Iberia on a trip to Argentina). Maybe this was a one off but certainly I will now consider an alternative airline for this run.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-31;I recently flew from Perth to Paris. The attendants were lovely and the food wasn't bad (it has certainly improved since my first Qatar flight). However the movie selection was dreadful as usual. I do not understand why they can't have a good selection of recent releases as all the general movies they show have been seen 100 times! The flight from Doha to Paris was great - comfortable and I love the new Doha airport. Despite the IFE I would still travel to Paris from Perth on Qatar because they have really great take off and landing times both ways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-31;KWI-DOH on newly refurbished A320 with 2-2 lie flat seats angled toward the windows. Great if US carriers could copy this modely especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US. Service was obliging for this one-hour sector. Connected in DOH to IAD on a 777-300 and was in seat 6K. Overall service was good but somewhat slow due the chief purser having to spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with one selfish and disruptive passenger from Qatar who insisted on bringing his toddler up from economy even though the child not was ticketed in business. He loudly argued with the flight attendants including telling them that he was friends with the Qatar Airways CEO. The chief purser handled the situation admirably and the child was eventually taken back with his nannies in economy. This overly entitled passenger though the plane was his own and that he could do as he liked. Food was good. Call button not always answered very promptly. Washroom kept clean. A great product overall.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-31;Flew Dubai-Doha-Colombo with my wife and child in economy. Overall OK food was OK options finish quickly and you have to manage with what is available. Leg room was OK restricted due to entertainment box under the seat. Few things that they may need to look into: Check in staff at Dubai yawning at 8am in morning not as welcoming as we expected. Doha-Colombo sector too cold inside the aircraft for many passengers but repeated request by us to make it a little warmer did not yield any result. Aircraft was clean and well maintained good entertainment system and options. This was 1'st Qatar airline experience will fly them again but not worth becoming loyal to them.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-31;Flew KUL-DOH-CDG-DOH-KUL. Two flights from and to KUL was operated by an A330-200 while both the flights to and from CDG was operated by their all new A380. First leg was a night flight and the crew was fantastic! They were friendly smiling all the way and nit showing the rushing face even though it was quite a full flight. Food and beverages good portions not too small and had a wide selections of beverages as for IFE selections was ok for adults but for kids not very much. On all the other 3 legs crews were very robotic but did their job. The A380 was a great plane seats were spacious enough and modern. Noticed food catered from DOH not that good but still edible... Pilots on all flights landed perfectly but they seem to be mumbling all the time. Price of tickets were very reasonable and affordable. Thumbs up for Qatar Airways!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-22;"Have used Qatar a number of times for Manchester to Perth via Doha and return always in economy. Sunday 14th Dec 2014. First leg on a full to capacity 777. The cabin crew were excellent in dealing with a full aircraft but the IFE was very poor and limited in choice of films. Also I feel that the standard of food served has fallen considerably. The aircraft itself looked ""tired"". The leg Doha to Manchester in an A330 was a contrast. Very nice aircraft with good IFE food still of a very average standard but the real difference was the cabin crew. I got the distinct impression that we were a nuisance and interrupting their rest time. No smiles indeed they were quite sullen and spent most of the flight sat on their seats by the galley not even chatting to each other. I doubt very much that I will use Qatar again.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-22;We flew Bangkok to London return. So with a change in Doha 4 different flights and they all vary. The flights to London were good and especially the first leg with excellent service from the staff. Good food too. But the return was less good. Especially the final leg Doha to Bangkok. We left Doha around 1am and it would have been nice to get a good meal to settle us down for the 6 hour flight but they just brought us a miserable sandwich. 2 hours before arriving into Bangkok - around 10 am - I expected a nice breakfast - nothing too heavy - but the food options were dinner-based - so beef or chicken with veg etc. I think we just wanted eggs or croissants with coffee. I've flown with Qatar many times and I find the service quite variable. The stop-over in Doha bus connections is now a drag.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-18;Flew NRT-DOH-JNB return. The leg between Tokyo to Doha was on a 777. Quite comfortable. Service was excellent and the staff very attentive. The crew definitely put in the added little extra attention that makes the difference. Aircraft very clean etc. Trip from Doha to South Africa on the 787. While this aircraft is rather impressive I found the entire experience heavily marred by the presence of the entertainment box under the seat in front of you. This can really make it nigh on impossible to get into a comfortable position. I had read the reviews and didn't think it would be such a big deal. At the beginning it isn't but after some hours it starts to become a problem. On the way back I was actually relieved to get off the 787 and onto the 777 for the trip to Tokyo. Having said that the service on the 787 was of the same high standard that made up for the seat discomfort caused by the entertainment box. All in all the airline itself is excellent and the service quality very high. Qatar definitely deserve the 5 star rating that they have. Would definitely fly Qatar again definitely. But would try to avoid the 787.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-18;LHR-DOH-PER-DOH-LHR. Flew the 4 sectors on 777-300 ER recently in Economy. They do a lot of things very well but Seating Inflight Entertainment and Beverages really harm their efforts. Seating is reasonable but what a nonsense on all 4 sectors the recline was! Goes back much too far clears any food and drink off of the table into the lap of the person behind I saw it happen twice and had a very narrow escape myself! When food and drink are not an issue the screen on a fully reclined seat is too much in your face. Drinks were infrequent and if you ordered a Spirit mixer eg. gin & tonic they mixed it for you (in varying strengths) rather than give you the standard small spirit bottle and separate mixer. Small point but again not 5 star standard. Inflight entertainment was good but not great. These are like for like comparisons if the price and schedules are better with Qatar then you may prefer to overlook these issues. Drinks and IFE are small irritations but compared to others they are falling short.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-10;QR707 DOH-IAD. Got on board and after an hour informed that the overhead lights don't work and that the crew had informed ground personnel about the problem before push back but that nothing could be done. I would have appreciated being informed by the crew when they introduced themselves that there was a problem with the overhead lights particularly given that it is a daytime 14-hour flights when some passengers may wish to work. Service on board was good. Food was very good well presented and prepared and very tasty. Flight departed on time. Check in easy with lots of staff to greet and provide directions. Overall a good product at a competitive fare for business class from the US to the Gulf States.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-10;I flew London/Dubai and return via Doha in economy class. All 4 legs were on-time or even early! Apart from the Doha/Dubai leg the other flights were only half full so people could spread out and have the centre 4 seats to sleep. However I really would not say it is a five star service! The meals were OK nothing special and the portions not that large. The inflight entertainment was very good in my opinion. No amenity kits with socks or eyeshades for a 6 hr flight! On all 4 legs I found the crews very well groomed professional but not exactly warm and friendly.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-10;Booked MAN-DOH-HKG return. DOH-HKG operated by CX so this review refers only to the MAN-DOH sectors. Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia. However both flights were early and the fares were excellent value even after paying for a change of flights.;NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2014-12-04;"LHR-DOH-CGK CMB-DOH-LHR. 4 sectors on 777/A330/A320/A319 respectively. 777 was superb for comfort - crew overly attentive but not actually good at delivering anything that was asked for. A330 not as good as the 777 and feared the angled flat seat and then had the best night's sleep I've had on a plane! Best flight of the lot for service and food. A320 CMB-DOH with a regional business class seat for 5.5 hour flight worst flight of the 4 despite a lovely crew. Just not a suitable seat for that length of flight - the 2 other flights from CMB are A330 and 777 with a ""proper"" business class seat. I wouldn't do this flight again but it did work with the schedule I needed. Delayed and therefore missed my connection in DOH as India closed it's airspace due to a missile test. Not Qatar's fault and very well handled was re-booked before I checked in on to the later LHR flight. A319 all business class. Comfortable seat OK food not a great crew overly attentive again and far too many announcements. Felt claustrophobic in such a small plane for a 8 hour flight. Suggest QR get a widebody on that flight and make some more money with economy passengers and cargo - would be better for everyone! Overall not a bad experience a good price and I would fly QR if the price and schedule worked.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-04;"Flew PHL-DOH-CMB on Nov 30th and Dec 1st. First time on Qatar. The PHL-DOH flight QR-728 in a 777-300 with bad in-flight entertainment systems. My system (along with many around me) stopped working after about 4 hours into the 12 hr flight. Flight crew promised to ""reset"" my system after completing inflight meal service but never did anything or came back to inform me. After about 2 hours I again informed another flight attendant who ""tried to reset"" with no success. Towards the end of the flight a flight attendant came to me to apologize to say that they have a known technical problem with the system and their engineers will have to look at it in Qatar!";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-04;CGK-DOH-LHR first time flying with Qatar. Selected them solely based on good reviews and 5 star status and wanted to try their new A380 to LHR. CGK-DOH leg was in a B777-300ER quite a new plane great IFE with very big screen on time departure and early arrival in Doha very good inflight service as well. Our flight to LHR was delayed by 2 hours due to aircraft changes. It is no longer A380 but they changed it to an old A340-600 to make the matter worse despite checking in on time and getting our preferred seats (window and middle seat as we are a couple) due to the aircraft changes they put us in the middle seat of 4 between 2 other strangers. The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat? Aircraft is showing its age and entertainment is limited unlike the B777 service was so-so and meals are inedible. Very cramped seats and legroom is not that great compared to B777. They changed the gate twice during the delay and we had to walk from end to end at Hamad International Airport just to find out that our flight was delayed. Not a very good experience especially considering DOH-LHR is one of QR's flagship route.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-01;Flew LHR-DOH-BKK return. Fantastic service very good seat comfort. IFE was very good with a very large selection of movies and TV shows. Meals and snacks were satisfactory and flight attendants were very helpful and attentive. Would recommend.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-01;MXP-DOH-BKK-DOH-BKK - really good. Doha Airport is fantastic and transfer procedures quick and easy. On the 6 hours night flight Doha - Bangkok the dinner is served 1.5 hours after take off and the breakfast 2 hours before landing - no time to rest!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-12-01;DOH-LHR on Qatar 'all business' A319. Half full so it really felt like a private jet with around 18 passengers. I sat in the rear section with one other gentleman so we had about 20 seats to ourselves! However now I've tried it I'll probably revert to the bigger jets next time as they are smoother quieter and more spacious.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-25;QR653 KTM-DOH 10 Nov. First time ever with QR the flight supervisor was attentive and friendly the food of good standard and proportion. The equipment used was an Airbus 320 for a 5 hr flight which was fairly okay. The only negative aspect was the rude and arrogant biz class check in clerk at KTM airport.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-20;IAD-DOH-KWI business class on Nov 9. At check in IAD I asked the agent if there were any infants seated in the first economy bulkhead as I was in the last row of business class. He said there were two infants booked on the flight but both were located at the back of the aircraft. An infant which screamed for the first two hours of the flight was located right behind me. At check in there was an empty seat in the first business cabin that I would have happily taken had I known an infant was seated behind me. Onboard I called the Chief Purser and complained to her. She agreed that the check-in agent should have told me and was going to follow up. At check in there is no reason why the web-check in baggage drop only counter should be closed before the entire check-in counter closes. I ended up behind a huge family traveling in economy with mountains of bags who checked in at the business counter and haggled endlessly over excess baggage charges causing me to wait about 15 minutes to check in - all the while the web check-in counter was unattended. I had a delicious lamb entree from IAD-DOH although the piece of meat was the size of a silver dollar. New lounge in DOH is pretty nice. I had a shower which was available as soon as I asked. Well equipped lounge with lots of dining options and very spread out. DOH-KWI was on the new 787. The interior of the cabin is cool with great ambient lighting and seat comfortable. I like the sparkling rose before take-off. I wish the sector had been a bit longer to enjoy it more. All flights were spot on time.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-20;Flew Melbourne to London via Doha. The flight was pleasant from Melbourne to Doha. The entertainment system wasn't working or up to date. The cabin crew kept resetting the system but it did not work. I was forced to change seats. From Melbourne to Doha it was a good flight - no issues. Don't know whether I would use Qatar again in the near future.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-20;QR122 MXP-DOH QR1365 October 23/24. Qatar level of service food and seating well above average. Cannot fault them unless you ask for the moon. Flights on time staff attentive and polite. Purchased a discounted business class ticket yet extended my stay by 30 days with a small penalty of only 36 Euro!;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-20;8 November 2014 Cape Town to Doha on A330-300 a nice experience. Leg space food and service was very good. Doha to Dubai with the B787 Dreamliner although this is a new aircraft the leg space was bad. On 12 November 2014 return from Doha again with the Airbus A330-300 very nice flight with good service.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-17;Flew for the first time with Qatar from Perth to Dar Es Salaam. Have flown with other airlines in the past. Qatar was adequately comfortable for such a long flight. I ordered a special meal and was still given the option of the regular menu. Was impressed by the range of nationalities of the cabin crew. Someone was bound to speak your language.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-12;"BKK-MAD return with a short layover in new Doha airport. Perfect. From the ease of online booking to check-in from gate to flight services (food is really good and Beverage selection is superb.) Inflight entertainment is Excellent. The headrest that folds makes for a comfortable trip. I am 5'7"" leg room was very adequate even if the person in front reclined. Staff were always friendly and smiling.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-12;First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-12;Have been a regular on Qatar Airways during last 3 years on Delhi-Doha-Lagos. Travelled in Economy and Business. Experience in economy is mixed. Seating is ok in 2x4x2 configuration but less keen on the 3x3x3 configuration which seems cramped. Staff service can be variable on Doha-Delhi sector - especially with people who are not comfortable speaking English. Business class is quite good. Very comfortable. Cabin crew feed you like crazy. Choice of food and wine is good. Ground handling and luggage service is good.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-11;Finally I get to fly on the Dreamliner! And Qatar Airways made the experience world class. As you board the plane you notice your first difference. The entrance of the 787 is very open and grand. You nearly feel like you're walking into a lobby area. Then you notice the windows which are truly big. Love the expansive feeling you get by being so connected to the outside. When you finally get to the new business class seat which has a very spacious 1-2-1 configuration you realize why Qatar is one of the few 5-star airlines. The reverse herring bone layout has you facing into the large windows and has by far the best design I've ever seen given this configuration even in sleep mode. An excellent dining experience. If there is one slight doubt it's with the new IFE system which takes some time getting used to. It's a complete redesign and not always logical. At least to me. Did I mention the spacious lavatories? Their Dreamliner experience is perfection.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-06;Heathrow-Doha-Ho Chi Minh B777-300ER and it was a pleasant and a comfortable journey. Great cabin crew very friendly and polite. The food onboard seems less then last time in 2013 and that was a bit disappointment. Transfer at DOH beautiful new airport great design. Flight from Doha to Ho Chi Minh with the A330. The IFE onboard seems pretty old old seats and no touch screen. Many movies but not so many movies in the action category. SGN-DOH - Pleasant and an enjoyable flight. Landed on time. The problem was that my next flight to Doha- Oslo was leaving 9 hours later so pretty boring to wait so long. Great restaurant and food in the airport. B787 for the next flight. Good flight but I found out that the music didn't work and played different songs to those selected. Food was ok but I wish it was more. I sat on the back and didn't get my choice of food but that was ok. Landed on time at Oslo. I do recommend Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-06;Superb service with Qatar on business class. The only downer is the lounge in Paris which is shared with a few other airlines and offered only packaged snacks and a few sandwiches. Inflight - so nice to be able to choose when we wanted to eat. The food was fresh and delicious and presented to us whenever we wanted. The service could not have been better. Yes and pyjamas and the extras too. Qatar were superb in every way (did I mention the Krug at the lounge in Doha?) If only they flew into Adelaide!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-03;TBS-DOH-MXP. Both aircraft's seemed relatively new but the heating made it unbearable (especially on the TBS-DOH leg). It felt like a sauna and even the crew agreed but couldn't do anything about it. The vegetarian meals I ordered were not inspiring. The light snacks are a piece of sweet and a piece of savoury. The savoury was just OK the sweet was dry and burned i.e: inedible. On board Staff were miss and go. Most of the crew (Asians and Arabs) were friendly and genuinely eager to please but some of the Eastern European ladies were cold and not very approachable. Doha Airport is new and impressive. My connection was 5 hours long and so I went to the Ortyx Lounge that charges around $40 (140QR). The Lounge was very busy (500+ people) and there is only one shower facility. Luckily I found a slot to shower else the onward flight would have been even more awful than the first. I was happy to got an emergency exit seat (10D) on the DOH - MXP flight to discover this was the worst possible choice of seat. It is on an 'angle' and so it provides even less legroom than the regular seats with people going in and out of toilet and the crew bumping into me non stop.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-03;LHR-DOH on new A380 service. Interior very similar to Dreamliner - fantastic seat and big personal screen. Additional storage with side bins on the upper deck. Spent much of the flight in the Bar - very cool and whilst perhaps a bit of a gimmick it was very nice and with great service. Toilets were the poshest I have seen. These planes were a long time coming for Qatar but in my view well worth the wait - only trouble is it will make flying anything else (except perhaps their Dreamliner) a bit of a chore!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-11-03;Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all MAN-DOH-DPS and BKK-DOH-MAN. Took these flights a couple of weeks ago and on every one of the 4 flights the service and the food were indeed 5 star quality. The service in the business class lounge at Doha was also excellent. The only gripe I would have on the flights is that the choice of movies is very poor - Premieres and recent releases I really don't think so.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-31;Manchester - Doha - Bangkok. Check in at Manchester excellent as usual given pass to Escape Lounge which in all honesty isn't the best I’ve been in but as it was almost empty its OK to while away an hour or so plus they come and tell you when your gate is open. Unfortunately the usual carryon once in the departure area of people standing directly in front of the doors despite being told to sit down and wait for the announcements a few passengers tried to follow the wheelchairs through the doors. Priority boarding for business class and silver card holder resisted the temptations to smirk at the clowns still blocking the doorway and headed for the business cabin within a few minutes of boarding a flight attendant had already take my order for a drink so settled down and waited for takeoff. Bangkok to Doha is on Airbus 300 which I actually prefer to the Boeing 777 the cabin is smaller and I think more comfortable senior flight attendant introduced herself to all passengers and we then took off on time. Flight was very pleasant little turbulence so managed to consume all meals watch a few video and doze prior to arriving in Doha. The usual excellent Qatar staff advised on leaving the aircraft that you didn't need a pass for the lounge just to show your boarding card but as I was only in transit for 90 minutes I didn't have much time to spend there. Doha to Bangkok is on the 777 were the economy passengers have to troop though business so it seemed to take ages the cabin was hot and I don't usually feel the heat and stunk of perfume changed in the pyjamas (am I the only person who does) and tried to get some sleep prior to arriving Bangkok were the cabin crew handed out fast track passes on departing the aircraft. The return two weeks later was again a fine flight on both legs of the journey the only problem of your outward / return flight being in the same month is you have the same movies so stuck to the TV shows I'd missed spent almost 9 hours in transit in Doha thankfully the new brilliant new business lounge is open. Between Doha and Manchester I got a nose bleed and within minutes a was being tended to by 5 crew members with tissues towels and a bag of ice. Throughout the rest of the flight whichever member of the flight crew that passed checked I was OK or if I needed anything. I've seen some recent comments that Qatars very high standards have slipped quite a lot my experience is the complete opposite I've always believed their product to be vastly superior to their rivals in the gulf and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Qatar have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked another two flights with my favourite airline.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-31;787 from Doha to Brussels in Business. Just perfect! Great service very friendly staff new lounge excellent. Our first time with Qatar but for sure not the last! Even better than Emirates.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-31;We flew from Washington DC to Doha then on to Perth. We had a wonderful flight. Staff were extremely professional and made the time in the air fly by would recommend Qatar Airways to anybody.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-28;Flew outbound SIN-VIE return ZRH-SIN both transit through Doha. In-flight services and entertainment were good however food were below average for a premium airline. Seating arrangement on the Dreamliner economy class were 3x3x3 found it inconvenient for couples especially seating by the windows. Seating space were just okay for small built any taller than 1.75m might be a tight squeeze. Our inbound transit at Hamad Doha were from remote parking bay. Although bus shuttle to the terminal were smooth we were quite disappointed that such a premium airline felt very much budget oriented. The only consolation was we got the tickets cheap during promotion. The saving grace was flights were punctual for all 4 sectors which is very important to any traveler.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-28;PER-DOH-FRA with return CDG-DOH-PER. All flights on 777-300ER except DOH-FRA which was an older A330-300. This was our first time with QR (would normally use SQ or CX for this type of trip)and we were quite impressed with the overall economy service. Planes were quite clean and well maintained although the A330 was definitely showing its age. We found all staff to be professional and in general were quite friendly even if smiles were a little limited. The economy food was surprisingly good and varied plus of decent quantity. Alcohol limited without asking but always available. Call buttons seemed to get quick attention from what we observed. All flights on time or early except for one which was only 20 minutes late. I found economy seat comfort and legroom acceptable despite being 192cm tall. Very happy the QR 777 is 9 abreast and not the 10 across that some others try to squeeze in. Connection in DOH was a breeze (we had over 2 hours each way). Based on these 4 flights we are happy to recommend QR and will include them in future considerations.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-28;Travelled BKK-DOH-EDI on 10 Sep and was impressed with all aspects of QR. Use of THAI lounge at BKK is a real let down. Inflight service excellent. DOH Business Class lounge excellent. Returned EDI-DOH-BKK on 15 Oct. Flight departure delayed by 1 hour which caused some anxiety given a 1.5h stopover. But this was made up so there was a 55 minute stopover allowing us and our luggage to connect successfully. Inflight service on both sectors excellent. Boarding at DOH chaotic with no accessible separate boarding at gate for Business. Food is OK but not exceptional. But any downsides are certainly made up for by service which is above and beyond.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-28;Just got back from a return trip CPH to Muscat via Doha and must say I am very disappointed! This is first time that I have flown with Qatar. The seats were not very comfortable the food below average and the service onboard mediocre. All in all not impressed.;NEGATIVE

qatar-airways;2014-10-22;My wife and I flew GRU-DOH-SIN on 21/07/2014. The first part GRU-DOH we flew out on a 777-200LR it was clean inside and we loved the full flat bed. The other part DOH-SIN on their new 787 a first time for me on the Dreamliner excellent airplane. Very good seat pitch and width. We had a excellent staff service in both parts. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. Food was tasted fresh and the best airline food we have tasted quite frankly.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-22;Decided to travel Business Class SGN-FCO-SGN last summer holidays (May/June 2014). The experience was great. Hubby and me + 3 kids aged 8 months 5 year-old and 9 year-old. All the crew were really helpful with the kids. They even allowed my baby to sleep on the unused seat. I cannot imagine how tedious it could be travellling with 3 kids but surprisingly everyone in my family was more than comfortable flying Qatar Airways. Will definitely use Qatar Airways again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-22;Fairly disappointed. First class seat was narrow (much smaller than others like LH LX on the same aircraft type). Crew not proactive need to request everything. Food mediocre (compared to Asian airlines in F) no pyjamas no F lounge in DOH (C lounge was relatively good food offerings look impressive but everything is pre-cooked and dried out. Entertainment system needed rebooting and was unreliable.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-20;I've traveled a lot of times to London from New Delhi via Doha and have always enjoyed my experience. The food is good. The entertainment systems provide a varsity of options. The window seats in economy can be a bit inconvenient as there's some plane's equipment under every window seat.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;Doha to Colombo. Plane was a B777 and appeared to be almost new. Flight was 20 minutes late being pushed back and then we spent 30 minutes riding round the airfield no announcement why we were delayed. Business class only half full so service was excellent. Food offered was uninspiring but drinks were good and were refilled regularly. No comfort pack supplied on this flight. Seats were very comfortable and the 777 is in my opinion better than the A330.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;CMB - DOH used the business class lounge at Colombo food was cold and of limited choice. Plane was A321 of reasonable standard business class was half full. Seats were uncomfortable and the leg rest could not be raised when the seat back was in the upright position. Meal provided was reasonable but not business class standard. Not overly impressed with Qatar on this flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;Edinburgh-Doha-Male return. Check completed in under five minutes but surprised no fast track through security Qatar use the No 1 traveller lounge adequate but nothing special. Boarding was quick and staff apologised for small delay whilst a family with young children boarded in front of us. We flew the Dreamliner and had chosen window seats specifically with my partner seated directly behind me. Seat was very comfortable and the general cabin ambience was excellent the cabin layout is 1x2x1. Served a very nice rose champagne after boarding food choice of wines and entertainment all very good. Crew excellent and very attentive flight departed on time was a bit concerned as we had a fairly tight connection but we arrived early into Doha - security was a breeze with a dedicated Business class area and we passed through in under 5 minutes. Had time to make a quick visit to the new lounge and very pleasing on the eye. Onward flight was on an A320 with the newly refurbished cabin seat excellent and very comfortable - even managed a few hours sleep. On arrival and departure from Male they now have a fast track desk for Business class passengers. On return through Doha Business class immigration processing took around 20 minutes the queues for Economy were fairly large and doubt those in that queue would clear in anything under an hour. Checking in at Doha on the return was very quick and Hamad Airport pretty special small queue in front of us so asked to take a seat for no more in 2-3 minutes and a staff member came over and assisted us with the bags to check in. Had more time to see the new Al Mourjan Lounge this time it's very large good choice of food and lots of seating although at 06.00 it was very busy. All in all great experience and would have no hesitation flying Qatar on future trips.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;Flew PER-LHR in Economy early August 2014. Aircraft PER-DOH B777ER. Plane was fairly new clean and comfortable a good flight. DOH-LHR was supposed to be a B787 but was changed to an A340 with no notice. Originally selected 2 seats together (window and aisle) these were changed to 1 window and 1 middle row several rows away. Only found out at online check-in. Managed to get 2 seats together with negotiation with other passengers. Cabin staff did not assist. Return LHR-DOH again supposed to be a B787 was changed to a B777ER. Plane still OK but older. Again seats changed (2 together this time) with no notification and further back than originals. Food a little better than average and cabin staff attentive. Seat leg room good but seemed hard. Overall a good airline- Doha airport is big and roomy but few places to get coffee if you have a wait. No alcohol but that is expected.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;Manchester - Doha business class plane was A330 in good condition. Seats were comfortable and everything worked as it should. We were greeted by name and cabin crew were attentive and friendly. Dine on demand but I was not impressed with the food offered although the wine on offer was very good. Took off on time and landed on time. Have travelled previously with Qatar and am a frequent flyer member but I feel that the level of service is slipping.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;Doha to Colombo. Plane was a B777 and appeared to be almost new. Flight was 20 minutes late being pushed back and then we spent 30 minutes riding round the airfield no announcement why we were delayed. Business class only half full so service was excellent. Food offered was uninspiring but drinks were good and were refilled regularly. No comfort pack supplied on this flight. Seats were very comfortable and the 777 is in my opinion better than the A330.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-13;CMB - DOH used the business class lounge at Colombo food was cold and of limited choice. Plane was A321 of reasonable standard business class was half full. Seats were uncomfortable and the leg rest could not be raised when the seat back was in the upright position. Meal provided was reasonable but not business class standard. Not overly impressed with Qatar on this flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-08;HAN-BKK-HAN on Boeing 777-300 on 1 and 4th October 2014. Flights on time. Check-in in Hanoi and Bangkok smooth and excellent. Lounge access without problem (as gold card holder). Lounge in Hanoi suffer from dormant staff busy with own activities but the airport view is gorgeous and food is plenty though mainly industrial. Onboard recognized and nourished as gold member. New wines in economy and for the first time after 50 flights with QR they changed the beer to Foster from the usual Heineken. So a boring brand replaced by an even more boring brand. However hot snacks were tasty service on board excellent and caring. From BKK till Hanoi 3 days later I was upgraded to business class by 8 only Q-credits (from Privilege FF-Program). What a pleasure in the Airport as fast track gives you better service. The Lounge (they use Thai Airways lounges) was very spacious and quiet but no wines nor champagnes were offered. Food displayed nicely but hardly acceptable except for loads of Chinese dishes (all Chinese tend to go to Thailand these days as they are not welcomed in Vietnam). The QR flight (got seat 1K in a 2x2x2 configuration) and service onboard was very very good and matches that of a 5-stars airline as Qatar retains.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-05;London to Doha return. Economy class just average no signs the five stars advertised on TV. Seats are fine if you manage to avoid the numerous seats that have a box in the foot space. Entertainment system is old and tired. Better with your own tablet. Food basic. Cabin service very slow on both legs of my journey and staff seemed very tired and stressed. Flight almost on time and baggage all safe and sound.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-01;Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge. Now that Qatar have joined One World I may change to Finnair as their prices and travel times are better than Qatar. All in all Qatar is a good product.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-01;A short SHJ-DOH return experience on September 21st 23rd. Overall a very good product excepted the extra-low quality on food (snacks) served on board. A generous 30kg luggage allowance applies increased by extra 10kg offered to Gold Privilege Club members. New HIA Doha Airport is really efficient and comfortable also new Business Class lounge is really fantastic despite of a poor dining offer. Nothing you can compare with grotty Flydubai or Air Arabia's crockery.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-10-01;My husband and I flew a promotionally rated flight(s) from Chicago to Doha and onward to Dubai on 9/14. We then returned on an early flight from Dubai to Doha and back home to Chicago on 9/20. QA is a wonderful airline and we had lots of room in the 777 for our main flights. The flight coming back was packed and the crowd was kind of unruly to board. We were in the back of the plane so among the first to board other than people with kids and first class etc. It was a 14.5 hour trip from Doha to Chicago. A passenger behind us took it upon himself to to chastise my husband for reclining his seat back. We changed seats later as I prefer the aisle. The flight was (other than the passeger) was great - great service leg room entertainment and good food as well. All trips on QA were great.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-28;QR060 MUC-DOH-BKK on 6 September. Boeing 787. I have flown Qatar Airways many times already and always have had a good experience. Started of rather good but then the cabin came to take my dinner order. I asked to have red wine with my dinner after take off however nothing came until I had finished my dinner. The cabin crew said that they had been busy. I was not very impressed with the service but it was only on this particular flight and this particular cabin crew that did not know how to provide a proper service to a premium customer. But my flight from Doha to Bangkok everything was excellent. Therefore on this occasion I would only give Qatar Airways 5 stars out of 10 on Trip Satisfaction.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-19;Among world class airlines and its 5-star competitors like Cathay Pacific Qatar definitely holds its own. This past summer I took a trip from Philadelphia US to HK and the overall quality is definitely quite exceptional. The seats were comfortable enough considering the long flight the leg room was decent for economy class and the food was at least a step up from average. What stood out the most was their customer service both onboard and on theground. Flight attendants readily and frequently serve you drinks or snacks. There was a mishap in my journey in which I was stuck in Doha for a day one of the three options I was given. I will never regret it. They provided complimentary stay at a cozy hotel (along with 3 meals!) and I got to see the beautiful city. The only slight drawbacks was the longer-than-required duration of the flight (not direct route and trip from PHL to DOH was an hour late) and the arrival / departure time gap is short enough to cause problems if the first flight is late but how it played out made it worth the while. Overall worthy of being a top international airline and recommended. Will fly (am flying!) with them again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-17;QR771 from GRU-EZE on 12 Sept. 777-200LR aircraft was in good condition. Boarding was organized with families with kids first and people with special needs. Then Business class and priority customers. The flight originates in Doha so there were people on-board already - they aren't required to disembark on the transit stop. Economy was around 80% full while Business looked 30-40% full. Flight attendants were great! Super friendly - handed out headphones and served a very good meal of either chicken or pasta. AVOD entertainment is fantastic - the 2 1/2 hour flight went by quickly. Bags were unloaded by the time you cleared immigration and I was in a taxi in 20 minutes after disembarking. Always love to travel on Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-14;QR401. AMM-DOH. Flight departed earlier than the scheduled time which was good because I had less than 1 hour to catch the next flight. However two young passengers seated next to me made me uncomfortable. They jumped stood on chairs played with their food annoyed the passenger in front of me cried crossed my seat just to peek into the window and my bag under the seat was nearly drenched in coffee. The food was ok (chicken potatoes green beans in soy sauce). Overall it was a nice flight. QR844 DOH-KUL. I had more than enough time to catch my next flight. It was not a full flight so I got the whole aisle row to myself. For the first time in my life I could lay down completely on a flight. The food was great (noodles again in soy sauce). The sandwich offered was OK. One of the FAs was nice we had a chat during boarding.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-14;DXB-DOH-MAN one way with 2 kids 7 Sep. Short flight to Qatar was ok staff friendly and helpful. DOH-MAN - plane older but bassinet seats good for kids. Seats uncomfortable to get any sleep in economy. Staff very helpful throughout journey. Food was excellent tasted fresh and the best airline food I have tasted quite frankly. Good activity pack for kids.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-14;We traveled from Philadelphia to Singapore this summer. Flights were enjoyable both ways. Crew was excellent but at times they get too comfortable and not attend to basics - my little one did not get a toy or anything though the attendant paid much attention to one family with a baby on our flight back from Doha to Philadelphia). The first issue we had was with the transit first leg it was about 19 hours Qatar Airways did not provide transit accommodation. We paid USD 125 each to get the transit accommodation (beware of the limitation of the allowance for Meals even with this paid service ours covered only 2 meals which was not that great in Swiss-belhotel) on the return journey it was an hour and a half with long walk between terminals to security check and back to gate there was no consideration for short transit passengers. Second issue was with food preference we had 2 vegetarian meals ordered which were not offered on way to Singapore though I had talked to Attendants they confirmed our meal preference. but asked me to talk to a Supervisor in one of transit gates who promised it will be corrected in other legs which did not help much. I will consider flying with them again due to convenience flying out from Philadelphia.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-10;Flew IAD-DOH-SHJ (Sharjah outside Dubai) during a promo sale in mid-May. Food quality and entertainment options were phenomenal. Movies were up to date and seat width and legroom was decent. Comfortable cabin atmosphere on the long-haul legs and good cabin service. My requests for snacks and ice cream were honored and added satisfaction to the flight. The repeated on-screen play of the menu was disruptive to IFE though. Appreciated the youth and gentleness of in-flight staff especially on the short-haul flights. Even the short-haul flights had delectable snacks. The only trouble was the since-decommissioned Doha International Airport was not sufficient to handle QR's busy network and operations. Had we not seen monitors in other parts of the airport we would have definitely missed our flights. QR's flights to/from the States tend to be pretty packed because of service to/from South Asia.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-06;Up coming trip. LHR-DPS Booked First 380 Biz 787. Late delivery 380 so changed to 777 no issue but downgraded to Biz. with no communication from Qatar of downgrade. Only found out when I checked reservation online. Speedy refund after contacting reservations. 787 also changed to 330 with the dreaded angled seat. LHR-DOH leg now changed again this time 340 angled seat. Resigned to the fact won't be getting much sleep. Never had problems with Qatar in the past. If I had known 340/330 combo with no flat bed would have booked SQ. My scoring is based on past experiences on 777 only not the older 340 330.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-06;27th July Melbourne - Doha QR905 Boeing 777-200LR. 28th July Doha - Paris (CDG) QR39 Airbus A346. 18th August Venice QR130 to Doha Airbus A320v. 19th August QR904 Doha to Melbourne Boeing 777-200LR. Recently travelled 4 business flights. The catering was very ordinary. The champagne and beer were both warm the food was not eatable. I ordered a fillet and received a fruit platter. When fillet finally arrived it was tough and chewy and I couldnt eat. I couldnt even cut through. My Inflight Entertainment on one leg was not working. The movies are very old and very few new shows. The staff although very pleasant do not seem to be that helpful. The seats were very comfortable. I had to ask for pyjamas and no-one offered to put my fitted cover over seat. Good quality champagne what a waste. Overall very disappointing.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-01;HKG-DOH and DOH-LHR on 12/8/2014 MAD-DOH on 27/8/2014. HKG-DOH: Flew on a 11 year old A330-200. Although the plane was 11 years old it was new and clean inside. New touchscreen entertainment system many new films and a wide choices of films. Food was excellent however the cabin crew should smile more. DOH-LHR: A 7year old B777-300ER. Flight was delayed by about 30 minutes. Entertainment system was almost the same but it wasn't sensitive. Meal was not bad but the first sector was better. Excellent service the cabin crew smiled a lot. MAD-DOH: A 4 year old B777-300ER. Entertainment system was more sensitive. Excellent service and meal. Seat was comfortable and the legroom is good. Qatar Airways is my first choice when I go to Europe next time because of its 5 star service!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-01;Economy Paris to Doha and then Business from Doha to CPT. Flight from Paris left late so I missed my connection in Doha. Ground staff waiting on my arrival to take me to transfer desk to make alternative arrangements. All done very professionally. Put on the following day's flight and overnight in a hotel in Doha at no additional cost. Doha's new airport is stunning. I used the business lounge on the morning of my revised flight and it was spacious modern with great food. The flight in business to CPT was superb. Very comfortable seat in the new Dreamliner with excellent entertainment attentive staff and good food options. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-01;Flight from Edinburgh to Singapore via Doha. Seemed like an amazing price for business class both ways and on a 5 star airline. Flights out were on new planes and very comfortable however cabin crew were tiring always fussing. maybe that's 5 star treatment but I don't like it. Flight back was on a not so new plane from Doha to London and not very comfortable I'll stick with BA premium economy out and business back in the future as its cheaper and all in a better experience. My colleague went Emirates business for around the same price as Qatar Airways and reported a very good experience.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-09-01;Flew Edinburgh to Doha on flight QR0028 Doha to Colombo QR0660 again Colombo to Doha QR 0663 and Doha to Munich QR0057. For most of the sectors Boeing 787-8 Jet and Boeing 777-300ER Jet were used. Those were superb flights with amazing facilities except QR 0660. Crew and flight attendants also were fairly good. Flight QR0660. It was like an old bus there was no AC when we were on board. One hour was taken to fix the AC. This flight must not be used for international service it should be used for domestic service. I started from North America via Europe Middle East to South Asia. We expect comfortable service throughout all sectors.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-28;First leg QR1366 JNB-DOH on new Boeing 787-800. Efficient online check-in and friendly staff at baggage drop off. IFE system worked properly and crew was welcoming but not very friendly just did their job. Special ordered meals were served but drinks were only served twice! Flight was on time. Second leg QR67 DOH-FRA on Airbus A330-300. Staff was welcoming and helpful. IFE did not work properly (crashed several times). Ordered meals were served but tasted horrible. Moreover the amount was much to less. Again drinks were only served twice (during breakfast and lunch). I felt a bit ignored by the crew when I wanted a third drink which in my opinion should be served on a flight of seven hours. Flight arrived on time in Frankfurt.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-28;Paris to Doha Business Class 15 August 2014. As always with Qatar Airways the crew and flight attendants were excellent. The service as everything else about the flight is on a good or excellent level. Difficult to find better ratio quality/price at least on this route Europe to Asia/Pacific.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-26;Economy from Cape Town to London via Doha. Extremely pleased. New 787 to Doha and found it very comfortable good leg room quiet and spacious overall. Older 340 to London but again comfortable and spacious. Easy transfer at Doha in the new airport. Staff on board very helpful and attentive. Food ok - but the hot snacks rather unpalatable. Recommended for the price and comfort. Both flights completely full.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-26;Flew Perth to Doha to Manchester return which I do a few times a year. The planes where all very clean we flew an A330 and B777. The seat quality was one of the best I have had. The biggest let down for me and why I will not be using Qatar again was because I am an emerald one world flyer I was greeted by a member of the cabin crew who took my meal order only to find when the meals were served I was asked again as my preference was no longer available. I explained I had made a previous order being an emerald member. This was also the case for the fast track lanes at passport control no fast track passes handed out which it states in the one world privileges. Doha airport is so much improved easy connections and very clean and professional.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-11;MXP-DOH (A320 business): Flew the refurbished A320 with the new flat-seat beds. Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing. Furnished well but lacking in refreshment offerings. delays for transfers at DOH. Still will probably fly Qatar again if the opportunity arises.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-08;Flew 2 sectors: Islamabad - Doha QR615 Doha - Manchester QR23. 1st sector on 773 - very clean and well maintained cabin excellent IFE and very welcoming and attentive cabin staff flight very smooth and superb landing at Doha. 2nd sector operated by A333 aircraft cabin clean and well maintained - comfort levels very good for a ~9 year old aircraft A7-EAH IFE acceptable needs upgrading. flight was smooth from take off on schedule to a normal landing before time. Arrival at gate was delayed by ~ 30 min for no fault of the airline rather due to a 'hoax' which was dealt with in an excellent manner by the authorities and exceptional professionalism demonstrated by the flight crew as well as the cabin crew. Only drawback was that the breakfast served on both sectors though well prepared was exactly the same.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-06;Flew LHR-DOH-RGN HND-DOH-LHR. The LHR-DOH was on a refurbished A330 so the flight was pleasant with a good sized IFE screen and a sufficient selection of films. However the letdown on this flight was the catering which was a running theme throughout all of the flights as well as the attitude of the cabin crew who looked as if they did not want to work. The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets. The crew also didn't help the flight by not smiling and ignoring the call button for passengers. All in all I was dissatisfied with Qatar Airways.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-06;QR674 28th July 2014 QR675 2nd August 2014. Good quality airline in business and first class. Service not up to top tier carriers for economy service. Online booking/check-in service prone to failure.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-06;Have flown Qatar Once round trip from Dubai to Bangkok would want to fly with them on trips to the U.S. but they have no stopovers in Europe to break-up the flight. Could not sit on plane for 15hrs. Service was great food was good overall equal if not better then Emirates at a cheaper price. Would fly again if flight no more than 7-8hrs.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-06;DOH-IST Airbus 330. Food and beverages very good staff attentive. The movie choices were disappointing - being very old for the current months entertainment suite.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-03;DOH-JED-DOH. Qatar Airways offers a Business Class layout as First Class on this route we flew out on a 777 and returned on their new 787-8 a first time for me on the Dreamliner personally I would call my review a mixed review. No one can fault Qatar Airways class of service they are top notch from the moment you enter into the airport to the moment you pick up your luggage and head home my only draw back is surprise surprise the Dreamliner. The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully. There is plenty of storage room on the seat but the operating system of the entertainment is a little complicated. I hope that Qatar Airways review the layout of their new A350.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-03;LHR-DOH-BKK and back. All sectors operated by B777-300ER except DOH-LHR which was an A340 (old plane and really showed its age). QR have serious communication issues when it comes to being delayed and all flights (except the one leaving BKK) were delayed by at least 40 minutes if not more. Hamad international airport was nice and new but unfortunately very chaotic if you have a tight connection. Food was probably the best thing on QR - quite tasty for airline food! FA's really varied on each leg - some were just sitting/standing around chatting amongst themselves and were clearly not interested in customer service whereas others tried their best to deliver. Inflight entertainment was pretty good on 777s. Plenty to choose from but pretty much the same film/TV choices a month later and remote control on A340 stiff and unresponsive. Seats were a little on the uncomfortable side though lots of legroom compared to other carriers. The 2-4-2 config on the A340 definitely suited my companion and I more than the 777's 3-3-3 layout. Overall pretty average.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-03;One way from BOM-DOH-DFW in economy. The seats are good but food and drink offerings were meagre. I was actually hungry in the later half of the flight. Staff seemed disinterested. I was expecting. Not sure if this is a one- case scenario but was expecting a bit more from a 5-Star rated airline.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-08-03;On 24/7/2014 I travelled Business Class from Melbourne to London Heathrow via Doha. The first leg of the journey on QR905 was relatively OK but on arriving at Doha with a 2 hour wait for my next flight I went to the business class lounge where I was abruptly turned away as apparently there was no room left. I was left unable to shower or purchase any refreshment and had no option but to wait at the gate for my flight. The flight was delayed due to waiting for other passengers which resulted in a very unpleasant time sat on the aircraft. The service on board was OK but the toilets were not cleaned. My monitor kept sticking and despite being reset would not function properly. I feel very aggrieved that I paid for a business class flight and received economy treatment - I have yet to receive a response to my email from Qatar Airways.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-31;"My family and I flew PNH-Manchester then CDG-PNH both with technical stops in HCM and transit in DOH. Generally speaking the inflight service was good but the food on all 4 sectors was bad. Passengers on all 4 flights were mostly Westerners and Westernised Asians like my family and yet the food was quite Indian Middle-eastern - oriented relatively spicy. I know that one should not expect too much from airline food but having flown on many airlines around the world I expected more from an airline that positions itself as ""the 5-star airline"". Likewise it's a shame that Qatar has just inaugurated a state-of-the art airport in DOH but Qatar Airways ground staff in DOH failed to implement universal policies that are clearly advertised in their Website e.g. to give priority boarding to passengers accompanied by young children.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-29;Three of us flew between Cape Town and Casablanca via Doha in July 2014. The ticket price was very good. The leg from Cape Town and Doha on a new Boeing Dreamliner was excellent. The airport in Doha is brand new and there are excellent facilities for transit passengers. The flight from Doha to Casablanca was problematic. There was a 3.5 hour delay due to a faulty AV system on a rather old Airbus aircraft and the passengers had to endure a fair amount of discomfort as a result of this. The return flight from Doha to Cape Town on the Dreamliner was also delayed due to late arrival of the incoming aircraft and an electrical problem on the aircraft. The latter surfaced when the aircraft dropped passengers off in Johannesburg and had to depart to Cape Town. The food was average. Especially the light snacks were unsatisfactory. The crew members were very helpful and professional.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-29;"I am a ""very frequent"" flyer traveling every other week on long haul flights. Last week I took Qatar Airways for the first time Madrid to Bangkok via Doha. The experience was the best business class experience I have had. The seats are very comfortable and the space between seats the largest I have seen in a business class cabin. It is true that the layout does not give you much privacy if you are traveling alone. The service and the food were excellent especially on the Doha to Bangkok flight. The only downturn was the Doha airport lounges were not available. We were given 300 Qr vouchers for food and shopping which was quite nice. Overall excellent experience.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-29;NBO-DOH-JFK. Fabulous experience in our view better than BA First Class. Food was excellent wines were superb and service on both legs was outstanding. IFE worked perfectly and had plenty of variety. Both flights on time. Our connection in DOH was too short to visit the lounge.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-27;HBE-DOH in First DOH-BKK in Business. Firstly the positives both flights were fine although at Doha on the BKK sector flight we waited on the aircraft for more than an hour without the APU running so very hot. HBE to DOHA half empty DOHA to BKK very full. There were lots of free upgrades in Business can tell by the yellow luggage tag. Qatar should vet upgrades carefully as these people walked around without shoes and were generally noisy. Doha Lounges are a total mess that is an understatement. No room poor food service very poor. No pre boarding for Business class just get with the rest attitude. I would not use Qatar again until they sort out the new airport.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-27;No communication around plane type changes ie A380 due online at time of booking 340-600 actual aircraft flown with no pre warning. Munich-Doha on 787 was excellent with great seating and service limited meal choice. Doha- Kochi upgraded to first as economy over sold and all bumped up one grade. Poor service and check in facilities in Kochi on return. Business seat very uncomfortable similar to Aer lingus who are currently changing. Doha-LHR business on 340-600 instead of original listed 380. No lounge available in Doha tried to pay for upgrade due to poor seating in business no paid upgrade available. When on plane no first class service available on Main route. Limited meal available again difficulty sleeping because uncomfortable seat.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-20;I flew from London Heathrow to Guangzhou Baiyun. The trip was the best economy class long-haul flight I have had. Starting from check in I checked in online the night before my trip. At the airport the ground staff who checked me in were very friendly. Because I had a short transfer flight to catch 1.5 hours after handing in Doha they put a label of rapid transfer on my checked in luggage. The first flight from Heathrow to Doha only 30% of the economy class were seated and basically every passenger had a row to lie down. The dining service was great cabin crews were extremely nice even though you ask them to get you another drink several times they didn't have any printed forms of menu they present you a menu on your personal IFE screen. The flight to Guangzhou was pretty much the same but with less choice of food and more crowded.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-20;As a million miler with one of the Star Alliance carriers this was my first time on QR and I was completely underwhelmed. QR837 BKK-DOH overnight. Business cabin half full yet call button repeatedly went unanswered. FA screwed up my breakfast (so I got none). Flat bed seat seemed to curve downward at both ends and had lots of hard metalic edges which required an additional blanket to soften. Meals were minuscule. I understand small portions on an overnight flight but if you are hungry you are out of luck. I'd heard so much about the fabulous first and business class lounge in DOH. I must be in the wrong place (even though I have been told by two staff that this is the only QR lounge in the airport). What a disappointment. No particularly comfortable seating very little privacy meagre drink and food offerings no organized system for getting a shower - seems to be catch-as-catch- can. I wonder if their famous premier lounge I'd heard so much about is under renovation or something. I expected much more than this.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-20;My family did a European tour so we flew HYD-DOH-LHR and on the return FCO-DOH-HYD. First the flights between HYD-DOH are single aisle on A321 feels cramped IFE is just passable but food was a big let down. We arrived at the brand new Hamad International airport so the airport experience was excellent although very quiet. On flights between DOH and LHR (on A340-600) and FCO-DOH (on A330-300) there was a problem with the air conditioning at DOH so it was like an oven until the flight took off to LHR. In FCO the flight was parked in the middle of nowhere so the boarding experience was terrible. IFE was a shocker - no touchscreens and an inspiring collection of movies and shows. The food was terrible. On the bright side cabin crew were friendly the seat configuration and space factor was really comfortable. Again on the down side: no mood lighting no hot towel no menu card and plastic spoons and forks is not what I expect from a five-star airline.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-17;BKK-DOH-EDI and LHR-DOH-BKK. First leg was on 777-300 then 787 and 319 from LHR. Service is first class. Seat is wide and comfortable only thing was that they did not provide any mattresses so the seat was sometimes a bit hard. The 319 from London is an excellent experience along with the impressive LHR Lounge. Overall Qatar Airways service is very impressive.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-13;As frequent flyer from Azerbaijan to SE Asia and Australasia over the last 15 years I'm delighted that Qatar now fly from Baku cutting out the change in carriers. Lounges: Very poor. GYD DOH and BKK are not pleasant. Emirates leave you so far behind in pre-flight care. Boarding: At both GYD and DOH when flying to GYD it is a scrum. No pre-boarding for BC and very little interest in premium passengers until we're onboard. I pay a lot of money for my flights and I expect a little bit more than QR provide here. Inflight: Staff are great service excellent movies and videos don't change often enough and food is a big problem. Many customers have been traveling for a long time before the airport and when you put us in a lounge where the snacks/food is atrocious we are looking to be fed onboard. To wait six hours for a breakfast is ridiculous given that you only provide a snack after boarding. All in all not bad but some of your rivals really are so much better in many aspects. At least you provide genuine BC seats in the short haul sectors unlike some other carriers. If Emirates started flying into GYD tomorrow you'd lose me and most of my fellow passengers.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-13;I booked six Qatar Airways flights which were from London to Bahrain via Doha. In general I have no adverse comments to make about the economy service and the crew have always been pleasant. In fact the economy service is better with Qatar than a lot of other carriers. However it has been a nightmare on all but one flight with the air conditioning not working on the ground during boarding either in London Doha or Bahrain. As boarding takes a long time the temperature in the cabin reaches a very high temperature due to the confined space and the amount of people on board. Then the crew close the doors and still there is no air con switched on. We taxi out and now there is minimum air coming through but the air is hot not cold. When I have asked the cabin crew what is happening on these flights they always say the same thing - it is like this on all our flights and the cabin won't get cool until we have taken off. Such a shame because their economy service is good.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-06;DXB-DOH-CDG. June 26th afternoon flight. New Hamad Intl Airport was most welcome for this Ramadan travel back to Europe. QR lounge for Glad and Silver transit passengers in Economy still not available but this glitch has been compensated with 5.000 Qmiles and a $30 gift voucher. Good staff on both leg but food was inedible (Chinese style fried beef with rice and vegetables) just like in a bad canteen. Nice beverage selection and great staff however despite a very rude hostess on DOH-CDG leg. 77W equipment was also highly appreciated.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-06;LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg. Both flights on time.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-03;MLE-DOH-JFK: The MLE-DOH segment was on an A320 (my least favorite aircraft) but the First class configuration was brilliant and extraordinarily comfortable. I am die hard Boeing individual but the 4+ hours on this airbus were great due to the comfortable seat great service and absolutely seamless experience flying Qatar was in this segment. From DOH to JFK I was on a 777-300. Honestly every star given to this airline is clearly deserved. Staff are professional. Great entertainment (but now even horrible American carriers have it) and yes kudos on the right temperature of food and champagne (concept foreign to all American carriers).;POSITIVE

I cannot imagine myself flying some else when traveling to the ME and beyond.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-01;Cape Town to Barcelona: QR 1366 on 18 June 2014 Cape Town to Doha. QR 139 on 19 June 2014 Doha to Barcelona. After reading many less favourable reviews on Qatar Airways we feared the trip when we were delayed at Cape Town before even embarking. However a pleasant crew outstanding service a well maintained Boeing 787 an on time landing in Doha changed our views. The transfer was quick and easy and the onward flight to Barcelona as good as the first. We will follow the route again!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-01;Flew Qatar from BCN to Doha the new airport then from Doha to BKK on June 1 2014. I was in business class. The first plane was an Airbus 330 with Lie flat seats. The service was fantastic! The seats were extremely comfortable the monitor was quite large. Everything about this flight was wonderful. Next segment was on a B777-300 and the seats had even more room! Fantastic lie flat beds excellent service. They don't feed you like they used to but the meals were fine service was very good. I would highly recommend this airline and service. You had tons of movies to choose from that were all recent releases as well as some older ones. The inflight entertainment system was very good. The monitors were at least 16”. They offered me pyjamas on the second leg to change into they provided very nice pillows and blankets on both flights as well as a nice amenity kit.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-07-01;13/14 June 2014. CPT-DOH-LCA. First flight (CPT-DOH) on a new 787 I was very excited for my first flight on a Dreamliner but was rather disappointed by the poor seat pitch and width being 1.9m tall (6'2) I was very uncomfortable and unable to sleep the whole way. The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey. Luckily flight was only half full so I had an entire row to myself. Extremely good fare on entire trip.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-25;Flight from Doha to Melbourne was excellent most comfortable bed I have encountered in Business Class. Service meals and Pyjamas all exceptional - Flight QR904 22nd June 2014.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-25;Flight QR210 - Budapest to Doha 21st June. Appeared to be a very old plane seats were hardly much better than economy hardly any foot room I am rather a large person (which is why I chose Business class) but the seat belt didn't fit table wouldn't come down across my stomach TV was too uncomfortable to watch and anyway my earphones didn't work (seat 1A) so very glad it was only a 4 hour 50 minute flight. I couldn't eat anything as the table was too uncomfortable. The Flight crew were very pleasant though so pleased I was transferring to a 777 at Doha I couldn't have stood being in that plane for any longer. The onward flight to Melbourne was amazing and would recommend Qatar for Doha/Melbourne leg (unlucky I got that aircraft I guess).;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-25;QR 1365 DOH-JNB - lounge access but disappointing food available was very poor. Messy and not appealing or comfortable. Left my laptop in security in DOH was not able to return to look so security followed up but to no avail. Pilot was patient but still they did not find. On route to Johannesburg they found it and put it on the next flight then on to Cape Town for us where we were able to organize a courier to return to us in Plettenberg Bay.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-25;Taif to Doha 18 June TIF-DOH QR 1207. Doha to Bangkok 18 June DOH-BKK QR 822. The first leg was First class on an Airbus 321. Small aircraft and got shaken a round a bit during fine weather. The service was outstanding. Only 2 people and a family. The cabin supervisor went out of his way to please us. No Alcohol on the first leg. The second leg fro Doha to Bangkok was again exceptional service. The food was hot of and extremely high quality by any restaurant standard yet alone up in the air at 39000 feet! The cabin staff were pleasant always had a smile and nothing was too much trouble. Both the supervisors and staff on both legs should be commended for their efforts. The new airport was a pleasant surprise with no buses. No problems accessing the premium lounge Plenty of drink and food available even though it was a little bit busy. Be prepared to walk a long way to get there and to the gate. However they give you plenty of warning when you are due to board. They scan all passengers in the lounge. You should not be overlooked. Best of all was the smoking lounge where in this politically correct world we live in was a bonus. It is isolated so those of us who wish to smoke can do so in peace. Hats off to the entire experience. I will choose no other airline if it flies the route I am taking. The new airport is big and will take some getting used to.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-23;A real mixed bag - some staff friendly and courteous with good English language skills and some staff having none of the three and being flat out rude. Most planes do not have enough toilets on board with long queues being common. Food standard quite decent for a plane but drinks service is not nearly frequent enough. I waited two hours during a flight for someone to come past with the little drinks tray that they usually provide and in the end had to push the call button to get a drink! It took them 10 minutes from the button being pushed to arrive. The amenities kit is excellent with the ear plugs being a rare and thoughtful addition. Not sure I would fly again not with so many other options available for similar money.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-23;Perth-Doha-London 23rd May. Barcelona-Doha-Perth 8th June. All on 777 apart from Barcelona-Doha on 330. 777 comfortable and great seat pitch. 330 comfortable but entertainment remote in awkward position in armrest. Flights on time. Crew generally very pleasant and reasonably efficient. Food from Perth to Doha lovely. Then breakfast on arrival and departure from Doha which were fine but nothing special. Food on both return flights really not good didn't eat much of it which is not like me! Strangely didn't mind the old airport too much this time despite the long bus trips. Returned through the new Hamad airport which seems like a big improvement especially the aerobridges but didn't really feel fully finished seemed like half of the lights still weren't functioning yet. Overall a reasonably pleasant trip especially given the good price we got the tickets for.;POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2014-06-23;FCO-DOH-BKK and vice versa. Finally a new hub but after I've traveled this month with LH AF and BA I had a lot of expectations. No meal menu on 3 of 4 flights. On the 6 hours night flight the second meal was served very early (more than 2 hours before the landing) so no one was able to rest.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-16;SGN-DOH-NBO on 14 June 2014. Metal was A330-200 and A320 respectively. Both flights on time. Lounge access granted in SGN and DOH due to my status card to the airline. Got the seat I wanted and when on board I got assistance by FA to remove intruders encroaching my row. Opportunity to flat out on both sectors. A dinner served after midnight was of poor quality (warm snack) but edible. Champagne offered in economy class upon request. Staff alert and welcoming. New airport in Hamad Doha is still a mess too many staff that don't know how to help lots of bottlenecks too few toilets too few lounges (many pax denied access due to fully crowded lounges). Those denied were given “gift-vouchers” which force them to queue up for long time to actually get them. Many regional flights and “small destinations like NBO are still not accessed directly by gates but require the usual awful humiliating imprisoning bus-rides. QR are still delivering FA and ground staff are world class. However the food quality is sliding a bit and the concept on board could need some refreshing. No choice on beers. Wines are acceptable and provide 4 choices plus champagne on some sectors.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-13;Six of us took the segment from Singapore to Doha followed by Doha to Sao Paulo. The 787 that flew us from Singapore to Doha was brand new and very comfortable. The long flight from Doha to Sao Paulo was comfortable too. The flight didn't feel long as we were sleeping quite comfortably and there were lots of TV programs/movies to tie us through. Much more comfortable than we thought. Both flights have USB charging point so you can charge phones/laptops. Crews were friendly. The seat that I was on (Doha-Sao Paulo) had faulty inclination though it couldn't sit straight. Would be good if such defects were rectified prior to the long flight as I could not sit upright during take off and the stewardess thought that I didn't follow the instruction.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-13;"KIX-DOH-DXB. Truly a 5-star experience even in economy. Excellent fare. On KIX-DOH leg with 330 Airbus wide seats plenty of leg room. Two complete delicious meals with choice on flight departing 11 pm arriving 4.30 am. Friendly hard-working cabin attendants Nice amenity bag excellent variety of seat-back entertainment. On DOH- DXB leg with 321 Airbus served breakfast on one-hour flight. New Doha airport was not ready so experienced ""unique"" bus transfers from and to aircraft in the middle of the desert-handled efficiently.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-12;Degrading the Business Class experience at the new airport in Doha and Business Class passengers will no longer have automatic access to lounges at departure and transfer - I know of no other airline doing this. Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good. Entertainment systems breaks down and needs to be restarted. New seats are very good too.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-10;QR006 from London to Doha then onward to Amritsar (India). Flight from Heathrow was poor. An old airbus A330-200. The seat pitch was bad. Not comfortable. The IFE was ancient. The control was fixed in the arm rest so navigation was hard and you had to press it hard a few times in order for it to function. The Hollywood selection was good but the world cinema choices were poor. The food was exactly the same as I had 2 years before on the very same flight. It was tasteless. The crew were good just did what they had to. The flight from Doha to Amritsar was much better on a new Airbus A321. IFE was faster and easier to use but same movies. Arrived on time in India. On the return the flight was overbooked at Amritsar and after much confusion was put on Air India which was surprisingly better than Qatar Airways.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-08;Business class pax travelling from Perth to Madrid 1st June. Check in smooth and efficient lounge at Perth good. Boarded flight and welcomed by crew. Pre takeoff drinks supplied during flight Perth sector crew executed duties well although robotic and little interaction with pax until a smile before landing at Doha. Food was good wine list selection excellent and well presented. On landing at Hamad international what a disappointment after all the delays in the opening of facility. Doha to Madrid what a difference in the crew the service was excellent as the first leg but much sharper and the interaction by the crew with the pax was excellent. Coming from a hospitality background I would want this crew working for me menu choices good and wine list choices good our thanks to the crew for making this sector a very pleasant experience.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-08;Singapore-Athens via Doha return. Mix of aircraft 777-300er and A330-200 outbound returning on A320 and 787. Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand. I travelled with a colleague who was flying Qatar for the first time I doubt he will fly them again because of the airport experience. Really was a major let down.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-08;LHR-CMB-LHR. All flights (4 sectors) delayed. Ran for first connection and made it. Return got to gate and aircraft still boarding but told I was disconnected as baggage would not make it. 6 hour wait as next LHR flight also delayed. Connection time was 50 minutes on ticket yet told unless 40 minutes free cannot make connection. Why sell a ticket leaving a 10 minute space to make a connection. New airport too big and had to run 1/2 mile at least to get to next flight. Rude ground staff who have no idea how the new terminal works. On board no printed menu menu on screen not available for 4 flights taken small portions of food and plastic cutlery paper cups no wow factor in any way. Cabin crew polite and did try and entertainment good. cloth hot towels no overnight shades/toothbrush. I will not fly this airline again.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-05;I flew 2 sectors in business - Jo'berg to Doha on the new 787 and Doha to Madrid on the older 777. Seat configuration is different but good on both - flat beds but more space on the 787. Both flights were delayed in departure - not so impressive. But the big letdown was the food! IT was (apart from KLM business) the worst business class food I have ever had! Stodgy unimaginative and dull. Service was odd - my post take-off drink was forgotten despite being written down and staff were surly and sullen.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-04;Cape Town-Doha-New York and return: Excellent experience all-round. Charming and helpful cabin crew great entertainment (especially appreciate being able to view while landing). One point though: please don't run the menu for 45 minutes - 5 minutes will suffice! (Doha - CPT). Special mention of our stay over (courtesy Qatar) at Retaj Hotel Doha. Surprisingly fabulous hotel with great food added to our travel experience and even motivated plans to incorporate a visit to Doha which we had no idea was so beautiful on future travels.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;Flew QR252 and QR9. (TBS via GYD - tech stop - via DOH) First leg was on an A320. I was in row 8 so had a nice amount of leg room. IFE was a little unresponsive but since the flights were short it wasn't a problem. Food was up to the usual QR standard and cabin crew were friendly and professional as usual. Second leg was an A333. had an aisle seat so leg space was restricted due to the IFE box under the seat in front. IFE kept sticking but since it was a night flight I slept most of the journey. Crew were friendly and professional as the usual standard. Catering was just OK on this leg. The new airport makes transiting a breeze.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;Zurich to Doha and Doha to Narita on May 29-30. Was traveling with my wie and children (3 and 5). At the check-in we got the information that we can't access the lounge at the new Doha airport. For this reason we got a voucher which could be changed into vouchers at Doha airport. The flight from Zurich to Doha was one hour delayed. We didn't get any proper information. The departure time was shifted every 15 minutes. Once on board was surprised about the comfort in the cabin. The food and drinks were excellent. The service onboard was average. At Doha airport they were not really ready. Very long queue at the security check. Asked for business class fast track. Was not available. Then had to walk quite a long way for the connecting gate. We were flying from gate B1A. That meant we had to take a bus to the plane but first we had to wait outside for the bus. Once at the plane we had to wait outside again before we could enter. Flight was ok. Food again excellent and the service was better than from Zurich to Doha.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;BUD-DOH-SGN on 28-29 May 2014. Aircraft's A321 and A330-200 respectively. All flights on time. No queues in any counters as there were plenty open. Ground staff in BUD were extremely attentive and co-operative and assisted me fully dealing with a luggage problem (my luggage only arrived to Hungary when I was due to depart after a weeks stay). WiFi not available. What was stunning was their excellent co-operation on this with the competing carrier TK. I was from BUD without demands upgraded from the cheapest possible economy ticket to business class to DOH. The cabin was almost full (10 seats of 12 taken) but service was top-notch despite I was initially not expected to be in the business class. Champagne has changed from Jackquart to Lanson. Food very good. Seats not lie flat but no much need to lie down on a day flight? Doha Hamad Airport is still in its infantry but service desks are all over the place to make up for faults. Arrived to be taken to the gates by the busses which was a first disappointment. The lounges are not fully operating: very few and crowded and short of meat-dishes showers and sparkling wine. WiFi is operating. DOH-SGN: Boarding directly from gate to aircraft ! A huge improvement from the old airport. Upgraded at gate despite aircraft was only 30% full. Champagne choice extended to include the Taittinger rose. Good food. Only 4 seats of 24 were occupied. FAs good though could have been a bit more observant/proactive. But they were all professional and comprehending. A pleasure to lie down on the seats.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;JFK to DWC via DOH. Managed to get first row economy bulkhead seats for self and wife. Found myself sitting next to some sort of bodybuilder guy whose biceps extended over into my space. When they announced all pax on board we swiftly moved over to the centre three seats and took up aisle positions with the centre seat empty. Flight was decent but the IFE was abysmal. Poor choice of movies and entertainment. We were among the first to transit the new airport in Doha - thank goodness no more buses! Marked improvement over the existing airport. At JFK we got 5K miles extra because the Silver lounge was not ready yet but we used our HSBC Premier cards to get into the Oryx lounge. Decent service clean cabins and bathrooms maintained well. Food could do with an improvement and the IFE needs a complete overhaul.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;On 4th May I flew from Melbourne to Manchester via Doha with Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways is affiliated with One World so lounge access is provided at Melbourne Airport by Qantas always a good way to start a long journey. The plane for the first sector was a brand new Boeing 777 and on a full flight I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of room in economy. I am 6ft 3in (189cms) and I could stretch out quite comfortably without touching the seat in front. I was sat in 23K. In flight entertainment was excellent with Premiere release movies and a host of documentaries to help while the hours away (all 14 hrs and 15 minutes for the first sector). Service and inflight catering was excellent with a good choice of food and regular water runs by the cabin crew. Landing in Doha was probably the only negative as the airport was packed and hectic. With a tight transit time of just 60 minutes I was fearing the worst but somehow it all seemed to happen and I made the connection. The second sector of 7hrs and 30 minutes was completed in an Airbus A330 which was notably smaller and older than the Boeing 777. However the service was on par and food and entertainment options again superior. All in all a pleasant experience for what is a gruelling distance to fly. Qatar Airways deserve the recognition and commendations they win on a regular basis. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-06-02;Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers. unfortunately they face ground staff issues at several airports that frustrate during the boarding and deplaning process. The new airport in Doha their primary hub is open but facing considerable growing pains and still relies on buses for many airport transits. Coupled with insufficient lounge space particularly for their premium customers significantly compromises the overall trip experience and turns their new flagship airport in Doha to a frustrating experience that undermines the excellent in-flight service and value for the money in the competitive market of air travel.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-29;25th April QR 905 MEL-DOH. 28th April QR 904 DOH-MEL. Very boring IFE. Food and staff were good. Value also good. Seats were bad and not comfortable at all.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;AUH-DOH-LHR return. 90 minutes delay at DOH waiting for late connections/congestion. Things will improve with the new airport opening 27th May 2014. The pilot did apologize and water was passed around but it was very hot. It is hardly becoming a 5* airline to operate aircraft with defects that impact on passenger comfort. The system did not work for the safety video and a manual demonstration was provided which appeared hurried and rather perfunctory. Missed connections at DOH for myself and others and the horror of the Doha Airport transfer desk. Only the attendants on the first leg welcomed me onboard as a Gold Card holder.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;1st time flying with Qatar. Flights were from Perth to Dusseldorf. The flight was OK food was enjoyable but the list of inflight movies where old and not that many. All announcements where done in both English and Arabic which get annoying especially the videos of the same safety procedures interrupting the in-flight entertainment. All flights were delayed some by over 1 hour which does not help with tight connections. Missed our flight from Berlin to Dusseldorf for which they took over an hour to get us on the next flight which we almost missed again. Lost our luggage as well at least it turned up the next day. Our return flights were also delayed. It may have been cheaper but Singapore Air does it best. Also Doha airport is not great at all.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;As a frequent flier who travels on business on average of once a month I was rather disappointed to note the poor quality of the cabin crew on both legs of my recent Business Class flight onboard Qatar Airways. The crew were indifferent cold and impersonal. There was no initiative shown by the cabin crew no greetings upon boarding or as the meal was served no offer of newspapers or selection of reading materials service was inconsistent with the crew (with the exception of the inflight supervisor) unwilling to engage in conversation. I mentioned being hungry at 11pm for a 8.30pm flight departure and was rudely told the Captain had the seatbelt sign on. Dinner was finally served at 11.45pm. The plate service does not work as between the first pax being served and the last could take as long as an hour!! Too much time spent in the galley and not enough walking the aisle. Food was good but not fantastic. The inflight entertainment offered all the choices to be expected but the navigation was a little ungainly with the mouse like cursor. The seat was similar to other airlines offering a full flat product. Happy to note that Qatar still provided pyjamas and a small overnight bag which many other airlines have discontinued. Overall my disappointment with the cabin service overwhelms what positives I obtained from a good lounge in Doha and efficient check in service.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;London to Doha Boeing 787. Qatar Airways sets the standard for luxury business class with this airplane and it was the best experience I've had in many years. First class lounge at Heathrow Terminal was fantastic fabulous good great wines and nice staff. Onboard the airplane brilliant business class cabin and nice color scheme. I had a single window seats and truly private - better than most airlines first class. Meals served individually table style and food was good with a great selection of wines. Staff very efficient they don't smile much though but are courteous. The in flight entertainment had massive choice of movies and tv programs. Downside was arrival into Doha with long bus ride but the new airport is flagged to open this week and that will top this off as the best business class out there.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;BOS-HKG via Philadelphia and Doha. When we arrived in Philadelphia we needed new boarding passes so went to the Qatar Airways counter for them. The attendant said that there was something wrong with our ticket boarding passes cannot be issued and only US Airways can fix the problem. She sent us to the US Airways counter without telling us what was the issue. We went over stood in line for 45 minutes waited for someone. Of course nothing was wrong. We went back to Qatar Airways for sure the issue had cleared and we were all set to board. We wasted over 90 minutes for no apparent reason. Philadelphia to Doha was delayed severely due to a bathroom issue. Doha Airport itself was small and messy with the new Hamad Airport opening 27 May it will probably get better. HKG-DOH with Cathay Pacific we were upgraded to Premium Economy free due to overbooking. The seat was very comfortable. The in flight entertainment system was more responsive compared to Qatar Airways. DOH-PHL I slept through most of the flight and my husband most of the flight. I don't recommend this airline unless you are flying business or first class where Qatar Airways actually value you.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-26;JNB-DOH-BCN return. All flights on time early into JNB on return home. All flights on newish aircraft comfortable seats and nice meals. Staff on night flight were not present in the cabin as much as I would expect but the rest was nice and attentive. Doha airport was bearable and quite quick connections both ways but can't wait for their new airport to finally open. Didn't use the IFE myself but my partner was impressed and watched endless choice of movies.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-23;NBO-DOH-BUD on 19 May 2014. All flights on time. Check-in was done well - I had two tickets and 4 sectors in front of me – only the first 2 sectors were with Qatar Airways but they managed to issue all 4 boarding cards thus the last two sectors were with Turkish who are in Star-alliance. Also the luggage was checked through beyond Budapest –- a nice touch. First leg on A320 night flight load only 60% - thus offered 3 seats in a row. Nice touch is that they offered 3 options of dinners (instead of breakfast) thus the clock was 2 am. I had red-marinated sea-bass as 1st main-course and as there were plenty of food left as many were sleeping I had rice and chicken as a 2nd main-course. Staff were proactive and I was greeted by name again by at least 4 FAs. Wines in mini-bottles and of reasonable quality. DOH-BUD A321. Flight full except 1 seat next to me. I was greeted and respected as Privilege Club Gold Card holder. Morning flight with 3 options of hot food. I chose the vegetarian omelette. Champagne Jacquart upon request. Juices and coffee ad libitum. I was explained by the chief purser on QRs new booking system which make it possible to combine tickets and transfer luggage across airlines many sectors and different alliances. IFE good though my monitor froze an hour before landing.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-18;CPT-DOH-MXP-DOH-CPT. Big surprise was QR122 MXP-DOH on A320-200 aircraft where the old uncomfortable seat have been replaced with lie-flat ones! Well done Qatar Airways being a six hours night flight it made a difference. DOH-CPT on new Boeing Dreamliner was a good one. Pity a technical glitch kept us on the tarmac in Johannesburg for an extra three hours with little said from the captain. Overall a positive experience with a competent and professional cabin crew.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-17;MUC-CRK-MUC. Flight was very very good. In time good Entertainment system. Only point: I flew at night. I had to wait long until they served dinner and I could get a nap.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-12;I flew on a connection from JFK-FCO-DOH-LHE. The ticket was a combination of Alitalia and Qatar. Excellent flight from JFK with Alitalia very impressed with their new business class. Of course when I arrived in Rome it was the traditional European lounge which was decent for a 3 hour layover. I have been flying Qatar for the past 6 years now. As soon as the flight was announced for boarding I didn't pay attention at that time Qatar airways ground staff came and assisted me to the aircraft with a very friendly attitude. The moment I entered the cabin they knew who I was and escorted me to my seat. The cabin manager then came introduced herself to me and thanked me for being their loyal Qatar Airways member. Throughout the flight the cabin crew were very friendly. 7 hours journey great food great hospitality. Landed at Doha Airport again separate terminals for First and Bus class passengers was treated very well and acknowledged by everyone for my membership status. Took a shower in the lounge and 2 hours later boarded for LHE. Again great service till LHE and enjoyed every minute of my flight. Etihad and Emirates should learn from Qatar Airways. Looking forward to their new Airport soon.;POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2014-05-11;LHR-DOH-BKK-DOH-LHR. On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airways’ policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a ‘VVIP’ which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience – the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the ‘World’s 5-star airline’ but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-11;CDG-DOH-NRT return. Y class. QR deserves its five stars. FAs were always smiling very helpful and some of them truly friendly. Extra drinks I ordered were never forgotten. Food was above average for Y class. IFE is excellent with dozens of films and lots of languages to choose from. But I was most of all impressed by the DOH-NRT flights on B777-200: the planes were brand new seats very comfortable with good legroom the cabin is small and stylish for Y IFE perfect food very tasty from NRT and the crew largely Japanese were fantastic as well as the ground staff at NRT. Without doubt the best Y flight I made in many years. On the downside A340 were ageing organisation of meals was often weird (too short or kept for too long) temperature in the cabin was curiously always badly managed (too hot or too cold) and most of all Doha's airport is awfully crowed and dull. New airport will be a major improvement.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-11;Flew from Doha - Hong Kong via airbus A330. I will definitely try to avoid this aircraft of Qatar the aircraft was an old one based on the looks and the seat was really uncomfortable. I sat on the pillow and blanket just to make it feel better. The inflight entertainment isn't as entertaining as before.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-08;Very good service providing the price. Staff are very helpful and very attentive to any request you put to them. Entertainment was good but kept disconnecting / freezing during the flight but was always fixed. On our connecting flight from Doha to DXB the rear toilets were not in use and the door kept slamming open during the flight. Overall I would use Qatar again considering the price.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-06;HBE-DOH First Class Airbus 320. Usual high quality afforded to me. Food and beverages very good staff attentive. Flight out personal DVD but limited films Flight back Personal TV with usual high selection of movies. Unfortunately on this route as its not popular you tend to get older planes.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-05;We flew last month from SIN-DOH-YUL sectors. It was a very long flight. The check-in at Changi airport was really smooth and the check in staff were really quick and helpful. The inflight meals and service were exceptional. Qatar Airways proves again and again why its a 5-star airline mostly due to their customer service cabin service and exceptional professionalism. The kids really loved the IFE inflight service and the caring staff. The transit at DOH was pretty quick and the next flight to YUL was a long one again. The cabin staff and the inflight service made our long journey a very relaxing one and enjoyable one. Hats off to Qatar airways staff. I would definitely fly Qatar airways again in the future.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-05-05;"We travel LHR-JNB or LHR-CPT regularly usually on Emirates British Airways or South African but this was our first time on Qatar travelling LHR-JNB via Doha. Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed. by 50 minutes on the return leg and by 55 minutes on the outbound 50 of which were spent sitting the tarmac. Doha airport is a mess with a quite long ""luxury"" bus trip from the Arrivals and the Premium Transfer Terminal. The Qatar lounge in the Premium Terminal at Doha is good if rather large and impersonal and Qatar use the Shongolo Lounge at JNB which is pretty good although a little in need of decoration at the far end near the windows. All-in-all Qatar was reasonably good and the flights were 30% cheaper than Emirates BA and SAA but we probably won't be flying with them again.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-29;Hong Kong - Madrid via Doha. Three of the planes were far too hot the food was dire especially the breakfasts each flight was delayed and changing planes in Doha airport is horrendous with incredibly long bus journeys to the terminals and then a madly cramped terminal to deal with. The air hostesses were mixed with two flights being fine but one flight having a very angry hostess. I'm going back to Air China Etihad and Emirates for long haul to Europe.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-28;Flew with my family FRA-DOH then DOH-SIN two days later. We were travelling with our 7 month old baby. Check-in agent in FRA and DOH were both serious and seemed unhappy to have us at their counter. Both did not give any eye contact when they spoke to us. They were very much focused on assigning the seats for us and our baby. Also the food tray for one of our seats was not cleaned and had some food stains on it. But apart from this all else was excellent. They accommodated our 7 pieces of luggage FAs were attentive and were constantly present throughout the flight. Food was fantastic especially on the DOH-SIN leg. I couldn't get enough of their IFE (so much to choose from). Seats were very comfortable and on the FRA-DOH leg they ensured seats around us were free so that we have plenty of room for our baby. Can't say the same for our experience at DOH airport though. But will not comment about that here.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-27;QR 240 IST-DOH and QR 844 DOH-KUL. Again Qatar changed our seats that we booked 4 months before. They separated 6 of us without any reason. Flight was delayed 30 minutes lunch service was very late. Doha airport was busy: they called for boarding went down to the ground floor the bus had still not come we have to wait 30 minutes in a small room with limited seating and without air conditioning. QR 844 use B777-3ER this flight was much better. Still no hot towel in the morning.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-24;Stockholm - Doha - Nairobi - Doha - Stockholm. A very comfortable journey with great service on all flights. The leg between Stockholm and Doha was particularly good in one of the new Dreamliners with champagne being served in economy class to mention one of the many positive things.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-24;KTM-DOH-FRA in March. Business Class. Very bad and unorganized crew on flight KTM-DOH. Took ages to serve a drink. Dinner service started as all passengers in economy had nearly finished. My choice was no longer available. Nearly all passengers upgraded from economy. Still recommend because of the really excellent crew on flight DOH-FRA and the high level of service received here. Angled lie flat seats only not very comfortable. Both flights delayed aircraft change from Dreamliner to old A330.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-23;Phnom Penh - Nice. Service onboard is superb. Fine food great choice of movies and excellent service as a whole although when plane is full service tends to be slow. The problem with Qatar is the transfers in Doha. It is from another age and the new airport which was supposed to be finished by 2012 is not yet in service. Thus you have to climb stairs to get into the plane and have a 20 minute ride on the tarmac before getting to the lounge areas. Still one of the best flying experience of my life. Will fly again with them when they have their new airport ready.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-21;QR905 MEL-DOH QR259 DOH-WAW QR184 VIE-DOH QR904 DOH-MEL. Flights between Doha and Warsaw and Vienna and Doha were good completely opposite to the longer haul. Midnight flight out of MEL thought I would be able to sleep for the first part - wrong. Hot meal served about 1.5 hrs into flight sometime before cabin lights turned off. Cabin crew don't insist on seats upright at meal times so bit squashed if person in front has seat fully reclined and meals not as good as shorter flights. No foot rests so legs soon started aching 1am flight out of DOH on return sleeping when meal came so didn't get any drinks/meal until 2 hrs before landing in MEL. Toilets only two per section not cleaned often enough one was out of all paper products long queues.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-19;SGN-DOH-NBO on 17-18 April 2014. Airbus 330 and 320 respectively. Check-in in Saigon polite but the staff (outsourced by QR to local company) at check-in was very inexperienced and pedantic and insisted on seeing onwards tickets visa etc so it took me 15 minutes at the counter. Flights punctual and service on top. All my personal preferences (seating food drinks) were accommodated. From Saigon I got an excellent dinner including 3 alternative options offered. I had a fish meal of very high class. Wines served from large bottles and several choices including champagne. IFE worked well. I was offered an upgrade to business class for 700 USD which I eventually declined though tempted. The dreadful bus-shuttling at Doha airport takes some credit away from my score for overall rating. Lounge access (gold card) smooth. DOH-NBO a bit more modest on-board service but still 3 options for dinner. Luggage arrived smoothly.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-16;"CDG-DOH-DWC flown April 16th. CDG-DOH was overall a good flight however check-in at CDG was very chaotic and police control was a mess. Other big black point: the ""Icare"" lounge at CDG 1 with no showers nor private toilets. Equipment was an A340-600 which was pretty dirty. A real shame. The saving grace was the good service on-board. For a change transfer at DOH was a breeze and Oryx Lounge was really appreciable. DOH-DWC: messy flight with rude and unprofessional Moroccan hostesses only Chef de Cabine did her best. DWC Al Maktoum airport seems to be a big joke.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-16;DOH to LHR 11th April 2014. Departure delayed 90 mins due to a passenger becoming sick and being taken off. Same thing happened on LHR to DOH leg on 3rd April. Both times communication poor. DOH to LHR leg staff abrupt lunch service didn't start until 4.30pm (2.5 hours into flight) and was slow. I was bypassed both at drinks service and lunch and had to ask for drinks and my meal. There was no duty free service. The cabin crew seemed very inexperienced and flustered towards the end of the flight. All in all very poor.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-15;Flew FRA to Singapore via Doha. First leg FRA-DOH was not pleasant packed with uncomfortable seats. DOH-SIN got better as they transferred me to a bulkhead seat. Return was not bad. Major issue seems to be Doha airport both inbound flights were late arriving and transfer takes an age leaving you running to the gate to get the connection. Another frustration is lack of options when trying to pick your seat on-line in advance. Next time I would probably go back to Emirates-Dubai.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-14;Flew CAI-DXB via DOH. First leg was a tired old A330-200 that has clearly seen better days. PTV is older- generation and is not touch-screen. The control buttons were built into the armest making it very difficult to use them. System was very slow and kept crashing. In the end I could not watch a movie. Dinner was a choice of chicken or fish and not bad at all. Drinks were a selection of soft drinks juices and alcoholic drinks. Service was very good. Crew were friendly and dedicated assisting passengers with young children. The second leg DOH-DXB was operated by an A320. Service was very rushed (usual chicken or veggie wrap and water or juice) but on the shorter legs no one cares. Overall a good experience despite the old A330-200s which should get refitted as soon as possible. QR offers a 40kg baggage allowance ex Cairo and a choice of up to three departures from Cairo making them a convenient and reliable airline.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-14;QR 650 on 7 April Doha - KTM. Kathmandu- Doha- Colombo and return. We a family of 4 2 adults and 2 kids do at least 4 international return trips a year - including 2 business class long haul flights. I have flown Qatar business class once but after this last flight our preferred airline is going to stay Thai - both for the better airport quality and the much better quality and service onboard and on the ground. Qatar flights were late both to and from Kathmandu our baggage did not connect on the outbound and ground staff in Doha claimed our almost empty hand luggage to be too big. I noticed the overhead bins on the flight were pretty empty.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-13;LHR-PVG via Doha and then PEK-LHR via Doha again. These flights were the cheapest on the market when I purchased them in January and having had my first experience with Qatar last year I was delighted to book these flights for £450. 3 of the flights were on the B777 with the fourth being on the B787 Dreamliner. I had a window seat for all flights but would not book another window seat on the Dreamliner - there is a metal box just where your leg closest to the window should be! I was lucky in that I was sitting next to a waif of a girl who only required about 1cm of leg space so I was able to stretch my legs into her space. Service was good and food was adequate. I'm of the opinion that I get on an aeroplane to fly to a destination rather than for an extraordinary gastronomic experience and these flights did little to change that opinion. Inflight entertainment offering was good though my system did not work between London and Doha and the person sitting next to me on a later flight also suffered the same problem. In both instances the stewardesses seemed disinterested.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-13;The outbound leg from LHR T4 to Doha was on a very old plane (still had cigarette disposal units). My partners' TV screen did not work. Although my screen did work the control panel was permanently embedded in the arm rest - not only did this make it highly awkward to use but the buttons were not programmed to correlate to the places displayed on screen. On the return leg from Doha to LHR the plane was just as bad - plus there were no bags containing earplugs and eye masks left for passengers! The PA system was not working well and kept deafening the passengers with feedback. To top this off there were only 2 loos available for what must have been around 200 economy passengers. I would never choose to fly Qatar again.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-08;Economy - LHR to Melbourne. Boeing 777-200/300. Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock. Oryx entertainment system also excellent although the TV shows lacked variety. For my regular trips home to Aus I'm now to looking to Qatar first.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-07;Flew LHR-SIN via Doha. Flown many times on Qatar always in J class. B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection. Great fares and now Oneworld membership make it a no brainer for me and my family.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-06;I flew with my family from Washington Dulles to Perth Australia. The aircraft was clean comfortable seats. When we got to Doha it was a 7 hour layover in a crowded airport and we were delayed by an hour because one passenger didn't show up however staff on the flight to Perth were helpful good food once again and good service and legroom on the plane. Will definitely use it again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-03;Perth to London via Doha. Perth to Doha Boeing 777 had reasonable legroom. Service adequate meal selection poor. Doha - London Boeing 787 restricted legroom with impediment under seat in front. Again meals not great but good service. Both legs on time. Had to change flight 10 days before departing Perth at great cost.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-02;Geneva-Doha Doha KL on 29th/30th Jan 2014. Embarkation at Geneva was smooth and efficient. The flight attendants were most attentive and the food excellent. Arriving at Doha and going to the Premium Transfer complex is a breeze. Food seating capacity showers it is all there and certainly a notch over most other airlines' premium facilities I would say. Had a few hours to spend in the Premium facility and time passed quickly. The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons). I don't understand why the seats are angled in the Airbus but not on the 777? I hope to fly again with Qatar but on their Boeing 777 rather than on their Airbuses.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-02;CRK-DOH-CPH on March 22-23. A330 and B787. Clean Planes and fine service onboard especially from Clark. And plenty off room at B787 from Doha to CPH even in the middle row. The Airport In Doha is not the best all the bus driving to and from the planes is annoying.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-04-01;LHR-DOH-COK. While the outbound flights were comfortable with clean planes and reasonable service our return flights were terrible. It all seems to depend on how busy business class. From the start checking in at Cochi airport took such a long time since the person at the desk seemed to have a difficult time checking in our bags through the London. As always the business lounge in Doha was packed. The main problem was on our morning flight from Doha to London. When breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. They were a choose of pancakes or waffles. Basically not much of a choice. When I asked if I could get more fruit or muesli I was told 'No'. The snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. Overall the in-flight service was terrible. Their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if I wanted a special meal I should have requested one. I would not recommend flying them in any class given their poor in-flight and customer service.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-31;AMM-DOH-AMM in economy both ways on 777 ER 300. Plane in excellent condition very clean and seats extremely comfortable with plenty of leg room for a big guy like me (I am 6 ft 2). Inflight entertainment excellent with plenty of choice. The only real let down is the food which was terrible both ways and overwhelmed staff who did the bare minimum. The buses to the plane in Doha are a nightmare and it took over an hour to board the full 777 which resulted in a minor delay. The new Hamad airport should solve this pretty soon. The price was cheap I would definitely use them again in economy especially in long haul since the comfort they offer beats out Emirates or Etihad any day. European carriers business class is worse than QR economy.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-30;Singapore to London (via Doha) Economy on 21-22 March 2013. QR 939 (77W) and QR 009 (A346). Boarding was a bit slow at Singapore Changi Airport but once on board seats were wider than most airlines and plenty of legroom! Staff were extremely professional towels and sweets handed out before take off meals promptly served upon departure cabin crew brought drinks regularly to customers etc. Touch screen IFE on the 77W was excellent though not as many choices as their Mid-East competitor Emirates. Smooth landing in Doha before midnight. Connected to QR 009 four hours later onto a A346 - service was once again excellent with regular drinks services and meals served promptly. The IFEs on the A346 were older but choices of movies the same as the 77W. Seats were once again comfortable but this time there was less legroom and seat width. Landed in London on time and bags on the belt within half an hour. Extremely pleased with the service and excellent value for money.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-30;Paris CDG to Singapore (via Doha) Economy on QR 38 (A346) and QR 938 (B77L). Boarding was fast at CDG and flight left on time. Service on this flight was excellent - crew brought drinks regularly meals were served as soon as flight departed Paris and snack was give before landing at Doha and always a smile on the faces of the crew as they went around the cabin. There was leg space and seat width on the A346 but luckily for me the flight was not full and I had a whole row to myself. IFEs were older but nevertheless selection of movies were good. Extremely smooth landing at Doha before scheduled arrival time transfer to the terminal took about 10 minutes but once inside was able to connect to my next flight to Singapore with time to spare (I had a 1 hour 25 minute transit). QR 938 to Singapore on newer B77L flight was even emptier than the last so another row to myself as well. Seats wider on this aircraft with lots of legroom. Service was excellent once again towels and sweets passed around drinks came regularly breakfast served after takeoff and snack served before arrival in Singapore. Flight landed ahead of time. I would certainly recommend Qatar Airways and look forward to flying them again on my next trip - the airline is really going places especially with the new Hamad Airport set to open its doors within the next year or so.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-30;NBO-DOH-SGN on 29 March. Airbus 320 (3x3 seat configuration) and 330 (2x4x2 seat configuration) respectively. Aircraft's neat and in good condition. Flights on time. Announcements were good. Staff attending and try their best though rarely suggest outside the box. Priority members highly respected recognized and acknowledged. FAs hardworking and attentive call buttons answered quickly. IFE good but not of my priority. Night-flights after midnight serve no dinner in economy very annoying for me. No beer options only a trivial Heineken is offered. What a pity as the world have so much better options to offer. Doha airport still a nightmare packed and imprisoned in busses without information or reasoning. A 2-days delayed bag from my previous trip was not compensated.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-29;Melbourne to London via Doha. Late leaving Melbourne by 2 hours we missed the connection at Doha. Waiting at Doha airport gave me time to check the departure boards and every single plane was late departing. At times there were nine planes waiting to takeoff. We boarded our plane on time but then waited 70 minutes before it took off. It was a tired old A330 clean but hopeless AV system with controls fastened to the side of the seats which were difficult to operate. Immigration at LHR was prompt but we waited for more than an hour for our bags! Doha Airport just cannot handle the increased number of flights as Qatar Airways increases the number of flights. This can only get worse until they get a second runway.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-28;NRT-DOH-BUD Tokyo to Doha was on a 772LR. The service was excellent with choices ranging from Japanese dishes to westerner quite nice selection of wines as well. Inflight entertainment was good with plenty of movies to chose from. Even though the seat wasn't a fully flat bed I had a good sleep and woke up rested before landing to Doha. The next leg to Budapest was on a 321 not bad but you can't compare it with the business class from the wide- bodied aircraft's. Overall I would recommend flying Qatar Airways I had a good experience.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-28;FRA-DOH-DXB-DOH-FRA. First 2 and last leg on 788 DXB to DOH leg on A320. Overall good experience 788 is a great plane clean toilets nice seats good IFE. Excellent wine selection which you often only find in First Class of other carriers. Food was poor no taste and little selection. That was better when I last took them. Staff were great on all flights and hopefully the transfer in DOH will one day be without busses. However: Staff in Frankfurt on check in as well as in DXB (both contracted) were unfriendly not interested in helping and the look and feel of the check in area was in both cases shabby.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-27;Travelled from Manchester to Melbourne in December. First time travelling with Qatar Airways was not disappointed. Our seats were very comfortable and the service was first class. Looking forward to our next trip with Qatar.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-26;Montreal Canada to Phnom Penh Cambodia. The service was more than I expected helpful crew. I had time to visit Doha at night during my transit. From Doha to Phnom Penh the flight was also agreeable but I was disappointed that no message was made for boarding. One hour before departure I started seeing people getting in line to embark. I waited until the last moment and mentioned to the Qatar staff that I didn't hear any announcement for boarding was that common practice? The staff member replied that they usually made an official announcement but this time they had not Besides that I really enjoyed flying Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-24;We flew from CDG via DOH to JNB and couldn't have been happier! Food and service excellent. Very clean toilets. We didn't use the inflight entertainment and therefore can't comment. Bus ride from plane to terminal seemed to take forever. Premium Terminal hopelessly overcrowded when we got there without a single table for 2 in sight. Fortunately we didn't have a long transfer time on our way back to CDG and could almost board immediately. We will definitely continue to take Qatar Airways for all of our long distance flights even if it means changing planes in Doha instead of going direct. Not only is Business Class so much more affordable than other European airlines but it is simply so much better as well! Keep up the great service!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-21;07/03/14 Manchester-Doha QR024. 08/03/14 Doha-Singapore QR944. 15/03/14 Singapore-Doha QR945 Doha- Manchester QR023. Agree with review left by S Lloyd. Doha transit not good. Bus to terminal - poor facilities in airport (went to Oryx lounge in the hope of a shower but advised 1.5 hr wait for towels). In-flight entertainment poor. Food awful. Been going to S'pore for many years I have used other airlines/routes which have given a better service.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-13;QR24 and QR940 18/19 Feb 2014 and return QR939 and QR21 on 1/2 March 2014. Recently flew Manchester-Doha- Singapore and was dissatisfied with the whole service. Flights outward and return were delayed. In Doha we were left in a holding area with approximately 100 other passengers with no ventilation air con or access to water in high temperatures with seats for only a dozen people whilst was waited for the nonsense of being bussed to our next flight. This happened on both the outward and return flights. Onboard staff were unfriendly and everything seemed too much trouble. Food was mediocre at best and repetitive. The entertainment system is outdated. I cannot recommend.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-11;DXB-DOH-BCN March 5th. Overall a not-too-bad flight experience but QR staff really showed disorganization and even lack of interest. DXB-DOH flight was a breeze. Transfer at Doha airport is obviously the same chaos Silver Privilege Club Lounge is quite grotty. DOH-BCN: A332 equipment totally disorganized cabin crew. Food was fair just fair. IFE very poor and repetitive. Arrival on-time at BCN airport baggage were delivered very quickly with PC priority respected. At least a fair value for money.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-10;Flew for the first time with Qatar (CDG-DOH-MLE) and to be honest - I'm slightly disappointed. May be also my expectations were too high. Meals and wine cart are really very good. But the service is very slow. It's a real problem on the evening flight from Paris - it took almost 2 hours to have a dinner which is long as result - not much time to sleep. Seats are quit comfortable on A340 but not exceptional not comfortable at all on A321 (but it looks they will be replaced now). Transfer by buses in Doha is not an issue and Premium terminal is very big and provides a lot of place and different drinks and meals. What is strange: they don't serve champagne before take off in Paris but they do in Doha and in Male.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-10;24/02 DOH-DPS on QR 944. The airline provides a high level of service with a superb wine list and meal menus. The seat on the B777 is great better for me than the new 787 one as I never travel alone and always wanted a window seat. Crew were excellent except on the short SIN-DPS. Premium terminal at Doha is fine but crowded and without enough facilities.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-05;I have traveled many times with Qatar Airways I am never disappointed and I feel their service is getting better. The last flights I had was from JKT-DOH DOH-ANK IST-DOH DOH-JKT. All staff were polite friendly responsive and helpful. For economy class the seats have more space than EK or EY. The only complaint is transferring at Doha was not as convenient as transferring in Abu Dhabi or Dubai.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-05;Travelled with Qatar 6 times now first 4 or so were great and was left impressed. The last few flights have seen a decrease in service. Having said that seats are comfortable in-flight entertainment is pretty good food is ok but doesn't seem to change often (if at all) and flight attendants really do depend - have had really great ones and have had rude ones. I find the service a big part of the overall rating. Would fly again but not before looking around.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-03-03;LHR to DOH en-route to Perth. This plane seemed very new it had a good touchscreen TV and a little tablet in the seat. Good movie options clear screen and sound. Seats were comfortable and roomy I also had 2 seats to myself which helped. Service was good the food was ok offered plenty and had some lovely bruschetta in-between meals. Boarded a different plane from DOH to PER this was definitely an older plane. I was in an aisle seat and it was the most uncomfortable plane I've been on. Staff never smiled and when you asked for a drink they seemed annoyed. The food wasn't that good. On the return I had an 11 hour PER to DOH and this only bearable because I luckily had a row to myself so lay down and slept. Again staff never smiled and there was only one girl who was friendly. On the next 7 hour flight to LHR I was absolutely freezing! So much so I had to ask for a 2nd blanket.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-25;LHR-CPT (via Doha). LHR lounge is phenomenal. Attentive service great food modern relaxing layout. Onboard seats great service lower than usual. Very sad to see the menus have still not changed in a year. It is sad to see levels in my favourite airline dropping. No value for money. I'm looking forward to see what my return flight has in store including a visit to the dreaded bidvest lounge in Cape Town which makes a wait in the terminal more pleasant than visiting the 'exclusive' lounge. Flagship premium terminal service and offering appalling. Will switch to another larger gulf carrier from now on despite frequent flyer status.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-24;Warsaw - Doha - Bangkok: Our first flight was really good  the seat was very comfort and there was plenty of legs space . I'm very happy with this flight and nothing more to add  there was good foods friendly staff and a USB charger. Bangkok - Doha - Warsaw: Boeing 777 the plane was really old and my seat had a broken audio. We tested with 3 headphones and none worked so I had to sit for 7 hours watching the screen without any sound. One of the staff was rude we called her several of times and she ignored us and walked away.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-21;London - Cape Town via Doha and Jo'burg on 6th Feb returning on 18th Feb. Outward flight from Doha delayed (awaiting connecting passengers) which meant I missed my connection in Jo'burg. This was on South African but booked as through ticket with Qatar. No-one from Qatar to assist on arrival. SA would not rebook. Had to search airport for Qatar desk (which was in international departures miles away (and well hidden). This was highly stressful after 2 flights. Return trip flight one hour late into Doha. Efficient transit meant I caught the London flight but again one hour late. It seems that the transit for many passengers is leading increasingly to delays. Inflight service ok. 777 comfortable - 340 less so and poorer AVOD. Choice of films etc was excellent. Food tolerable but had the same chicken wrap 3 times and breakfast orange squash described as orange juice was disgusting. 3 flights out of 4 were an hour late. I would probably try to fly direct next time.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-20;2/14 QR192 BRU-DOH. 2/15 QR806 DOH-NRT. BRU-DOH 787: Great seat and IFE. Good food and service. DOH Airport: Buses lines slow and bad communication. DOH-NRT 777: Feels old. Seat not bad. IFE cumbersome to work. Service and food good. NRT Airport: bus ride to terminal almost as long as the flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-19;Flew LHR-CMB on 11 Feb 14 (via DOH). First Sector was on an A332. Aisle seat and IFE box was in the way but for a short leg wasn't too bad. Breakfast wasn't great. Second sector on an A320. IFE was from shared drop-down screens. Dinner was ok. Crew excellent as usual on both of these sectors. Return sectors with a long layover at DOH (I left the airport to visit the city). CMB-DOH 17 Feb 2014 was on a B777 excellent leg room but IFE screen kept freezing and restarting of its own accord. Once again Breakfast wasn't great. 18 Feb 14 DOH-LHR on the Dreamliner the reason I chose this carrier. Seat was comfortable and IFE seemed to have more choice. Crew excellent as they always are.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-18;QR817 27/1/2014. Food during flight very good while service was average as well as comfort of the seats. There is no where to store your glasses while you are sleeping. Drinks come only on request. Qatar Airways is not willing to transfer your baggage to another airlines. You have to pay extra or go through immigration to collect it and check in new. The infotainment is not that great. If the flight is cheap go for it.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-17;On my third return trip from Melbourne to Munich via Doha (777 MEL to Doha and 787 Dreamliner to MUC) over the last two years I found the airline to be still offering a high level of service and comfort to its passengers. The standards are high and Business Class on the Dreamliner is something special. The Business Lounge facilities at Doha are also a highlight. Would recommend this airline to anyone contemplating a trip to Europe in the future.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-15;I and my wife were on flight London-Doha-Bangkok economy Jan 8th and return Feb 7th. The flight service food etc. were good but we expected more space between seats. For a long haul flight it is inconvenient to have the seat in front of you almost in your arms and sitting in the window seat causes a lot of disturbances when trying to move from the seat. The ticket price was fair and we arrived on time.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-14;LHR-DOH-CMB 31 Jan. 777-3 on both sectors has a superbly spacious and comfortable lay-out. LHR-DOH was 1 hour late giving more time to enjoy great lounge but arrived DOH 15mins early and was the best J class flight I've ever had. Catering was superb but it seems you had to ask for afternoon tea service. DOH transfer was fine: yes the coach is slow but you're sitting comfortably and you get a view of the action of a busy airport. DOH-CMB also left late but there were no apologies or reasons from captain and no attempt to make up time en route.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-14;CMB-DOH-LHR 12 Feb. Excellent 777-3 first sector then less good less spacious not horizontal seat but acceptable A330-3. Both sectors left and arrived late without reasons or apologies from captain which is slack. Breakfast on 1st sector could have been better and more substantial as most pax would have had very early start to get flight and lounge at CMB didn't offer much. Boarding at CMB is hectic but J class pax were told to push their way to the front! Would be better if they called you from lounge after the melee had died down. Short transfer was fine at a quiet mid day DOH. LHR sector crew very nice but service procedures could be improved - they needed reminding to serve my partner and I together so we could eat at same time. Angled lie flat seat was OK for daylight flight. You had to ask for fast track immigration invitation. J class bags came last at LHR not QR's fault.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-13;QR219 4th Jan. Having been a Privilege club member for 10 years I have seen the standards of service and quality of catering markedly decline. I flew Sofia-Doha last week. Having identified myself to cabin crew as a club member instead of being given an early choice of menu items I was told when they served dinner that my first choice was finished. However they somehow rustled up my first choice unfortunately it was inedible. Wine which used to be served in proper half bottles is now dispensed in plastic cups my request for a second glass was granted rather grudgingly.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-12;Flew on 12th Jan on Doha - Bangalore sector. Affairs at Doha airport are not as exquisite. Check in area is dull. No airbridges means we had to shuttle in a bus for flight that was to take off right on time. Saw Dreamliner marking near tail and had mixed feelings of excitement and fear. 10 min into seating and pilot announced some technical snag. 10 more minutes and he announced that the wind shield had cracked and we that the plane can't take off. Surprisingly QR managed to arrange alternate plane of exact make sat us comfortably and took off in an hour. Food and IFE were perfect for 4 hrs long flight. I did not miss my connection from Bangalore. Wanted to shop for a few things in-flight but unfortunately they had run out of stock. We fly for safe and on time travel. QR managed to satisfy that need in-spite of the glitch.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-11;On 2 legs of a 4 leg trip the airline did not have enough food choices to accommodate business class passengers which is unacceptable. On one leg (Doha to London) several women who were seated in business class but had children in economy class - these children were allowed to repeatedly run through business class cabin disturbing other passengers. These passengers also repeatedly ignored safety instructions viz seatbelt signs and mobile phone regulations. Overall flights were on time and otherwise comfortable. We would also comment that the boarding arrangements at Colombo were complete chaos with no separate boarding for premium passengers - a total free for all. Finally on one leg (London to Doha) my wife's inflight entertainment had no sound.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-11;Flew VCE-DOH-CMB and TBS-GYD-DOH-ORD. Friendly and extremely helpful crew great entertainment and affordable price. I've flown them four times already and would recommend.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-07;Flew Business class from Nairobi - Doha- Manchester this week and were very disappointed with lack of facilities at Nairobi. A recent fire meant there was no longer a lounge facility available but as premium passengers we were not offered anything in recompense. Even a voucher to enable us to get some food and drinks at the two upstairs cafes would have helped but on enquiry we were told that business class passengers were to get nothing just as the economy passengers. Thankfully the flight in an airbus A320 was comfortable and we were well looked after and the same could be said of the Doha - Manchester sector.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-07;CPH-DOH-SGN and back 4 flights in total. Good product consistency. Crew helpful and reacting quickly on all call bells by passengers within 1-2 minutes maximum. Bar and food service great. One could though wish there were more after dinner liqueurs apart from just brandy. Rest of bar service is very good with choice of 2 red and 2 white wines of good quality even free (and real) champagne in Economy impressive! CPH-DOH-CPH 787 Dreamliner seats narrow. DOH-SGN-DOH A330 and more comfortable. Bathrooms kept tidy at all times with lotion and eau de toilette. Current airport in DOH is a nightmare and destroys the whole superb inflight experience. All in all excellent!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-04;BKK-DOH-BKK in Business Class January 2014. First leg was on the 777-300ER and was fine with very friendly and attentive staff. However staff had no idea about where we should go when we landed and I insisted that they were wrong about where they were sending us as we were having a one night layover. However staff insisted that we take the bus and get off at the Premium Lounge. This was of course wrong and we had to wait for a new bus to take us to immigration. Several movies were not showing on the plane but still it was ok. Personally I do prefer Emirates as they seem to have better entertainment onboard and better service. I only used Qatar cause they had joined Oneworld Alliance.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-03;MAN-DOA-MEL return. I wouldn't fly with anyone else now. First long haul flight on my own and I thought it was fantastic. Thought the aircraft's the staff and the service were great. Looking forward to flying again with them.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-02-03;Flew OSL-DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH-ARN with Qatar. New 788s from Oslo and to Stockholm. DOH-ADD and DAR-DOH A320s. Very friendly and attentive service from dominantly Eastern European and Subcontinental crews. 1-2-1 configuration in 788 business class very nice indeed and A320 business class quite comfortable too (even though not good for sleeping). Some inconsistencies in service on some flights my oneworld Emerald status was acknowledged on some not. A very annoying aspect of Qatar service is that the oneworld Emerald status does not give you access to First class facilities and you don’t get First class labelling to your luggage. This is different from other oneworld carriers with First class (at least British Airways Cathay Pacific and Qantas) and puts Qatar in an inferior position. The IFE was quite impressive (also on A320s) but did not match the latest IFE on Cathay 77Ws. Qatar provides top notch quality but I would say that Cathay is par at food and beverages but still slightly better in service and much better in attention to details. Cathay’s First class lounges are very nice too its difficult to provide a comparison as I was not admitted to the Qatari facility. In summary I probably will consider Qatar to destinations in East and West Africa and the Middle East but necessarily to South East Asia as changing planes in Doha late in the evening is a nuisance when compared to flying the long Europe – Asia leg non-stop after having enjoyed BA/CX First class hospitality while waiting for the flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-28;MAN-DOH-SIN return. All flights arrived on time but very poor boarding arrangements in DOH and SIN and mixed aircraft experience marred the trip! A330 is quiet and fairly spacious but was showing serious signs of age B777 was a much better flying experience with much more space and comfort and the B787 was a big let down. Despite the good mood lighting and darkened windows on the B787 the manufacturers seem to have used such flimsy and lightweight components that it just doesn't seem as if it is going to last. Plastic panels in three toilets were split as were two panels around the cabin window toilet seat broken in one sink blocked in two seats flex and creek and aisle is way too narrow. The cabin service was good and consistent throughout the food quality was mixed (as usual) champagne on flights from UK is a nice touch and decent wine served throughout remaining flights. However all of the above comments pale into insignificance compared to the loathsome experience of Doha airport. it is truly awful. And no one from QR can say when this sorry airport state will end.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-28;Bangkok to Manchester UK 17 January: delayed in BKK for 5 hours which meant I missed my connection in Doha. finally arrived 8 hours late after a second flight from London. No staff on duty when we should have checked in which was strange we had to wait ages to get re routed and were offered a meal voucher for a restaurant which wasn't open!;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-28;Manchester to Doha and then Bangkok 24th January. First time on a 787 Dreamliner (Manchester to Doha) great plane very quiet and plenty of seat room. Felt very relaxed. A much better plane than the old Airbus which I hope has now been replaced on this sector. Unfortunately the 777 from Doha to BKK is now a let down not much seat room and uncomfortable.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-28;I booked a week before travelling to Dhaka via Doha and due to equipment needed for my project the cheapest way to travel was 1st class.In addition this was where Qatar Airways stands out is the short time between flights this was 3 hours whereas BA and Turkish was a lot longer. My experiences at Heathrow T4 were very pleasant check in was easy and the lounge was not far after security. The lounge itself was very pleasant and the level of service excellent. The range of refreshments and services cannot be praised highly enough. The airline had a cart at the lounge to drive passengers to the gate - a very nice touch. The inflight experience was great. I decided to miss dinner and it was great to just lay on a comfortable flat bed and catch a good few hours sleep. I flicked through the inflight entertainment and was not too impressed by the range of media although if I was not as frequent a traveller then the entertainment on offer would have been fine. On arriving at Doha nice to be taken to the transit area in a BMW. I was only in Doha for 3 hours but again the lounge was very pleasant and relaxing. The flight to Dhaka was in Business Class but very good all the same. The only poor aspect was the wait for baggage in Dhaka but then that's not really Qatar's fault. I would certainly fly with Qatar in future.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-28;Flew B787 from LHR to Doha in economy Check-in and boarding all went as normal but on board I was disappointed that valuable foot-well space is taken up with a metal box containing seat components. Engines not as quiet as I had hoped but chicken curry was delicious such a shame I had to eat it with plastic cutlery! Choice of entertainment on board for a western male was also disappointing far less than on equivalent Emirates flight. The flight was on-time and the cabin crew were polite and helpful. However the flight lands in Doha possibly the worlds biggest shambles of an airport.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-23;November 2013 YUL-DOH-DPS via SIN. Business Class. This business class service and cabin are almost a first class service. Once in Doha the staff were very helpful. Because our flight was changed we were invited to the First Class lounge. They provided us a room and were allowed to use all the First Class lounge facilities during our transit to Bali. The only thing that has to be pointed out is the Singapore 1.30 stop. Very annoying.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-23;SGN-DOH-NBO. Solid product. A-330. New aircraft. Flights on time. Food standards tend to slip a bit further and likewise the wines that are now cheaper and for instance not served in mini-bottles anymore. Entertainment fine. Staff good and focused on work. Doha airport still a nightmare and one waste 1-2 hours of being shipped in busses far far from terminals. DOH-NBO on Airbus 320. Aircraft new clean seat of OK space. Flight full but service and FAs created a good atmosphere much more than OK. Would have preferred proper lunch instead of breakfast on a flight from 9am-2pm. Food and wine standards have dropped a bit but still at 4-star level. IFE very good. A suitcase went missing at arrival in NBO but not only to blame QR as other airlines were involved before Saigon and obviously could only manage to get the luggage to DOH. It was brought 1 day later in elegant wrapping and upon proper notification.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-22;I used Qatar for the first time in January 2013 from LHR-DOH-DAC-DOH-LHR. Everything went smoothly and I have booked again with them for my 2014 holiday.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-22;"Bought two return tickets Cape Town - Milan - in Business Class. After flying Emirates for the past 5 years always as a Gold member Qatar was overall a very positive experience on fights QR1366 CPT-DOH QR119 DOH-MXP. On my way back flight QR122 A320-100/200 MXP-DOH has 12 seats ""business class"" which is not even a super economy: no space no privacy impossible to have some rest. Cannot understand why Qatar uses such a small aircraft overnight! QR1365 DOH-CPT was a very nice experience.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-22;16 January MUC-DOH B787 check in swift smooth and friendly boarding on time. Seat pitch a little bit cramped cabin clean and spacious. Inflight entertainment excellent and earphones given in advance. Food and beverage excellent and a lot of fluid offered throughout the flight. Only downside is the arrival with the long bus service. Arrival on time.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-22;DOH-KUL onboard B777. Transit in the unfinished Doha terminal. 2 hours layover not recommend for longer transit in the current airport. Boarding smooth but take 15-20 minutes to bus to the plane. Was trapped inside the bus for sometime very stuffy. The Oneworld flagship aircraft is very generous with sit pitch sufficient amenity kit headphone waiting in the seat pocket. Excellent in flight entertainment and sound system flawless catering and the snack was awesome. Would like to see a cabin crew with a warm smile but the cabin crew serving my area has done a satisfactory performance. Full flight and would take this airline for another time definitely.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-21;MAD-DOH. I have to say that everything from the start up to the end is perfect. Check-in agent very nice. Madrid lounge is IB which is very nice full breakfast if you want and magazines newspapers drinks and wifi on board. Well trained crew perfect service always with a smile. Great lunch selection of wines and also afternoon tea before arrival. Always recommended.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-20;"LHR-DOH-PER on 27 December and back on 13 January. Dreamliner is brilliant. 777 on the DOH-PER leg not quite as comfortable - the seats are not actually 100% flat. The leg section sags which makes it hard to sleep completely comfortably. Service food and IFE impeccable. WiFi now allowed on the LHR-DOH Dreamliner and this is NOT a good idea. The person behind me was constantly receiving messages and didn't bother to turn his ringtone down. The usual bugbear of a ""scenic drive"" round Doha airport on the outward leg meant only 10 minutes in the (excellent) Premium Terminal. On the return leg both stands were near the Terminal but terminal time was reduced by being sent to the gate 40 minutes before boarding started.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-20;Flew QR 901 PER-DOH QR 721 DOH-ORD and on the way back QR 010 LHR-DOH and QR900 DOH-PER earlier this month. Needed very quick tickets to attend a funeral in the US…and Qatar was one of the few that had seats and an almost reasonable price. That said pretty impressed with the airline. Seats had good legroom - one minor issue was the lack of adequate padding - my whole family grumbled about it considering the many hours we were on their flights. We were all a little saddle-sore at the end of the long flights - and we were using the blankets as extra padding. Aircraft's were of course newish 777's with the exception of an A340 out of LHR…IFE was great… wide variety - razor-sharp seat-back screens - we particularly liked their selection of international movies. I'm diabetic and the meals they supplied were fine the rest of the family very happy with their meals as well. No complaints good tucker. Cabin crews varied from outstanding to good. On our last leg back to Perth staff did their job well - if not particularly happily. I did notice they didn't run up and down the aisles with drinks every hour - but given half (or more) of the cabin was usually asleep - I can see why. They were very quick to hand over juice or water whenever requested. Doha terminal is a definite let-down - the bus trips to and from the terminal are dreadful in this day and age. Inside the terminal is very ordinary. New terminal on the way promises to be much better. Would fly them again for sure.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-17;Third time in Business Class from Germany via Doha to KUL. This time I used the B787 from FRA to DOH which was a great experience. Nice and cosy cabin environment which large monitors delivering a sharp picture. All seats in business class have direct access to the aisles. Service and food as good as always. Looking forward to my next trip with QR hopefully the new airport in DOH will be ready then as the long bus rides at old airport are somehow annoying.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-14;MUC-DOH-BKK-DOH-MUC: 22 Dec 2013 to 11 Jan 2014. Business Class. MUC-DOH-MUC: Boeing 787. Seating was really nice and comfortable the inflight service was also very good all cabin crews were nice and friendly. Inflight entertainment system was also very nice. DOH-BKK-DOH: Boeing 777. The seating was really comfortable the inflight service was also very good but when came to bed time mattress was not offered the cabin crew stated that was only for a long haul flight but they do offer pyjamas. Inflight entertainment system was very good. Overall I was very happy and would recommended.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-14;BCN-DOH-DXB. January 9th. A disappointment overall. Check-in at BCN was quite chaotic same for boarding. Food was low quality with small portions seat pitch was small as usual and entertainment very reduced. Big black point from cabin crew: I asked for a tooth brush after meal response: no. Transfer at Doha was chaotic: I was very close to missing my flight due to a staff member at the security point. I had to make a ruckus at the line until he accepted to let me go. Always the same plastic - flavoured snack served on second leg DOH-DXB.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-14;ICN-LHR LHR-ICN. An excellent airline with excellent service I flew both business and first and the food comfort and attentiveness of the staff were truly 5 star. I will definitely be flying with them again. They put the European airlines business class to shame.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-14;We have flown Qatar Airways economy class 4 times in the past 15 months. As we are now living in Doha for work purposes 3 of those 4 flights originated in Doha. Doha to JFK to Florida and back to Doha. Our first two flights 12 months ago in economy class were very nice. Much better than the other airlines we have travelled on for international flights. However in the past 12 months the other two flights have shown a huge decrease in quality of service and a huge increase in cost. The main difference that seems glaring is the level of attentiveness from the Flight Attendants the quality of food that is now being served and the huge cost increase.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-14;We flew back from Delhi (QR 563) on 6th Jan. After an 8hr 21 min delay due to fog we discovered the aircraft was switched from the Dreamliner (787) to the A330. The switch in aircraft certainly extended the delay. The communication to update on the flight was terrible. Once we reached Doha we were told there was no other way back to NYC other than taking the flight on 7th Jan (QR 701). The transit process on 7th January felt was awful there was lack of communication. Once we reached the aircraft we waited and waited until the captain announced we would be delayed - ended up being 1hr 10 mins. While in the air the aircraft was new and we were lucky enough to have an emergency seat. The flight crew appeared tired and unwilling to be pleasant to passengers. Most of the food was barely edible. We landed and 1 hr and 32mins late with no apology or update from the pilot on our flight progress.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-13;Melbourne to Doha in Business class. 777-200LR. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The food was the best I've had in Business and a great anytime style menu. Seat was comfortable to sit in and the full lie flat beds were great. My wife and I both got a solid 8 hours sleep which is testament to the quality of the seat/bed. We were also provided with amenities pack and pyjamas which we made use of. Aircraft was modern and well looked after and flight smooth. I'd say its as good as if not better than Emirates business and considerably cheaper.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-13;Berlin - Doha - Melbourne in Economy. A330 Berlin - Doha. Seat comfort was very good and space no issue and I'm 6'3. Food was also very good for an economy flight. A choice of 3 meals. Flight attendants were polite and friendly but because they have so many people to look after can come across a bit rushed. Doha - Melbourne 777-200LR . Seats didn't feel quite as comfortable but it didn't help that the person in front was reclined the whole way but alas so did I. Still managed to have a sleep. Flight attendants were polite and friendly. Food served while ok wasn't as good as the previous flight. Total flying time was around 17.5 hours from Berlin which was the quickest we have ever done it in and good if you have kids. One thing to mention we did have quite a few families near us and the staff really looked after them which was good to see. gave them some toys cool lunch boxes with meals in them and a little play time etc. Plane to terminal is by bus in Doha but with their new airport which is almost finished being built I think it'll be a thing of the past.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-13;"IAH-DOH-MAA in Y. Check-in line looked horrendous at first but it moved well and we were on our way in about 30 minutes. I found it strange though that you first had to queue up for a baggage weight check then go to the counter and have your bags weighed again. IAH-DOH was in a B777-300ER. The 3-3-3 configuration that QR uses is far superior to the 3-4-3 setup that more and more airlines are using today as the extra inch or two of width provides a feeling of much more personal space. Seat pitch at 33 inches is also better than many long-haul carriers and as we had seats directly in front of a bulkhead had unlimited recline at our disposal which made for a more comfortable flight. I was able to get about 5 hours of sleep. Two meals are served with decent taste and quality and free wine beer and spirits available. I had heard horror stories about the transit procedure in DOH but found it quite painless and it took just 35 minutes to get from our plane through the bus ride and security and to our onward gate. Boarding process for our DOH-MAA leg was a bit chaotic. Boarding starts very early more than an hour before takeoff and you are initially herded into a holding area with far too few seats compared to the number of people. You are eventually boarded onto a bus followed by an extremely long ride to the plane at which point we were held for a further 5-10 minutes. Once on board everything was fine though I found the A330-200 considerably more cramped than the 777. The IFE box didn't help but the seats were also an inch narrower and with an inch less pitch. On both legs the IFE system is excellent with a wide variety of AVOD shows/movies and games along with a customizable flight map. Meal was the typical ""veg/non veg"" option you get headed to India and quality was not nearly as good as on the IAH-DOH leg. Service by the FAs was consistently excellent with every request attended to promptly and with a smile. Qatar offers a very good coach product overall and is a superior alternative to Emirates if you are headed to Asia or the Middle East.";POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2014-01-09;Doha - London LHR QR001. First Class Lounge at Premium Transfer Terminal very nice but boarding process was quite disorganized. The car that was to transfer me to the plane came only after all business class passengers left to buses while I had to wait at the gate door. Onboard the A330 was new and clean seats comfortable staff were very attentive and friendly. Food was outstanding the best first class food I ever had. The greatest drawback was the IFE. Films were very poorly chosen and there was quite a limited number of them. Will fly Qatar in the future but only if they improve their boarding process and IFE.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-09;BKK-DOH-HBE. Economy Class. It is the first time we have flown economy for a few years and will probably be the last. Seats are cramped person in front put his seat back when we tried the person behind complained so I was sitting 4 inches from the screen. Food average. Will travel again on Qatar but only in Business Class.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-09;21/12/13 LHR-DOH-BKK 5/01/14 BKK-DOH-LHR. What did I think of the service? In a word impressive! Now a days when some airlines seem to think of economy passengers as 'self loading cargo' it was refreshing to receive a level of service that I thought no longer existed! Very comfortable cabins very good catering and impressed with the cabin staff. Last time I flew to Asia I used Gulf Air: They out classed them.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-08;Flew Zurich-Doha-Bangkok in coach. What I experienced was not surprising but rather confirmed the different things I had read about them: first off the planes are almost brand new and in excellent shape. The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided. The transfer ride is tiring the terminal is awful and the food court easily the worst. All over a decent experience.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-08;24 Dec 2013 QR 002 LHR-DOH and QR 832 DOH-BKK 25 Dec. Boarding on both flights chaotic. Although staff called for boarding by seat numbers nobody took any notice. Both flights full service on board was poor to say the least. Inflight food although served hot was not appetising drink rounds for water and juices had to go to galley and ask for them only brought through cabin once on each sector. I'll revert to previous carriers.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-03;Travelled London (LHR) to Kilimanjaro (JRO) via DOH and DAR in economy. The check-in at London was smooth. I was not impressed with the Dreamliner (787) that QR used for the flight from London to Doha and vice versa. The IFE did not work so we didn't have anything to watch or listen to. Some of the toilets were already in a mess. FAs were friendly and helpful. I should give them credit for trying to make the journey enjoyable. Flight from Doha to Kilimanjaro and the return flight were OK. The food was also average. Would I recommend QR? I would if you get the right price and if there is no choice.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-03;Stockholm to Doha and Doha to Hong Kong and then returned the same way. During all of my flights the inflight entertainment system did not work properly for my seat and when it finally worked the screen was so scratched that it was hard to see anything. The seats were comfortable because the flight was almost empty yet the food could be classed only as average. When wanting to change the date of my return flight I was not helped at all on the phone nor through email/ website and when I actually went physically to their office in HK I was refused a change despite me wanting to pay for the difference. I cannot recommend them due to the service issues.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-03;Economy SIN-ZRH-SIN via Doha. Flight operations were fine helped by the mostly very friendly and responsive staff and the use of state-of-the-art equipment (777/787). The choice and quality of the food was however nothing to rave about. Whatever its length any layover at Doha is painful to say the least. This is partially due to the poor infrastructure of the airport but also due to the rather chaotic organization of the airline's ground operations. On the way back I had a 8+ hour layover. I did not want to spend this time at the airport and booked a hotel. When enquiring at Zurich airport if I could leave the airport at Doha I was informed that this may be difficult. We still got off at the Arrival Terminal and - while the waiting period (about 1 hour) and the visa-on- arrival charge was a kick in the teeth immigration was smooth but getting away from the airport was again somewhat frustrating. The airline has potential but has to improve its ground services. In any case I will not take another flight with Qatar Airways until the new Doha airport is operational.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2014-01-02;Flew SIN-DOH-IAD in late October 2013 on J Class. As always excellent Bollinger served. I like the eat on demand service as we can time the meals. Great choice and great amenities. On route back we had a 8.5 hour lay over and had booked a room. But the thought of negotiating immigration was not very appealing and whiled away the time in the Premium lounge. Had sleeper couches and even fresh blankets and a great shower with L'Occitane toiletries. Spoilt for choice when it came to food.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-29;NBO-DOH-SGN. Aircraft's A320 and A330-200 respectively. No lounge access could be granted in NBO despite being a gold card holder. Hotel provided in Doha (upon prior request) as layover exceeded 8 hours. However due to Xmas transitters for hotels were stuck in immigration queues for almost 2 hours! It has hardly worth it. However the 4-star hotel provided in Doha was OK but somehow scraped. Doha-Saigon upgraded to business class from seat 30K to 1F. The business class standards are high food options plenty and service quick despite business class became full - mainly by those upgraded from economy which was completely overbooked. Seats not fully lie flat in the configuration encountered this time. A delay from Doha was unusual long for Qatar Airways. As a result we came to SGN 40 minutes late so I lost my onward connection and had to purchase new ticket from VN-airlines.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-29;DXB-DOH-BCN Dec 19th. Privilege Club golden membership is really appreciable: 15 kg extra luggage complimentary access to First Class lounge in Dubai and Barcelona and Oryx Lounge in Doha and (at least when it is respected) priority boarding. However the flight itself was not really enjoyable: chaotic take-off proceed at Dubai Doha transfer long and disorganised (as usual in that grotty old airport) and night flight to Barcelona in an uncomfortable Airbus A330-200. QR cabin crew did their best to make the journey pleasant with good PAX interaction). Gold and Silver Privilege Club members were treated personally as cabin crew called us by our name and gave us priority for breakfast preference (3 choices available between regular sweet and vegetarian). Flight arrived at El Prat on time and police and customs procedures were smooth. A good airline anyhow.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-25;KUL-Doha and Doha - MUC economy both sectors. Very happy with Dreamliner between Doha and Munich although I don't like the 3-4-3 seating arrangement.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-25;London to Doha in business on the new Airbus. Our flight attendants English wasn't very good and they were not as efficient as other airlines. My dinner was overcooked and too salty. Staff were very kind and gave me a different meal. I had issues with my TV. It kept cutting out the entire flight. The beds are rights next to one and other. I was lucky as I was traveling with my husband but if I was sleeping that close to a stranger I wouldn't have enjoyed it. With other airlines you can put up a screen which you can't do on this plane. Worst inflight TV selection I've seen on a plane. Old movies and only a few new western release movies. Arrived into Doha for a 6 hour stop over and the Business Lounge is already looking very tired. Qatar would not be my first choice next time I fly. Up side: Amazing pyjamas and toiletry bag.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-23;Have just completed 2 very much anticipated legs with Qatar Airways Paris to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. We were so disappointed which is hardly what I expected to be saying here Used Air France La Premiere lounge in Paris although nice had limited food offerings but comfortable. Boarding welcome and crew great but meal uninteresting and veal tough. Only served with rice. It did do the trick though as required no dessert. Cabin was not cleaned prior to landing. Our arrival in Doha was delayed which meant the long anticipated use of the Premium Lounge was not met as by the time we were bussed to terminal we were told we had to board in 10 minutes. No seating as lounge full to overflowing toilets dirty and two lots of security ate into our very limited time. Back on the bus and our flight to Melbourne. Greeted warmly and seats fantastic and for us that was where it ended. For first time Qatar users we were not informed that to eat we had to request and subsequently very little food actually offered for a 13 hour plus flight. When food was finally requested due to extreme hunger and no chance to eat at Doha we were told there would be a long wait as crew were resting. Very little cabin presence throughout flight. Pyjamas offered and most passenger used them but only saw one bed made up by crew. All in all not quite what we expected and if this particular flight is anything to go on will not fly with them again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-21;Sitting in the lounge at Doha waiting for the leg of my trip from Perth to London. Wanted to quickly comment on the first leg. Flight very full (probably sold out) but service slow even despite this. Normally trays removed immediately but left sitting in front of us for nearly an hour. No extra drinks offered. Request for blanket never materialised. Vegetarian Hindu meal very average. Entertainment very good. Note for those looking for an upgrade: had a phone call on the day of flight asking me to go first class on following day's flight. Unfortunately couldn't do it but worth knowing it can be offered.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-21;"Doha - Oslo. Attentive but unobtrusive crew. The 787 business class seat is outstanding and the entertainment screen is huge and sharp. Such a shame they fail horribly with the remote control/user interface. It is very slow and unresponsive. Whenever I tried to pause a film it would instead jump to the middle and I'd spend a lot of time fiddling and trying to get back to where I was. Several TV-shows (new) were of such low technical quality they might have been VHS recordings. The never-ending commercials that take over the entertainment system at the end of each flight are quite annoying. And please come up with a ""do not disturb"" solution. I don't like being woken up for a meal if I'm finally asleep.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-17;VCE-DOH-MEL. The VCE-DOH leg was on a A320: comfy seats however not the full flat bed which is fine considering that it is only a 5.5hrs flight. The DOH-MEL was very comfortable full flat bed very nice amenities from the pyjama to the slippers to the toiletries. very much appreciated the larger bathroom very good AVOD. Service has been gracious and attentive all the way through food served was tasty and freshly prepared. The business lounge in DOH welcoming and with a good food variety a lot of space for everyone and good facilities. Pity that you have to take the shuttle from the aircraft to the airport and return but I'm sure it will be resolved with the new terminal. I must add that I was a bit taken aback by the behaviour of the staff upon arrival in MEL: some paramedics and public health officers boarded the plane as soon as the gangway was connected and the flight attendants seemed to be very unprepared to handle the traffic flow of passengers off the aircraft and the boarding officers: very bizarre!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-16;NBO-DOH-MXP and return. Flights on time and check in smoothly. Outbound: No lounge access given in NBO despite lounges are becoming restored upon the fire in August. NBO-DOH: Small aircraft A320. Onboard: Food plenty 2 options given for dinner. Drinks also plenty. Wines are the same 4 which has been offered for the recent 3 years. No options to select beer apart from Heineken. Juices few and no innovations for years. IFE on A320 (NBO-DOH) ridiculous (overhead monitors showing soap). Premium frequent flyers identified and respected by crew given some preferential options (food luggage seating). The A330-200 flights (DOH-MXP-DOH) were also pretty full. IFE good. Service OK to good. Note for QR flights departing after midnight that only breakfasts are offered in economy (three choices though). Champagne served MXP-DOH. MXP lounge used by QR was excellent with a super view to the runways (separate review). DOH-NBO: Upgraded to business class as economy was full/almost full. Excellent service. Dinner served 01:30 - 4 options for hot main dish. Two class-champagnes offered and high-class wines as well. 10 of 12 seats in business were taken (of which 2-3 were assumed upgrades). No lie flat but OK for 5 hours flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-13;On time comfort safety excellent service and professional crew on all flights - YYZ-JFK-DOH-DXB and return DXB-DOH-LHR using Qatar Airways and last leg LHR-YYZ with AC. Hoping one day will fly direct from Toronto.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-12;Taken the flight from SIN-DOH-BUC and back. Uses Boeing 777 for SIN-DOH and Airbus 320 for BUC-DOH. Overall the plane quality and cleanliness are good or above average but in regards to the facilities the USB port on the seats on all airlines seems not to work properly. It doesn't charge properly. It may seems small matters but arriving in a destination without working phone is troublesome and unable to contact anyone in emergency. Service on the BUC-DOH was rude and ignorant. Request for flight attendant was turned off without questioning on the issue.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-12;First time with Qatar from Venice to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Outbound flight with an A320 as amended (less seats) with super space between the seat and the seat. My children have been pampered for the whole journey both outward and return flights. Clean air great food. Only problem the return flight from KLIA was 3 hours late. However a great company.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-11;Traveled with my wife JFK-DOH-Cochin last month. Overall the flights were okay but to the food quality has nothing special. The service of cabin crew was good and satisfactory. Having traveled long haul flights with Qatar Airways before I am used to their service which is good.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-11;Flight from Manchester to Bali (8/11/13) was a pleasant experience with fantastic crew on both legs. We even got a honeymoon cake on the first leg. Not a problem with the airline at all just some rude travellers flying with us. MAN-DOH Airbus A330-200 a bit tired but by no means old DOH-DPS Boeing 777-200ER modern aircraft and comfortable. The return journey however was a shambles (20/11/13). Denpasar to Doha with a stop in Singapore. DOH-MAN was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head Flight Attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears. Older aircraft and a fair few AVOD systems not working including my own for the first 30 minutes of the flight. All they could do was reset it.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-09;DPS-ORD-DPS. Our flight was delayed 4 hours out of Denpasar due to APEC being held in Bali and the airport being closed to the public at certain hours of the day. We knew this in advance and asked to change our flight a day earlier as we only had a 3 hour lay over in Doha before our flight to Chicago. Qatar assured us that the airport closure would not affect them and that changing our flight would incur a fee. We were met at Doha airport by ground staff who gave us the option of staying overnight or flying to Chicago without our luggage. As we had only two nights in Chicago we decided to fly without our luggage. The luggage arrived at our hotel the next day. In the air we always find the product and the service given very good and of a uniform quality. Our return flight left on time from Chicago with a 5 hour wait for our flight to Bali. This turned into a 12 wait as our flight was delayed. The captain made an announcement explaining the delay and apologized for any inconvenience This is the second time I have experienced problems with connections being late and whilst I understand these things happen I hope it does not become the norm. It feels like this airline is growing very fast and needs the new airport and new aircraft to keep up with demand. Their business class product is very good and we were not disappointed once we were in the air.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-05;Travelled on LHE-DOH-MAN flight in economy class. LHE-DOH was with 777-ER and had comfortable seats but DOH-MAN was A330 an old model with really congested seats. Not only this but inflight crew were not helpful. Food quality is just enough but most of all I found Doha airport really dis-satisfactory. The transit terminal and arrivals are served with buses and that makes transit very painful especially if travelling with kids. I am not impressed with Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-12-02;Flew Business class on Goa-Doha-New York (JFK) on 13 Nov and return on 27 Nov New York (JFK) - Doha-Goa. The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities. All in all a very satisfying experience and we would surely fly Qatar airways again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-29;"Stockholm-Doha-Kochi (India) on Nov 26. I have done this trio many times with QR and I'm very satisfied. The new Dreamliner from Stockholm to Doha is very comfortable spacious and silent. But I couldn't see that the windows were bigger! A spacious galley with fruits cakes and an unopened champagne bottle. Plenty of space for legs hand baggage and computer reading materials and other small things at the seat. The toilet are very spacious. On the Doha-Kochi sector they have put in bigger aircraft's with ""angled lie flat chairs"" in Business class. A big improvement to the old planes on this sector. Very friendly staff competent they managed to make my computer hook on to the WiFi system onboard. In QR business class you can get food served whenever you want. On an earlier flight on the same sector they wanted to serve a third dinner on the flight Doha-Kochi (the two earlier were on Stockholm-Doha and in Doha terminal) but I asked for breakfast instead and they gave me a really good breakfast! The staff was apologetic that they couldn't give me an omelette but I tried to convince them that it didn't matter. I call that service. I feel the staff onboard is QR's best resource airport staff are very good too.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-28;MAN-DOH-BKK-HAN-SGN-DOH-MAN. Really impressed with the seats service and entertainment on all flights. World class airline in same bracket as Emirates and Etihad. Arguably Singapore Airlines still marginally superior. 777 seats wider and entertainment system better than A330 however 2-4-2 layout is preferable for couples relative to the 3-3-3 777 layout. Fortunate to be upgraded to business on the red eye SGN - DOH flight which was great notwithstanding that particular A330 being an older example. Still extremely comfortable and accommodated an excellent night's sleep. Check in for all sectors fine Doha airport bus transfers a bit of a novelty but acceptable and soon to be replaced. Will certainly use the airline again if priced most competitively as was the case in this instance.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-22;Bangkok-Doha-Cairo and back. All in all a very pleasant and civilized experience. Reservation and online check in and seat selection a breeze. At the airport very pleasant staff and my online check in had me bypass a rather huge line at the regular check in as I only needed a baggage drop off. The colour coding of Qatar Airways and the airport is great. The check-in was handled in Bangkok perfectly with rows as well as seats navigated from the left 1 and 2 doors. This resulted in a very speedy and no stress boarding of a fully booked huge airliner. Staff were great with a personal service but without the over-cheesy attitude of another Middle Eastern airline. The food was good and the staff ran every 30-45 minutes with drink rounds. Connection was short and the airport OK. Flight to Cairo was good and the staff had to work double to control passengers that simply ignore every and each announcement from standing while landing etc. The return flight was good but certain points ruined the perfect first impression. Check in was closed but the screens were on and staff at economy check in with a large crowd. The boarding was terrible but I guess I can attest to the less than friendly Cairo terminal 1 holding gates that is barely enough for a small plane but not a 100% booked 777-300. It was a bit of chaos and people standing everywhere. Very claustrophobic. I would suggest Qatar to change its check in counters from the very tight side of T1 as there was no space whatsoever and to request 2 gates since at the moment of waiting to be bussed to the plane it was a less than 1 star experience. Otherwise the flights were on time food great and staff consistent. Definitely will recommend and I believe that the new airport in Qatar is desperately needed. The transfer was very easy and rather pleasant but the terminal was a bit too basic. So 7/10 just for not being able to handle check in and boarding as elegantly as in Bangkok. Qatar should look into it.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-21;4 Nov Houston-Doha QR714 and 15 Nov Doha-Houston QR713. Business class. Check in at Houston: the desk staff did not know whether coach class seats had power outlets. They do as anyone can find out on the Qatar Airways website. Continuing with the flight attendants. They all seemed to be in-training: could not remember to bring coffee or water even though they were very attentive just not very efficient. On both ways my choice of food was not available. I had to ask 2 or 3 times each way for dessert. The 777LR aircraft in a 2x2x2 business class configuration is not very comfortable being trapped for 16 hours between a window and a sleeping passenger. Doha Airport on both arrivals and departures is undeserving of the beautiful and progressive country of Qatar. Taking my hand luggage down the stairs up the bus off the bus up to immigration is a chore and nobody from the airline offered any help. Overall not a bad airline.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-21;IAD-DOH Flight 708 on a 777-300 ER. Food was fine the guy at the check in counter changed my seat three times as people checked in to get me an empty bulkhead row so good on him. Onboard the service was awful. My flight attendant had a scowl rushed passed me at every opportunity and was really surly with requests.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-18;PER-DOH-LHR and return. Having never flown with Qatar (normally a Singapore customer) I was tempted by the price and time saved by flying through the Middle East. Can't really fault the experience too much and would recommend them. The PER-DOH flight was a 777 and very comfortable. Lots of leg room and space - felt very relaxed. Entertainment was good too with plenty of films etc. The new Dreamliner flight from DOH-LHR was nearly as good but definitely more cramped. Knees pressing against seat in front. Those IFE boxes have a lot to answer for especially on aisle seats - feet space is minimal. Luckily for me on all 4 flights I had no one sitting next to me so could stretch out. May have been lower score if flight was full. Food and service on all flights was as good as it gets although return trip to Perth was a bit lacking as they were tight with offering up water. Doha airport is in the middle of an upgrade so it was a bit chaotic but ok. Definitely would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-15;TRV-DOH-LHR Nov 12 Business. My first Qatar flight taking advantage of the airline joining OneWorld. And in one word - excellent. A320 (or was it 321?) out of Trivandrum to Doha big comfortable seat - a proper business/1st class seat not a pretend one like most airlines use on their single-aisle short-haul aircraft. A 50-minute transfer in Doha which went very smoothly (would I have made it if I'd had baggage or been in economy?) and a lie-flat seat on a 777 to LHR. Very attentive FAs decent food excellent AVOD on time (actually half-hour early in to LHR thanks to wind).;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-15;MAN-DOH-BOM return 24th Oct. Standards have dropped compared to previous experiences out of 4 legs only on 2 legs reserved seats with infant were honoured. Staff attitude in air as well as on ground not very friendly.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-14;BCN-DOH-DXB. A good flight but nothing impressive. Jacquart Champagne and Janneau Cognac were served during the flight cabin crew was very attentive. However food options limited and quite low-quality. IFE poor this time with a very small choice of new movies and music albums. Seats were quite comfortable. All-day snack is very repetitive for frequent flyer always the same pizza and almond cake! Transfer at Doha was ok but I hate that old airport. It's a good new to know that they will shift soon to new terminal.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-04;CPH-DOH-NBO. NBO-DOH-CPH. Been doing this leg every summer since 2011 loved the trip. Chatted with the Cabin Crew. The service was excellent hard working staff in DOH. Nairobi Staff were too serious could smile a little more. Food was ok but I would like some changes as the meals have been the same over the last 2 years. IFE was excellent but the seat space was a little too tight. Excited to Fly with QR again this December and can't wait to Experience the 787 from CPH!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-11-01;ATH-DOH-DXB on 320 and 787 respectively. All flights on time with smooth transfers in DOH. That said new airport must open ASAP as it will make the experience much more pleasant. Staff attentive and friendly but would have liked to see a few more smiles especially during service time. Food and beverages good well presented. Cabin atmosphere nice and relaxing but the seat comfort on the dreamliner not so good. Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options. DOH-DXB we were not offered headphones because 'it is a very short flight' as we were advised. Their 4-star competition does offer headsets on this route though. All in all a nice experience would definitely recommend but a little overestimated airline.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-30;MAN-DOH-BKK. Check in at Manchester was fine due to my height 6ft’6 I'd asked for a note to be posted on the system asking for a seat with extra legroom. Priority boarding for Privilege Club members took off a few minutes late flight seemed to be full. The cabin crew soon were coming around with drinks and menus entertainment system ready for use I checked what was on offer and was watching my first choice movie when the meal was served. I had a chicken noodle dish which was one the best meals I'd had in economy class. I rarely sleep on a flight but I may have dozed off for a few minutes before watching a few more movies. Arrived at Doha earlier than expected I had 1 hour 20 minutes transit so had booked the Al Maha Fast track service a very efficient young lady met me at the plane and travelled with me on the transfer bus escorted me direct to the onward check-in for the next flight and straight passed the queue to the departure bus. Bangkok flight was on 777 a vast improvement on the airbus comfort wise similar to previous flight movie and a little doze had a walk down to the galley for a drink and spent some time chatting to the cabin crew. A nice breakfast and arrived in Bangkok on time. Luggage already on the conveyor by the time I'd cleared customs. When I checked in for return flight I used my Qmiles to upgrade to business class from Doha - Manchester so checked in at the business counter and discovered I'd been upgraded to Silver level so I was given access to the priority customers clearance and a pass to the business lounge a nice surprise. Just after boarding the senior cabin attendant came to see me and explained she was aware that my next flight was in business and that prior to landing in Doha she would move me to a seat closer to the business cabin so I could go on the business class but direct to the premium terminal. I spent 8 hours in Doha that the reason for the upgrade to business had a nice dinner followed by breakfast before boarding the flight. Business cabin had only 10 passengers so we were all spoilt by the best cabin crew I've experienced members of the crew introduced themselves and chatted to passengers.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-29;We flew recently from London to Kuala Lumpur Malaysia via Doha. The entire trip (to and from) consisted of four 7-hour flights with approximately 2-4 hours stopover at Doha Airport. While we do not have any major complaints Qatar Airways in our opinion do not deserve a 5* airline rating for economy class. The cleanliness of the plane left a lot to be desired. On all four legs of the journey scraps of litter could be seen near the window seats. Food remnants were found on the fold-down table and on the cushion supplied. We were generally satisfied in terms of the level of service food entertainment and the comfort of seat. The touch screen can be a bit hit-and-miss and on one of our flights my partner's TV screen was faulty. Staff were all very polite although it would be interesting to see how they cope if the plane was busier. Previous experience with Emirates were far more satisfactory.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-29;Travelled during eid holidays from AUH-DOH-KHI and vice versa. The service was good. However the seats were not that comfortable. Apart from this issue everything was good. Would definitely travel again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-29;BRU-DOH-CCU and back. Flights food and service were more or less ok they took us to the destination with a minor delay. What bothered us was: Half of the plane was very hot and the other half was freezing (same thing happened last year). That each of us including a 2-year old baby were assigned seats in an entirely different location. The entertainment systems often had some minor faults (kept fast forwarding movies if one put their arm on the armrest some buttons did not work at all). Will try a different route next time if possible.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-29;JNB-DOH-ALG Sept. This is my second time with Qatar. The hand-lotion had disappeared 30 minutes after departure and was not been replaced. The airport is so crowed (might not be the fault of the airline) maybe not for business flyers (hopefully it can join One-World quicker so that when I use the airport next time I can use their lounge). The super cheap ticket is good that it is accessible for many people but the coin definitely has another side!;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-23;Round-trip JFK-DOH-AMD. Overall excellent experience on all counts. Friendly and courteous staff. Purser came around to make personal introduction and to explain flight amenities. Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch (including a 2003 Brunello di Montalcino). All flights were on time or early. The only strange part of the whole experience is the long bus ride from the plane to the terminals - I did it twice as I was transiting through DOH. The Business Class Lounge is probably one of the most grand and well-served that I have experienced. There are multiple stations for tea/coffee snacks full meals and a fully stocked bar. They also provide table service. Flight departures are announced discreetly but effectively.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-15;YUL-DOH-DAC. Sep 27 2013. Our flights were on time. We were very well received on board. The service was great. The flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. The Premium Lounge in Doha is very comfortable meeting all our needs and transit time was short. We've been flying this route for 3 years now and have not had any delays. We flew a B777-200 to Doha and A330-200 to Dhaka. Just love the young fleet. The only negative is that the lie flat beds on theA330 which do not completely lie flat are not as comfortable as on the B777. Can't wait to fly Qatar again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-15;QR 31 21/9 QR 19 22/9 QR 20 11/10 and QR 30 12/10. Have just returned to Melbourne from Paris having done the same sectors last year. Another faultless (as far as they can be) flying experience. Good food wine and service. Although a nice terminal at Doha the transfer is a bit lengthy. Wouldn't hesitate to fly with Qatar again. Entertainment selection not huge but OK.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-15;LHR-DOH-NBO. Flew the Dreamliner 787 from LHR-DOH fantastic aircraft great in-flight entertainment the steward(ess's) were all friendly and smiling food was really tasty seats were comfortable too. Transfer from aircraft to terminal in Doha was quite lengthy but guess that will improve once they have the new terminal. From DOH-NBO it was an A320 small aircraft but comfortable and again good food and service throughout. The only complaint I have about the flight was that my flight was from 16.00 GMT+1 arriving in NBO 05.35 (GMT+1) and on the LHR-DOH leg they said they don't provide amenity kits because its a day flight (I only wanted the sleeping shades) and then when I got onto the DOH-NBO flight again they don't provide the amenity kits (the flight was from 02.20 - 07.35 GMT+3). Then they serve Dinner on this 2am flight without a doubt the foods great but its 2am and I wanted to sleep. So if your flying on some overnight flight then take your own in economy!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-13;LHR-DOH and DOH-SIN economy. Great flight in economy from LHR-DOH. Seats comfortable service excellent and inflight entertainment good. Overnight flight and managed to get sleep. Only criticism is they turned lights on a bit early before landing in DOH. Had a quick transfer in DOH for flight to SIN but waited on ground for other connections so flight departed 80 mins late. Plane from DOH to SIN a 777 which was bigger than 330. Again seats good but service very poor with 2 cabin attendants who must have come from BA they were so surly. Inflight entertainment system slower than the flight from LHR. On plus side the 2 flights were the smoothest and quietest I have ever had from UK to SIN. Airline a good 4 star but not 5.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-13;My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-10;Aspires to be a 'five' star airline. We flew UK to Malaysia via Doha two 7hr legs with a 3hr stop over in Doha. Planes were pretty clean seats fairly comfortable but we had a much newer plane on the 2nd outbound leg and this was the best leg of our return trips. Staff were very nice drinks plentiful and varied food pretty good too. Entertainment system worked fine good selection of films/TV to keep you busy. MAS we have flown before are a 5* airline the planes and service just that bit better though you do pay more. Baggage allowance was increased just before we flew to 30kg. They are also fairly relaxed on hand luggage which does mean the overhead storage fills up! The transfer in Doha involved a lengthy bus shuttle to/from the terminal building but perhaps we were unlucky where our planes were parked. I'd use again but would weigh up the saving over a direct flight as there's not much in Doha!;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-10;MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-09;Flew from Heathrow to Kathmandu. Everything was good until Doha however a bit sad from Doha to Kathmandu. It was bit tight but overall experience was excellent.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-02;IAH-DOH-CCU-DOH-IAD September 23 2013. IAH-DOH - Incoming aircraft had a lightening strike on its way in and needed a complete check by engineers in Houston. This delayed the flight by over 5 hours and everyone missed connections in DOH. Qatar staff in Doha came through for everyone with alternate flights already worked out by the time we reached DOH. Most people were provided transit visas and accommodation with a generous food allowance in DOH. IFE was good food was okay. Cabin staff was polite and helpful. DOH-CCU - Cabin crew excellent. I had a non functional IFE screen and they tried a restart thrice. After that they switched my seat. The food service was thorough service was attentive and I felt comfortable in a flight with service after a long time. CCU-DOH - Good cabin crew good food and attentive service. Ground staff from Air India could not keep up with the Qatar staff and fumbled the service all through. On the flight smooth sailing. DOH-IAH - Attentive cabin crew and good service all round. The only negative was when they ran out of meal options for the lunch service and had to force the same veg option on everyone. IFE malfunctioned during the flight and they reset the whole system that took 30 mins or so. However IFE service was good. Overall satisfied with the service crew and IFE. It would be better for them to rethink their Indian choice for veg as the food tends to get too dry over a long haul flight.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-10-01;SIN-DOH-MAN/BRU-DOH-SIN. Excellent on-board service and the seat pitch is the best I have seen in Economy for a long time. The 777s use 3-3-3 configuration which makes for a comfortable seat. Pouches with toothbrush socks ear plugs and eye-mask were given out on the overnight sectors. Only thing that could get better was on the BRU- DOH sector crew ran out of food trays at the back of the plane and had to ask a few times from the crew in the front. I also had to remind the crew that my travelling companion needed a diabetic meal. But these are small issues. In all value for money better than the other airlines who try to pack close to 400 passengers on their 777s for the same price.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-29;"PER-DOH-JFK PER-DOH-CDG MXP-DOH-PER. Great new fleet even the older A320s and A330s are new compared to other major airlines. Newer 777s are gorgeous though have flaws (like stuck TV screens and dirty seats). Food is average. When connecting for hours in Doha you still find yourself with a breakfast omelette followed by another breakfast omelette on the next flight? Entertainment system - good when it works. Great selection but on 6 flights I had 3 seats without working TV and 4 headphones that did not work. Service - pretty poor. Staff are generally indifferent friendly-but-dazed. Timeliness - my experience has not tracked with the on-time stats of the airline. I had one out of six flights depart on time. The rest arrived late by an hour or so. Very decent option for the price but not anywhere as good an experience as its ""5 Star"" competitors such as Singapore or Cathay.";NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-25;"BKK-CDG w/a change in Doha and CDG-BKK. This is the 2nd time I have flown w/ Qatar this year and each leg the service is friendly and efficient and the Food is really good. Not to mention their on-time departures. The seats have sufficient space even reclines (well for me at least at 5'7""). They have great selection of food and entertainment and if your lucky enough for an overnight flight a great pouch consisting of socks eye-mask and toothbrush. Anytime you ask for help or are served the flight attendants have a smile. For the money - this is by far my favorite airline.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-25;SIN-DOH-BRU and TXL-DOH-SIN. Food onboard was acceptable. Seats were fairly comfortable. Inflight service ranged from average to outstanding depending on the flight attendant. Inflight entertainment was very good. The problem was the transit at Doha it was nothing short of a disaster. The buses that take you to and from the terminal were excruciatingly slow and extremely packed. Even though the bus doors were shut the buses didn't move and we were on the tarmac for about 15 minutes. No announcement no apologies. The terminal itself was packed when we got there and clearly did not have enough toilets. While they were not downright filthy they were certainly not the cleanest toilets in any airport anywhere. After having our boarding pass scanned for the transfer flight we took an escalator down to the waiting area in the bus bay. We waited more than an hour there with about 10 seats no toilets in a room that could comfortably only hold 25 passengers but is now holding a whole plane load. Many started sitting/sleeping on the floor. When it was time to board the bus a stone faced staff member came down to tell us to queue up. Again no announcement no apologies just do as you're told. When the bus got to the plane surprise surprise the doors stayed closed and we stayed inside the packed bus for another 15 minutes. Only on the plane did the captain explain that the aircraft came in late resulting in the delay. I wouldn't want to do another transit in Doha again at least not until their new airport is completed.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-24;SIN-DOH-LHR-DOH-SIN. New plane for SIN-DOH-SIN good service but not comparable with SQ or CX. DOH-LHR-DOH on dated A330 Inflight entertainment system old with technical issues both ways. However will still use QR for its cheap fare.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-24;London to Dubai via Doha. The service received from the check in desk to all air crew was impeccable. Seats were of good comfort in economy and leg room was good as well. Inflight entertainment had a large number of choices to choose from. A bit of everything for everyone. Was travelling with a 5 Year old and catered their needs well as well as giving well presented child's meal. Only the transfer at Doha needs to improve a bit as having go by coach to the transit and aircraft is annoying. But overall very good and the best service I have had on anyone airline I have travelled that includes BA Virgin and emirates.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-24;We flew to Manchester from HK last month with our baby son. On 3 legs of the trip the service and general experience could not be faulted in particular the cabin crew were genuinely caring for our son providing him with chocolates toys and carrying him around the airplane. On the Doha - Manchester leg of the journey the service was appalling very offhand perhaps not helped by the fact there were extra demands on the attendants due to the fact the in-flight entertainment was not working but our baby son was ignored right down to fact there was no offer of baby food for him! So 3 legs unsurpassed service far superior to my experience on my regular business class airlines but of course what one remembers unfortunately was the one poor experience which was made more memorable by how good the rest of the journey was.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-24;SIN-DOH-LHR-DOH-SIN. New plane for SIN-DOH-SIN good service but not comparable with SQ or CX. DOH-LHR-DOH on dated A330 Inflight entertainment system old with technical issues both ways. However will still use QR for its cheap fare.;POSITIVE

qatar-airways;2013-09-22;Been a Qatar frequent flier for a couple of years. Gold card holder and choose Qatar as the preferred airline. Generally extremely Professional and experienced crew. In recent times have noticed that the quality of Food can be much better. I generally choose AVML as the Choice. On the last flight from DOH-OSL I was served a chicken sandwich instead of vegetarian. Been served Pasta as AVML on one of the flights. Food quality is one thing that I believe that QR has dropped in. Customer service is still good (even if an occasional mistake happens). The thing that I did not like on my OSL-DOH flight is that they introduced the 787. I would any day prefer the Comfort of the 777-300ER.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-22;Return flight to from London to KL via Doha. 3 of the 4 aircraft's were modern and clean with great in-flight entertainment (all newish A330s) and very good food. Last flight (Doha to London) was awful. Old A330 very smelly not especially clean and rubbish in-flight entertainment. A real disappointment but would not put me off flying Qatar again as generally excellent. Doha airport isn't as bad as everyone says but the busses to and from the terminal do take forever and aren't particularly well air conditioned.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-22;LHR-DOH-DXB-DOH-LHR. 4 flights on B787/A320/A330. Excellent flights with very smart and professional cabin crew. The meals were tasty and of good quality and nicely presented. 5 star and very happy to travel again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-19;BKK-DOH 16/09/2013. A true 5 star airline. Seats very spacious and comfortable. Staff very attentive and helpful. Great selection of food IFE very good with a great range of new release and classic films. Will fly Qatar whenever possible.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-15;Had high expectations flying with this 5 star airline. We decided on the route MAD-DOH-BKK-DOH-MAD to fly with Qatar for the first time. It was basically all above average but a bit short for a 5 star. No surprises all was efficient smooth and professional. The 777-300 was used on all our four flights. Great entertainment system although the boxes takes up some leg space. Food was correct and service professional but felt quite robotic. Drinks were served frequently during the flights. Planes were all clean and in very good appearance. Doha airport is a problem long bus rides to and from the plane. This will be solved once the new airport opens. We hoped for it to be so before our trip but they still have no date.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-12;Perth WA to London LHR on 8 August. I have never felt so well looked after onboard any airline. Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE. Again wonderful entertainment. The food was wonderful at all parts of the journey and various meals are provided with generous portions. The cabin crew were so professional and smart very friendly. I am very much looking forward to flying Qatar again.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-05;MAN-DOH-SIN-DOH-MAN. A330 first leg. Really comfortable seat but preferred 777 on second leg which was perfect lie flat seat and so much roomier. Staff were excellent and couldn't do enough - very polite and attentive. Good Oryx system great headsets and good choice of films. Food excellent and as much drink as you like. The only disappointment was the 'fast track' luggage. Most of economy had left the airport whilst business class were still standing at the conveyor waiting for theirs 40 minutes later!;POSITIVE

While in general we were satisfied with the flights there are a number of issues I would like to raise: 1) We were seated in row 24 on QR30 about halfway down economy. When the meal trolley came we were told instead of the 3 meal options only one was still available. 2) When I asked for a glass of wine I was told it would be brought later. It arrived after my meal was finished. 3) On the return leg my wife who has a bladder problem asked if the trolley could be moved to allow her out. She was told she would have to wait until the attendants had finished and were ready to move on. 4) QR31 25 August was heavily booked. When the lights were brightened after approximately 10 hours there was naturally a rush for the toilets. The number provided on the 777 is in my opinion inadequate. Long queues soon formed.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-03;MAA-DOH-CDG-JFK (round trip) with our 19 month old infant. CDG-JFK flight was hectic (AA flight) with no legroom. The food was fantastic and the crew were great. Oryx Entertainment system was really good and easy to handle. The whole experience was positive.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-02;KHI-DOH-JFK-DOH-KHI August 2013. Staff service still remains excellent. On JFK-DOH sector the cabin crew were the most efficient and helpful crew I have encountered in 20 years. On my last leg of journey the entertainment system was not working. Seat has limited recline. QR needs to improve or may lose the Business class segment of it's loyal customers. Premier lounge at Doha is still excellent but Premier lounge duty free shop has very limited selection of products.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-09-01;PER-DOH-LHR on 13 August and LHR-DOH-PER 24 August. 777's all flights. I had a great experience. Staff were very attentive plenty of drinks offered between meals. Food was adequate and on the longer legs there were sandwiches and cakes available in the galley. Seating comfortable the 3-3-3 configuration helps enormously. I was able to stretch out a bit due to some empty seats on the longer legs but even on the packed DOH-LHR flights it was great to have the leg room. The Oryx entertainment system was fine for me. Some new releases and plenty of old favourites. Nice to get an amenity kit on the longer flights also. I would definitely choose to fly with Qatar Airways again but it will be even better once the new airport is built in Doha.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-29;"DXB-DOH-BCN 2013 July 19th. A good flight overall but it quality of service went without a doubt down those last months. Always the same mess at DXB Terminal 1 check-in counter Dnata handling group is really a disaster. For this only reason you might prefer to fly Emirates which does not outsource its Terminal 3 to Dnata. Doha airport also was chaotic with very long bus rides and disorganized ground staff. Food service was appalling on DXB-DOH leg (a half burnt-half frozen spinach ""sandwich"") however breakfast and snack served on DOH-BCN flight were both good without being outstanding. Cabin crew were very professional and attentive to the aircraft's cleanliness. QR remains a good choice.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-29;"LHR-DOH-BKK return in economy. A frequent flyer with Qatar since 2009 I can say that they have really gone ""downhill"" and no longer deserve a 5* rating in economy class. While the aircraft are still modern with new aircraft always arriving the seats spacious (except for 787) and the in-flight entertainment is good the food and drinks have really become poor. They are as bad now as on many US carriers or worse. In contrast in 2009 Qatar had gourmet restaurant quality food. The levels and quality of service from most cabin crews has also declined to being very average. It is very rare for example to see a tray of drinks being carried around now between meals. Overall I would not recommend Qatar Airways any more.";POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-26;CAI-DOH-MCT. First sector was served with a very newish A320 which to me offered more comfort than travelling on an A330 or even a 77W the small a/c came equipped with PTVs wide selection of audio and video entertainment all you need and more for this medium haul flight. Food was better than my last EK trip last week but served in very small amounts. Transit in Doha was critically short in time however its nowhere close to EK's T3 at DXB. The next leg was a short hop to Muscat served with a very old and torn out A320 with over head entertainment system. Bottom line I choose QR because they offer the best fare every time I fly this route and its worth every penny.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-20;SIN-DPS-SIN. New B777 with 3-3-3 in economy vs 3-4-3 with Emirates giving plenty of room width ways and I could quite comfortably stretch out length ways. Nice cabin interior cabin crew responded quickly to the call button. Meal adequate for a two and a half hour flight in Y class. No news papers or magazines but the Oryx inflight entertainment would keep you from getting bored. Baggage allowance of 23kg adequate for a long weekend in Bali but Emirates and Etihad are now giving 30kg. Business class seats looked wide and comfortable compared to Etihad's which are a bit narrow. I look forward to flying on Qatar Airways again they are now on my favourite airline list.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-15;SIN-DPS return. SIN-DPS section delayed by an hour no explanation or apology given. Great seats and IFE. No blankets available food was like economy class food on chinaware. No Indonesia immigration cards so a further delay at DPS airport. DPS was a crowded lounge the comfortable section with sofas was for Qatar Airways crew on the flight. DPS- SIN average in terms of service and catering. Not really what I expect from a 5 star airline especially when flying business class.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-14;I would certainly fly them again. The Service was good the seats were roomy and the food delicious. I also liked that the flight length from Perth to Doha and then to Manchester was great. It was 10.5 hrs from here to Doha then 6.30 hrs from Dhoa to Manchester. Keep up the good work.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-13;BKK-DOH QR 615 April 2nd 2013. DOH-ZUR QR 061 April 3rd 2013. CDG-DOH QR 016 April 15th 2013. DOH-BKK QR 608 April 16th 2013. The crews are very polite helpful and very welcome. They are very service-minded. The leg room and foot rest is good.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-12;Flew first class CAI-DOH on QR503 on 8th Aug 2013. Qatar VIP lounge in CAI is a dump. VIP lounge is roofless and full of flies and A/C is pathetic. Can't really blame Qatar here it's an Egyptian problem. 95% of Qatar staff in CAI were good. Left CAI 20 mins early at 06.00 hrs. Travelled on Airbus A321 and was disappointed to find seats did not fully recline. Stewardesses and stewards were attentive and well-trained. Food and drink on board was top class. Aircraft was clean and fairly new and everything worked. Got to DOH and had 15 hr layover in VIP lounge there which is nothing short of outstanding. Showers TV's free internet recliner beds for snoozing massage chairs manned security lockers family area business facilities. Food and drink availability in VIP lounge is exceptional and all staff were eager to please courteous and well-trained. This airline is punctual and truly a 5 star airline and I will fly with them again anytime.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-06;GVA-AUH A320. Good food but after the main meal nothing else was served which I find a bit disappointing. Flight attendants served plenty of drinks throughout the flight. My IFE froze and I asked the FA to try to reset it but she never did. Seat pitch just OK. Overall a good product compared to European carriers.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-06;I took a flight to London on 17th July with my 3.5 year old son and wife. Travelling with kids is not easy as they constantly require something to focus their attention to without which they can easily get irritable. We were hoping that the inflight entertainment system would provide ample entertainment to keep my son occupied. Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything. Eventually it turned out to be a boring flight as well as a stressful one. What's more the pilot did not even acknowledge that there was a problem as he should have at least apologized to all the passengers with regards to this shortcoming.;POSITIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-06;MAD-DOH-DXB and back. Boeing 777 in MAD-DOH sectors was nice spacious 3-3-3 configuration and good legroom and IFE. Service and food was good but not outstanding as one expects from a 5-star airline. Boeing 787 in DOH-DXB sectors was amazing very modern and quiet airplane although seating would be a little bit tight for a long haul flight. The worst thing about Qatar Airways is Doha Airport it is very uncomfortable. It was crowded bathrooms were dirty and food options very limited. We had a very long bus ride from the terminal to the plane in the DOH- DXB flight. While boarding for the DOH-MAD flight we had to wait for half an hour for the bus to take us to the plane standing for that time in a crowded and small room at 2am is not a 5-star experience. I won't fly with them again until the opening of the new Doha Airport.;NEGATIVE
qatar-airways;2013-08-05;London Heathrow - Yangon via Doha return. First three flights were okay - check in staff at LHR a little rude. Economy class seating meal options inflight entertainment all very reasonable but I didn't see the five star airline reputation particularly. Final leg Myanmar to Doha was overbooked and I was kicked off with nosearch for volunteers (seemingly as were a lot of other single male travellers) resulting in a 13 hour layover in Doha. Placed on a 2am flight home and Doha airport was dreadful - food appalling customer service desk rammed and understaffed the staff who were on duty were rude and nobody actually seemed to know where my luggage was. DOH-LHR I have never been treated so rudely by airline staff (told I was in the wrong area when I accidentally went to the wrong toilet). There was a total lack of organisation with this airline.;NEGATIVE
