malaysia-airlines;2018-09-06;" |  Singapore to Kathmandu via Kuala Lumpur. Enjoyed the flight experiences. Cabin crews were very friendly and responsive. They was a delayed for departure, however, the captain explained in detailed the reason of the late take off. Well done MAS!";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-09-03;" |  London to Denpasar  via Kuala Lumpur. The complaints about the journey, overall, are fairly minor, however an accumulation of these minor issues alongside the abysmal customer complaints service has warranted this review. Firstly, our flight was delayed. This happens and there is no point in complaining, however, there was no communication between the airline and passengers. In the end, we went to ask someone what was going on and they told us ‘Oh its only a minor delay, 20-40 minutes’. 2 hours later we boarded without any further communication following the initial and somewhat obscenely inaccurate estimation. This was, again, minor, but we had a interconnecting flight with a 2 hour 20 minute gap (which had now been reduced by 2 hours to just 20 minutes) and we had no idea what was going to happen. Would it have been too much trouble to make an announcement? My magazine pouch had a massive hole in it. My stuff went everywhere and I had to get on my hands and knees to retrieve it all.  My boyfriend’s on board entertainment system did not work. When he asked a member of staff if there was anything they could do to help, (not expecting much but it was worth asking) he was laughed at. They eventually confirmed his seat number and ran a reboot, but it did not work. None of the charging ports were working. It was just so frustrating for him having to sit and do nothing for the duration of the flight. In truth, we rotated seats and shared the burden. I was feeling extremely rough at one point during the 14h flight so I went to the back of the plane to be near the facilities. There was a row of 3 reserved seats for staff rest. Whilst it was completely unoccupied, and had been for well over 2 hours, my boyfriend asked a member of staff if I could rest there for a short while just so I could be next to the toilet. Very kindly, I was allowed. But we were abruptly asked to leave the area immediately and return to our seats by another member of staff.  She didn’t even sit down in the seat I was in, she just didn’t want me there. It may sound petty, but its all building up. Thank goodness we made our connecting flight.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-27;" | On my outbound flight (Kuantan - KL - London), my connecting flight from KL to London was delayed by almost 2 hours, - and when I did get on the flight from KL to London MH2, the charger at my seat was broken, the table and near window had coffee stains and there was no water on board. On my return flight (London - KL - Kuantan), my connecting flight from KL to Kuantan was delayed by almost 4 hours (only when asked did they give a breakfast voucher with no written value, while checking at the restaurant, was informed the value was only RM13, balance needed to topped up by myself). When attempting to check in online, I was unable to select any seat. This is the only airline when I tried to check in online had no option to choose the seat, all the other seats were occupied.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-27;" |  London to Kuala Lumpur. Customer service check-in excellent and efficient service with a friendly smile. I don't think Malaysia airlines have a random upgrade pick, I think you have to earn it somehow. Plane crew welcoming and friendly. After the long haul flight, there wasn't many crew saying good bye. I think they were tired and not very happy, then again, who would be if you have to serve a plane load of passengers. Overall, on economy class, it's what I expected. Food was ok - edible. Seats were comfortable. I didn't even get up once from LHR to KUL.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-21; |  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. I am a disabled passenger flying regularly on business class on Malaysia Airlines. I was humiliated in Sydney recently when I was trying to check in by a rude lady at the counter who loudly inquired what my condition was for her to give me the required wheel chair assistance and wanted supporting documents from me. I have Cerebral palsy and you don't need a doctor to understand that I need assistance. Be that as it may all my documents were uploaded to the system. Even if that was not the case she had no business asking me what my condition was in front of all the others in the line. I wrote to the customer care people at the airline and they initially agreed that this has happened but that it was done to help me. Later the story changed and they deny anything happened. I understand that there will always be the rude and arrogant employee who will treat customers badly. However the airline denying that such an incident happened is unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-19;" | We had a seat on the upper deck of the A380 flying from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. We were really surprised by the incredible legroom offered on the upper deck, as well as a storage space beside the window on the economy class! The whole flight was very comfortable and relaxing to the extent that I was a bit reluctant to leave the plane. Some of the crews were very warm and welcoming but some were just average (not rude but not particularly warm and friendly as well). To comment objectively, the food served was better than average, but not what I had expected. However, the pizza served one hour before landing and it was surprisingly delicious. They offered us a drink very frequently, about 5 times throughout the whole flight and of course, you need not wait for them to offer you as you can always ask for one. The IFE was decent, with some new movies like Infinity War etc. However, the IFE feels a bit dated (compared to the newer ones on their A350) and there are no games to play as well. Overall, it was a very positive experience with Malaysia Airlines and I will fly with them again in the future.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-19;" |  Delhi to Kuala Lumpur. The hospitality of the Malaysian Airlines is amazing. One of the crew members on board on 12th August, 2018 (MH191) had made my journey and overall trip so easy and comforting by sharing his valuable knowledge and suggestions about Malaysia as a country, its people and culture.! He made sure to serve and treat us remarkably well. All the crew members were good in terms of service as well.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-17;" |  We flew from Adelaide to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur. Very disappointing to find business class is now nowhere near as good as it used to be. The business class cabin was two thirds empty. No champagne is offered on boarding with a flight attendant saying ""this is not allowed until we're in the air"". This is out of step with most other airlines especially MH's One World partners. The service was just satisfactory with the crew doing the bare minimum. The one toilet in business class was not cleaned throughout the flight and was disgusting by the time we arrived in KL. The food was just awful. We ""booked the cook"" online, my beef ribs were a fatty, gristly mess which was inedible. The seating is OK provided you get the larger version with more space and storage, which the adjoining seat doesn't have making it feel cramped. Movies and TV shows are heavily censored to the point of being ridiculous. Staff in the lounge at KL are at best indifferent. The bar has been hidden away in a separate room near the entrance with no comfortable seating. We were left standing at the desk to get towels for the showers with no staff in sight. Eventually someone appeared and we had to hand over our boarding passes to get a threadbare towel. Your pass is returned when you return the towel. What a joke. We won't be flying with them again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-08-14;" |  My wife and I were flying back from Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur yesterday 12/8/2018. We were flying economy on MH767 at 19:35 local time. The ground staff informed us that we would be unable to fly as my wife (an Indonesian citizen) did not have an on-fly ticket. We explained that we had made this entry several times without having to have such a ticket and was there any alternative, such as a passenger waiver form, as our flight was leaving very soon. The representative became increasingly rude in his manner.  I was upset with this man's total lack of empathy or professionalism in a time of high stress. He found our situation amusing. Up until now I have been extremely happy with Malaysia Airlines services and professionalism. Maybe MH should look a little more closely at their employee supervision?";NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2018-08-12;" |  Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur on A330-300 and B737-800, respectively. Checked in on-line to access lounge in Bangkok early. Uses good lounges in Bangkok, I tried JAL, Cathay, and Miracle. Airline skirmished by strict non-alcohol policy for short flights, and at times, FA’s confiscate people who bring their own drinks/beer on board. Very bad policy that undermines the airline – it is hypocrisy / double moral as they serve alcohol on all longer flights. Very inconstant policy and attitude de facto depends on individual FA’s interpretation also (some are flexible, others are straight). Arrived KLIA late evening and got some sleep in the Golden lounge nap area. Excellent lounges offered in KLIA, dynamic, proactive, young staff. Onboard, IFE is fine. Headphones are of poor quality. Individual screens. Next day continuing to Saigon without any negative remarks: Full flight, good IFE, special meal delivered, arrived on time, airbridge gate boarding and disembarkation in all four instances. Details shows that MH is on the rise: signature bread offered, high quality plastic cutlery is given out on economy class (the best and strongest plastic cutlery that I have ever seen). Special meals accommodated and served to perfection. Cheap ticket which rendered extremely high value for money with an FFP elite status in hand. Got a 50 kg baggage allowance even in economy.";POSITIVE

Appeared to be a long wait for departure. Once we were flying, everything good. Crew friendly, peanuts and juice handed out. Short flights, about one hour.Planes clean, no in flight entertainment. Was pleasantly surprised, better than expected.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-30;" |  Sydney to London via Kuala Lumpur. I bought a return business class with MAS last year for trip with my family to Sydney Australia. The problems started with our inability to utilise the on-demand dining service due to an error on their website which we were told was due to a system upgrade. As regular fliers we chalked this down to one of those things that every company goes through and didn't think more if it. On my return flight, I again went to check in online and use the service but again online check-in and dine on demand was unavailable. Again thought nothing of it until I arrived at Sydney airport. Not only did I arrive to a closed check-in counter with no ground staff available. I was told (eventually by Sydney airport staff) that the flight time had been changed and clearly I had not been notified despite MAS having my mobile and email address. Attempts to contact MAS customer service were useless and I eventually had to purchase a 1 way ticket on the day with QR in order to get back home on time. I raised a complaint via MAS customer centre only to be kept on hold for long periods of time and I was repeatedly told that I may not have been informed of the flight change time due to what became the infamous ""system upgrade"" and the excessive wait times were due to my record not being found due to the ""system upgrade"". I have made repeated attempts to contact MAS customer service and management team for over a year to no avail. The most I have received is a luke warm ""we are looking into it message"" from a customer service agent. Customer Service is poor to say the least.  For the money their premium tickets cost, there is far much better value for money from other airlines.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-30;" | Flew Malaysia Airlines from Phuket to London via Kuala Lumpur. Awful experience, awful customer service. They emailed me after I had departed for the airport to say that my flight had been brought forward a few hours. How can they possible leave it so late and expect me to arrive in time? Not even a phone call. Actually, they didn't move the flight forward - they cancelled my original flight and decided to put me on an earlier one. I then had problems with seats, food and so on. My complaint took more than 6 weeks before I received a totally inadequate reply. Never using them again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-29;" |  Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. I requested a cup of water and the cabin crew told me that all cabin crew are busy preparing food, therefore no one is able to get me a cup of water. Furthermore, she asked me to turn off the service light above me. My experience with Malaysia Airline was unexpectedly disappointed.  For the price I paid, I should not be getting the service of a budget airline.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-26;" |  Jakarta Terminal 3 to Kuala Lumpur. the check-in service was fast and the ground staff was very helpful to accommodate my request to send my baggage directly to Singapore although i have a 9 hr lay over in Kuala Lumpur. The flight was delayed for more than an hour which led for me missing my shuttle service to my hotel in Kuala Lumpur. Most of the cabin staff were very good. The cabin cleanliness was okay but the table and the IFE was smudged with dirt. The food was okay but beverages were very limited, they do not serve alcohol in this route. ";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-26;" |  Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. flight was delayed for almost an hour and it wasn't handled properly by the ground staff. for this flight, only peanuts and juice was served. Such a disappointment for an airline like Malaysian Airlines to serve only that.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-24;" |  The flight from Kuala Lumpur to Hyderabad (Jul 8th, 21:40) was announced canceled just at the moment we should be boarding (20:40).  We were stuck inside at the Transfer Counter where it has taken about 2 hours or more to get our voucher for hotel stay that night. Worst part was that the shuttle to hotel that was about to start at 12 AM started around 1:15 AM. They waited for an hour at the airport for other passengers. The kids were very tired and when we reached the hotel, it was almost 2:20 AM. We hardly had any sleep. And had to get up by 5 AM to rush back by 6 AM shuttle to airport. It was better to stay back at the airport rather be awake all night, waiting in the shuttle for an hour and travelling back and forth to the hotel 1 hour each way.  We opted for vegetarian meal and the food was worst.  And for vegetarians, there are not many options at the airport though the airline gave vouchers. It was a bad experience.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-24;" |  Hong Kong to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur.  All 4 flights had delays over an hour even for the short KUL-SIN sectors. KUL-HKG / HKG-KUL sector was both over 3 hours delayed and had me arrive at HKG past 2am! Not only would I miss the train but had me took a very expensive cab ride home to HK Island.  As for the hard product, dont get me started with that ageing 737 where J really feel like Premium Economy.  On the bright side, kudos to the crew, it was hard to fault them.";NEGATIVE

The cabin design was nice and comfortable, the pillow was small with purple color blanket. Cabin crews were pretty friendly on board.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-23;" |  London to Kota Kinabalu via Kuala Lumpur. I've flown business class on MH regionally and domestic six times in the past 2 years and been very happy (apart from the no alcohol policy), so decided to book this long haul business class flight. MH3 LHR-KUL had a creeping delay which ended up at 5 hours 50 mins late. New onboard business product on A350 is very cramped and a big disappointment. While in Sabah MH reservations removed my return booking from their system which caused me problems and humiliation at check in at Kota Kinalablu and again at KL transfer desk (30mins plus 45mins), as they couldn't get my booking back to be live on their system to issue boarding passes. When we did eventually get on the flights we didn't have the seats we'd selected. I submitted a complaint 20 June and still not had any response 1 month later. Shockingly poor service to a bus class pax and OneWorld Sapphire card holder. They seem to be ignoring their legal obligations to pay delay compensation for an EU originating flight.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-22;" |  Flew Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok via Kuala Lumpur on their ageing B737’s on 21st July 2018. Check-in in SGN was a breeze as usual – I always get the feeling that they just are waiting for me at the counter. This time there were 6 Biz-pax in front of me, but they spotted me as I apparently travelled without inscribed luggage. Thus I was picked aside by the MH-manager who personally checked me in and changed my seats without even asking: he just by his own reassigned me other seats – at first I did not discover – but then later while in the lounge: I checked the aircraft’s configuration: he had given me other, better seats, much appreciated. It took him two Minutes at the counter to issue BPs throughout. I) was granted 50 kg luyggage that I did not use. They respect other Oneworld elite travellers and gave me the earned privileges to “their” SGN-lounge – they use Apricot, a 3rd-party lounge of good quality with excellent views of the tarmac. That lounge improves day by day, I really like the effort. Had some stuff printed out from the Lounge’s business-centre within Minutes. However, the amazing regional “Golden-lounge” in KLIA is even better, inc. sparkling wines and domesticated buffet with hot dishes. One senior staff helped me to make a complicated rebooking and spent over 1 hour for me and eventually we succeeded for a modest ticket change fee. well done. First flight on time – second flight delayed 45 Minutes waiting on the tarmac. On board the FAs are good – even in economy. Special meal pre-ordered and effectuated to perfection. Flights on time – have neither had serious delays nor luggage problem with this airline. Thus, at times when I read several of the reviews in this forum I cannot recognise that it’s the same airline. IFE fair/good on 2nd leg but lacking on 1st leg. Seats OK and spacious for economy. MH are opting their game. However, the lack of beer or wines served onboard on short and medium-haul flights are a big minus that put the airline at max. 4 stars out of 5.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-22; |  Flight was supposed to be at 11:45am on 21/7/18. We were told at approximately 10:32am that the flight was “retimed” (fancy way of saying “delayed” I suppose) to 1:40pm. Just under 2 hours. It is now 2:49pm and I have been sitting in the aircraft for the last 1.5 hours and it hasn’t moved. No concession of any sort given to passengers. You say it’s an under two hour delay but in actual fact it is more than 3 hours. This is very frustrating and shame on you for allowing such delays like this. To make matters worse you don’t provide ear phones for us to watch movies. We can’t order drinks because it’s a short flight apparently. Overall a bad experience.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-22;" |  Singapore to Kuala Lumpur. I took MH606 on 21 Jul and there was a flight delay of more than 2 hours. It was known on Malaysia airlines website that meals compensation should be provided if delay exceeds 2 hours. However, meal vouchers was not given automatically until I asked for it. The officer claim compensation only provided if delay more than 2 hours but finally gave me the meal vouchers. There were many people in the line who queued for 45min and receive nothing. MH should provide compensation automatically to passengers inconvenience without people asking for it. This is even so especially compensation note was published officially on the website.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-21;" |  Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City via Kuala Lumpur on their ageing B737’s on 20th July 2018. Both flights almost full in both classes. First flight delayed 30 Minutes (well announced!), next flight on time. Check-in in Phnom Penh was tedious with an annoying junior 3rd part staff. He wanted to force me to inscribe 1 of 2 pieces of hand-luggage which I tried to refuse and eventually succeeded. There is only 1½ hour check-in time in Phnom Penh which is far too little for full flights like this. As the only Oneworld Airline in the Airport, the staff do not allow you to use your check-in online boarding cards – just waste of time as you have to go through all the check in formalities in Airport anyway. Lounge granted is Plaza Premium, a nicely designed and furbished lounge, but with residing food and drink offerings. Their Bakery is closed. The amazing “Golden-lounge” in KLIA main terminal is nice and spacious. On board FAs are professional and kind. Seat selection and special meals are all free when ticket is purchased on their website. I ordered seafood meal and it was fine on both legs. I tasted other offerings from the menu as well. IFE systems good with touch screens. The big classic business class chairs are extremely nice - better than new lie flat seats. No alcoholic drinks offered. 2 months ago they stopped stand-by options to take earlier flight – a clear service deterioration. Ticket shamelessly cheap but was also purchased 6 months earlier at a sale – when purchased so early the risk of pricey changes/cancellations increase a lot.";POSITIVE

Check in was efficient around 20 minutes in senai airport. Departed on time. First sector was in an old B737 with no ife, only overhead screen. Peanut and orange juice were served. Arrived on time in KLIA and i made to my next gate for next flight. Boarding was fast, flight around 75% full and i was in their new B737-800 with PTV. PTV was slow, but full of content. As expected, flight went very well with hot meals served as dinner. Made it to KCH on time, my luggage were not damaged and intact. It was a good flight.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-11;" |  Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia Airlines use a B737 which is not a comfortable jet for a 5.5 hour flight. The queue for the toilet gets long as in Y class they are located at the end of the aircraft. Boarding was handled very well by ground staff in PER. The aircraft was clean but dated. Seats were narrow and seat pitch on the B737 is a measly 30 inches. IFE was okay but the sound was scratchy over the headphones, despite trying a different pair. The food portions were tasty but really small. The flight from Perth leaves at 350pm and they serve you a full meal at that time. Why not wait for actual dinner time and serve the hot meal before landing? Alcohol was not offered readily and they don't get that you should have a drink WITH your meal and not after your meal. In one half of the aircraft, the FA was handing out meals with no drinks on her trolley. No hot drinks for most of the flight as there was turbulence half way through the flight but the seat belt sign was then left on for the remainder of the time. FA's were helpful and efficient but were not friendly in anyway. Overall, an average, unremarkable experience.";POSITIVE

From the check-in and baggage, it was quite effortless as there are check-in machines where passengers can check-in independently and print baggage tag directly. But, passengers still required to queue to the counter to drop the baggage. The flight was quite on time, but in-flight experience was just fine. Since it is a short-haul flight, passengers were just given peanuts and orange juice for snacks.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-07-02;" | Flew SGN-KUL-PNH on their ageing B737’s 1st of July 2018. Check-in in SGN was a breeze as usual – I always get the feeling that they just are waiting for me at the counter. It took them < 2 Minutes at the counter to process me. Ticket purchased under a campaign for the price resembling that of an economy class ticket. Lounge granted in Saigon is called Apricot, a 3rd-party lounge of good quality. I could have saved ½-1 day of time if I’d taken a direct flight SGN-PNH. However, I gladly take the detour from Saigon over Kuala Lumpur to enjoy the business class privileges, including the amazing “Golden-lounges” in KLIA. On time. 40 kg of checked-in luggage is included in business class (plus some 20 kg in addition from Oneworld Emerald privileges). Luggage handled correctly, expedite, and with care. On board the FAs are professional and kind. Seat selection and special meals are all free when purchased on their website. I ordered Seafood-meal and it was OK (not excellent) and delivered smoothly. The remaining food provision for the cabin was also good, menu-cards with 3 hot options were given to all 16 passengers on business class (that cabin was full, economy only half). I had a grilled red snapper as an additional dish. Staff were proactive and in a sparkling good mood. IFE systems good with touch screens on the individual Monitors. More important is these gorgeous, classic huge, well-bolstered business class chairs that furbish the biz-class cabin. They are so nice and in my view better than new lie flat seats. Onboard, they also provide most of the immigration forms to fill prior to landing in PNH, which saves time. No alcoholic drinks offered thus I bought a beer from Airport which they allowed (or ignored?) me to consume on board. Have never had any issues with Malaysia Airlines, including ticket changes, refunds, luggage, and their impressive punctuality. For the price that I paid it would have been a pure 10/10 score but I need to deduct a point for the limited drink offering. I even got a substantial amount of miles and Q-credits to my Qatar Airways frequent flyer programme.";POSITIVE

There were only 6 counters for Malaysia Airlines(only 5 counters for economy class), but 12 counters for Qatar Airways in the same row. Perhaps Malaysia Airlines can increase the number of check in counters in Seoul Airport to increase the efficiency of luggage check in process. I waited for more than an hour to check in my luggage. The seat was comfortable and the legroom is big enough for me to stretch my legs. The cabin staff was very friendly. The breakfast(American breakfast) provided is nice, but the portion is not enough for me. The in flight entertainment was awesome and had a lot of movies and musics.";POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2018-06-19;" |  Sydney to Dhaka via Kuala Lumpur. Malaysian Airlines cancelled and rescheduled all four of my flights going to Dhaka via Kuala Lumpur and back due to technical problems. The worst part though was not the cancellation, but the way they dealt with it. I was provided no compensation for the four delayed flights, even though it cost me an additional one night of hotel booking as well as the loss of a night I had originally booked in a hotel. For the return cancellations, I received no notification until the day of departure, even though the cancellation was known 5 days in advance. I happened to go to my online booking and to my surprise saw that the return date had changed. Why did they not inform us beforehand? Other passengers on the flight did not know about it in advance, and I met two passengers who only found out when they had reached the airport. - My luggage arrived dented and with a broken wheel, but Malaysian Airlines indicated it does not compensate for this either. It took 2 weeks for Malaysian Airlines to get back to my complaint, with a message saying I will receive no compensation under ""Article 10.01"" of ""Conditions of Carriage"". And it turns out the person didn't even read my complaint or check the flight history, because it acknowledged only one of my four cancelled flights. Malaysian Airlines staff on the phone and at the airports were unhelpful, saying they cannot do anything for me - not even allowing me to change my seat, having lost my original selection due to the rescheduling. - They did not indicate the reason for the first two cancellations, only the return cancellations - very unprofessional. The online booking system rejected two credit cards, a call with my bank indicated their online system was at fault, and ran into similar issues booking by phone - before a umptieth time it finally went through.  I've had quite a few cancellations before, that was not the issue, but this is the worst I have been treated as a passenger by any airline. The way it was handled - not responding or acknowledging my complaint, not even reading it and realizing there were 4 not 1 cancellations, and all the other things which went wrong indicating that the airline is unprofessional. It made me feel like I was nothing but a number in their system and they don't care at all about their passengers.";NEGATIVE

Flight was only about 60% full, which contributed to the sense of well-being. The interior was laid out in calming earth-tone shades of brown, with slightly worn faux leather seats. IFE touch screen on seatbacks, but bring your own headphones. I have always found the B737 touchscreens to be laggy and slow, and this was no different. Legroom was adequate. After departure, a quick hot meal was served (kung po chicken noodle) with bottled water. Crew were friendly and engaged throughout, helping a mother with a young baby rather than ignoring her. Overall, a pleasant short flight.";POSITIVE

Business class from my view was great, dimmed light and all, but economy was the worst, the whole long midnight flight was with the light on, it was so bright I couldn't sleep. The manager, a lady stewardess was so scary, she was so loud and rude, the lady sat next to me put her phone on airplane mode and she was (I believe) browsing her photos in her album, and this manager shouted at her to put it off and said, ""I say off, not airplane mode"" to her a few times, my neighbour looked korean and I think her English wasn't that good, but as a stewardess you don't have to shout so many times.

They sent me a generic letter that according to them the damages were minor. I wrote back to them as the generic letter they sent me did not correspond to the letter of complaint I had sent them, they didn't even bother to respond.

It is only when someone challenges me while I am still seated did I realise that the seat had been double assigned. As I am travelling with a companion we would like to be seated together. However, the upgraded passenger insists on the ""paid upgraded seat"" with rising their voice demanding the right to his paid seat from the ground staff.

When I rang for service the flight attendants response was a yes as if why are you bothering us. West Coast of Australia and I was informed no more service as the bar in now closed. With over 4 hours of flight this is not normal.  Snack time and again I got no beverage service - passengers received an ice cream. Not me. Part 2 Delayed.

A light snack was served, consisting of bottled water, croissant sandwich and muffin, but hot drinks were not offered.

malaysia-airlines;2018-05-19;" | Pros: 1) Frequent, direct flights for the LHR-KUL route 2) Competitive prices for their Economy Promo seats compared to the Economy Smart/Premium and other airlines with a 30 kg check-in baggage (multiple bags) allowance included. These however come with limitations (see below). Cons: 1) Travellers booked on Economy Promo seats, on top of having limited choices for their times/dates for flying and having to book a non-changeable/refundable trip early, will not be allowed the option to select their preferred seat 24-48 hours during the online check-in process as seat allocations are automatic and controlled by the airport airline counters (particularly for the KUL-LHR leg). This means that frequent, solo travellers with seat preferences or travellers in groups/families are inconvenienced by having to request for a change of seat at the airport counter during the 2 hour window prior to boarding on the day of their flight, or will have to pay more to select their seat of choice during the booking process (which reduces the difference from the discount of booking a Economy Promo seat in the first place). This contrasts to what other airlines are offering, I found the majority of other airlines still provide a complimentary seat selection upon checking in 24 hours prior (with 23-30 kg baggage allowance). 2) The cost of the MHUpgrade to Business Class after booking an Economy seat amounts to more than purchasing a Business Smart seat early on in the first place. I was offered an MHUpgrade for both legs of my most recent flight in May 2018, but found that the minimum amount required to start a bid was a hundred pounds more than the original price to book a Business Smart seat, excluding the price of the original cost of the ticket paid. This marketing strategy made no sense to me. 3) Frequent flyers are not allowed to utilise their miles/points to pay for seat selections or upgrades on top of paying cash for seat tickets. This further limits the usefulness of accrued loyalty points with this particular airline, which requires a significant amount of points for free flight ticket redemption (based on a normal price ticket and not applicable for Promo fares). 4) The recent change from the Airbus A380 (with the possibility of selecting an Economy seat on the quieter upper deck section with a comfortable 2-4-2 configuration) to the new Airbus A350-900 with a 3-3-3 configuration with smaller seats/legroom as well as cramped and reduced number of toilets located at the far end of each section of the economy aisles (long way to walk from the kids bassinet seats up front). 5) Fly-from-Heathrow only, which means those who are based further up north of England may need to allocate 3-4 hours prior for travelling down to Heathrow. This may negate the time saved when using a direct flight vs. using other alternative airlines with connecting flights. Overall, Despite using Malaysia Airlines exclusively over the last 10 years for this particular route. its increasing disadvantages and discouraging airline loyalty programme provides serious reconsideration in continuing the use of this airline. My recent encounters with the customer service team based in Malaysia over technical difficulties/issues during my online check-in process last September 2017 and their lack of interest/feedback following their own teams' advice over the counter to submit an online complaint has also allowed me to think twice now before booking with this airline in the future.";NEGATIVE

Also, no personal TVs, only the kind that come down from the ceiling. This is absolutely ridiculous for anything that is dared to be called ""business class"" on any airline, and that's a lot coming from someone who routinely flies terrible airlines based out of the US.

I filed a claim to get a refund for the costs I incurred in early March. I did not hear anything from them for 4 weeks. Then I tried to email the person who had replied to my claim. The person doesn't seem to work there anymore, as the email was returned immediately. All email addresses provided on Malaysia Airlines website don't work. The phone number provided for mishandled lugagge works, but in a dozen attempts I have never reached anyone. Then I called the general number. They said they would forward me. I'm in the line for about 5 minutes and then I'm kicked out. This happened three times. I tried to go through the website again, but all I get is a confirmation of receipt for my claim, but nobody seems to process the case after that. Nobody seems to be responsible for anything, nobody can be reached, wrong email addresses, numbers under which you can't reach anyone. It's an absolute mess. I find it hard to find the right words to describe the level of incompetence. I have spent so much time on the phone trying to resolve the case. The phone bill probably already exceeds what I could've hoped for as a refund for the costs I incurred. I will never fly with this airline again.";NEGATIVE

It can be further improved, however with the better inflight entertainment system. The On Demand service offered was kind of dated and the IFE system for the whole cabin actually stopped functioning in the third half of the flight. I hope to see some refurbishment of A380 cabin in the near future in order for the airlines to stay competitive. I was seated at the Upper Deck of Economy Cabin. Aircraft deployed (9M-MND) was a little dated with visible masking tape taped on the interior flight equipment (ie. Lavatory & Cabin). The tray table was dirty and poorly maintained at its hygiene standard. Inflight catering offered was exceptionally good. I opted for the beef with kimchi rice, the portion was generous but the entree and dessert could be further improved. Cake was served as dessert but it was way too sweet!

Some people already had tags with them but there weren't any machines in the terminal to print them out - so we asked for assistance. The Malaysia Airlines assistant was alone and crawling under requests, she advised we only had to queue but was not convincing at all in her advice. During the flight, my boyfriend and I were instructed in a very directive way to sit down (whilst stretching our legs at the back of the flight because the back of the plane was for crew only). This was pretty strange as every other flight we've ever flown has allowed people to walk up and down and stretch their legs if needed even at the back of the plane. The thing that was most off-putting was the way we were spoken to (which I'd describe as being outright rude). We incurred an hours delay for take off on the 1st leg and 30 min on the return leg. We had breakfast (omelette, fruit juice, fruits and yogurt) at 1pm KL time when we expected lunch. We were also told that we had no option, as they were out of any other options. Other passengers also complained about this fact. After breakfast I went to ask for some peanuts, but I was told ""No, later"" by one of the stewardesses - whom I'm assuming was the Chief Stewardess. First of all, we did not have a choice for ""lunch"" and then to be declined a little snack after, when MAS fares are higher than other carriers (who also serve more food) is disappointing. We found the cabin crew to be really direct and lacked good customer service skills. It's a shame as we've flown with MAS before and have always thought that they were a great airline. We're more than disappointed flying with them this time around from LHR-KUL and back again. The plane was a A350, KL0004 on Wednesday April 12th 2018 departing 09.50 AM from KL to LHR We have decided never to fly with MAS again. The experience is a disappointment and truly a shame for such an airline company with high potential.

Always easy to make changes with Malaysia Airlines. I love these big, thickly bolstered seats in the 737’s. Cabin crew were professional and very friendly. Special meal pre-ordered and given. Tried also one of their three options of hot food from the menu cards given to all passengers in business class. Would have appreciated a glass of wine, but not even a simple beer could be provided. Hate this imposing alcohol ban on a prestigious airline – that put them into same category as Egypt Air, PIA, Saudia Arabian, and alike. They have lost a lot of passengers due to that policy though they may also have gained a few. The airline seems to be on its rise and the new lounges in KLIA are impressive and nice.

Alcohol was served after takeoff and I was regularly checked for a refill if needed.

I have seen a lot of hype about the ""awesome"" A350 cabin. Don‘t fall for it. Malaysia Airlines has modelled its economy cabin for maximum revenue not passenger comfort. Cabin crew - like some planes they looked worn out and tired. Robotic and clearly intent on performing their work to maximise their non-passenger contact and sleeping time. Rushed through cabin not giving opportunity to ask for service. No pleasantness or genuine smiles. Cabin was left completely unattended for part of flight and with only one crew for much of flight. No cabin service. Help yourself from galley. Only water and biscuits available. Some very irritating behaviour: male crew especially. I find it offensive to be served by someone who thinks he is on a stage in the role of a drag queen. Seat belt sign switched on during meal service but no turbulence. Hot drink service suspended. You can get a hot drink after your meal but not with it. Says it all about quality of MAS today. Entertainment system broke down late into flight. Toilets very small and not cleaned often enough (but then you can't clean a toilet if you are sleeping). Food OK. Not a word from the Captain for whole of flight.

After a long process of establishing my identity, the reply came back- please complain this to the cabin crew. I had complained to the cabin crew who asked me to complain to Customer Services. When I take it up with Customer Services, they ask me to complain to the Cabin Crew. This is a ridiculous situation of passing the buck.";NEGATIVE

There was an old lady who appeared to be lost. She was wondering up and down the aisles looking for her seat. She could not remember where it was. I did not see staff helping her or re-seating her to somewhere near the galley where they could keep an eye on her. Later I saw her trying to open the toilet door. I had to help her open the door.  In my opinion, I do not think it is a satisfactory situation of passenger care. ";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-02-27;" | Red eye flight Kuala Lumpur - Sydney, 16 Feb, seat 16A, upper deck. Golden Lounge was undergoing renovation so we were directed to the regional lounge which was small and cramped and very hot. Boarding gate was woefully inadequate for a large aircraft. There was no aerobridge to the upper floor so we climbed the stairs inside the plane which would not work well for people with mobility problems. The cabin was dated and scruffy and about 30% occupied. Staff were disinterested in their passengers and were in a hurry to get the dinner service over. No menus were offered until I asked. Drinks were given out begrudgingly. Once dinner was over, no offer of dessert instead the table linen was whisked away. Lights out and I turned down the bed which proved hard and uncomfortable. The gaps in the seat made it hard to sleep on despite the thin mattress given out. Breakfast was offered and my choice was not available despite it being a relatively empty cabin. I had the Chinese dim sum which was dry and overcooked. I used my Enrich miles to upgrade my ticket but based on what I received, I would not purchase a Business class ticket with this carrier. Using the Enrich miles was also difficult as they make it almost impossible to upgrade due to all sorts of conditions. Staff were efficient but not friendly and never smiled.";NEGATIVE

This is a nice touch but it just slows people down. Once on board, everything worked well. Staff were efficient and responded to requests quite promptly but were clearly disinterested in their passengers and never smiled once during the flight. I wonder if the morale of Malaysia Airlines cabin crew is deteriorating? The food was good and adequate but the in flight entertainment is not extensive. The flight left and arrived bang on time. Uneventful and everything went off well.";POSITIVE

Passengers who had connecting flights, or meetings begged the staff at the MH transit counter to put them on a Singapore Airlines code sharing flight which was refused. I was lucky enough that I had 4hr layover in Kuala Lumpur. Flight to KL was on a rather tired looking Boeing 737. FA's were rather robotic and not overly friendly. Golden Lounge in KL was still under renovation despite different information given on the MH website claiming that it opened on the 20th  February. Replacement lounge shockingly basic. Service on the long flight was similar as on the short flight. Food and seat was decent. Flight arrived on time, IFE poor. MH has been constantly on the decline over the last few years, but this was the new low point due to the handling with the delay, and the not very friendly staff.";NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2018-01-28;" | I was due to travel an 8hr flight with my wife and 20 month old daughter from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur at 3.15pm then have a few hours layover in KL followed by a 3hr flight to Colombo. We were informed that this flight was cancelled and rescheduled at the airport and asked to line up as normal at the check in counter (which took 1hr) just to be told to come back at 9am the next day for the rescheduled flight. There were no staff to inform us of the reasons why the flight was rescheduled to anxious passengers lining up. We were told to call the Malaysia Airlines number to find out the flight info (they were not going to contact us). I called the number and was informed that not only was it going to be a 9am flight (which we particularly didn't want due to having a 20 month old up all day on a plane) but we would also now have a 9hr layover in KL (compared to the original 3hr layover). They stated that they would provide accommodation and meals for the layover and we would be met by an attendant when we arrived in Malaysia. Further, they did not send the new flight details until I called up and requested them. So we got to the airport the next day at 9am and checked in. But due to a ""comment"" on the online system they couldn't print out my wife's connection boarding pass so we would have to get that from KL. Then the flight was not only delayed by 2hrs but we also had to be bussed to the aircraft which was in a disgusting condition. Dirty floor, toilets etc. It was obviously thrown together at last minute. The explanation for the delay was that the catering was late (ironically the food was also the worst I have ever had on an airline). We also had to fight to get the baby meals we requested for our daughter. When we arrived in KL, no one was there to met us and they had not orgainsed the accommodation, which had to be organised by staff at the transfer desk who didn't seem to know what was going on. Then the group (others who were in our position) that had to be accomdated was not escorted to the hotel but just given directions. They had also forgotten to include a meals allowance which I had to get the hotel to follow up on. Additionally, the boarding procedures were unbelievably disordered, passengers were not called up by seat area and instead allowed to pile onto the plane creating chaos within the aircraft. On board the plane we found that most of the attendants seemed annoyed when passengers asked them for assistance and some were overtly rude. In sum, minimal explanations, no financial reimbursement, no benefits, poor service, communication and organisation. This was an awful experience and I won't be flying with them again. I understand that sometimes flights have to be rescheduled but the lack of professionalism in its management was unbelievable! ";NEGATIVE

Ticket bought on-line MHs website very cheap. PNH-airport: check-in was slow and opens only 2 hours prior departure in 3 lanes – not enough! It took 30 minutes to check me in as I was proceeding from SGN to Africa on other OneWorld tickets and needed BP and luggage checked throughout. That created a lot of confusion as nobody in the Airport knew about these destinations and were internally disagreeing on the rules and thus hesitating to allow me to check-in the whole way. Eventually they – somehow hesitant – agreed. A problem is that 3rd party agents are doing the check-in and they are neither very professional nor quick nor able to take any decision. Onboard, spacious seats give. Special meal was given only on the 2nd leg. Food was fine and delicious, menu cards were given out and three options of hot food. Pre-departure drinks offered, no alcoholic offered, but the lounges they offer at KLIA and in PNH have plenty. Golden Lounge (“Regional”, at main terminal) have 2 sparkling wines, one cava and one champagne. The cava is the best despite likely being four times cheaper than the champagne. FAs onboard were all in a good mood, pro-active, courteous and observant. Faultless travels, punctual, luggage generous and well handled. Special meal noted (on one leg) and elite status respected.";POSITIVE

We have travelled to Malaysia with MH more often than I would care to remember and we have always been very happy with the service provided. However, sadly not on this occasion, we were very disappointed. The standard has certainly dropped. FA gave us the impression that they would rather be somewhere else even though they try hard to be pleasant. I pre-ordered our meal through ""book the cook"" and the meal was of poor standard and the menu has been reduced to only four choices and to rub salt into the wound, I was only given a spoon with my meal. The wine at meal time was only served on request. The return journey to Sydney was no better. Malaysia is our favourite destination and we hope to visit Malaysia as often as we can but next time it will be with SIA. The only bright aspect of our flight was the use of the QANTAS Lounge.

I have tried my best to support Malaysia Airlines over the past few years and found they were always good despite their troubles and cutbacks but I must admit this lastest business class trip was extremely disappointing and really puts their standing into doubt. The first thing I noticed is that their system no longer allows you to select a seat using online check-in. Surely this helps the check in process at the airport as it’s 1 less thing for check-in staff to have to do. I know they have removed alcohol from their shorter flights and this needed to be addressed as some years ago you were offered alcohol on a 1 hour domestic flight at 7.30 in the morning! Obviously ridiculous and unnecessary. But this was a mid afternoon international business class flight, I don’t intend getting completely drunk on a flight but it is nice to have a wine with dinner on an international flight, especially in business class, this is very disappointing. They seem to be really penny pinching and slowly getting worse and worse, there is little that is endearing me to them any more and so they will no longer be my automatic first choice, they don’t deserve the custom.";NEGATIVE

I had checked in online and printed my boarding pass, and in the end I had the seat I initially choose. Inside of the aircraft was rather clean and tidy, their blanket was nice and cozy and earphones were comfortable to wear. The displayed information regarding the safety instructions is easy to reach. Toilets are very clean as well and the cabin crews on this particular flight were rather pleasant and responded quickly to my request. The flight overall was quiet though there was some turbulence, to be fair this is beyond the airlines control. I unfortunately felt under the weather during the flight and the crews were able to accommodate my requests. A couple of issues which could be improved is that their entertainment system is certainly not the easiest to navigate. I ended up taking out my laptop to work and listen to my own music instead of using their system. The food they provided has fallen below par with the reputation they had, whilst the food is served warm, it certainly lacks flavour. You get what you pay for, the price they offered for this particular trip was competitive enough for me to take it. For a 13 hours plus flight I did have the amenities they promised and did not regret my decision. To summarise, ""Good value for money, but a lot of areas could be improved"".";POSITIVE

Takes me less than 10 minutes to buy a ticket and the price is clear and fixed from beginning till end. At SGN-airport, check-in was quick and perfect. Onboard, recommended by staff to change my seat to get a spacious section to myself, which is a pro-active, positive effort by the FAs. Pre-departure drinks offered. No alcoholic drinks on these short flights, but they normally allow discrete, modest consumption of own supplies. Food menu dished out. 3 hot dishes offered on flights less than 100 minutes. Had a wonderful noddle-prawn dish (mee Siam), which went down with pleasure. Offered sparkling water, and they gave me a full bottle and inserted a lemon boat to beef it up – well done. FA's were courteous and observant. IFE excellent, quality headphone dishes out. Lounge access granted in Saigon (""Apricot"") and in KLIA (""Golden regional""), both lounges of high quality. Basically a 5-star experience, though the ageing aircraft and limitation of drink varieties deduct a little bit on rating. Went on a sales ticket (“End of Year”-promotion) from MH-website and paid only 148 usd for these 2 legs (287 USD/return). Faultless travel - a true gift. The proof is that I spend gladly ½ day travelling this huge deviation between SGN and PNH instead of going direct which takes only 1 hour. Furthermore, I earned a substantial amount of miles to my OneWorld FFP-card, inserted within 6 days.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2018-01-08;" | Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow. Excellent service, food has improved. The staff has been great. They offer friendly attentive service and did many drinks round. During the flight, the passenger in front of me spilled coffee over her shirt. The crew noticed it and swiftly passed her a wet towel. They also responded to an array of unusual drink requests efficiently, all with a smile. I fly frequently between Kuala Lumpur and London. The flight time is 13.5 hours. In the past, Malaysia Airlines tend to serve a hot meal 2 hours after departure, a snack 6 hours after departure, then another hot meal 10 hours departure. As a result, some passengers can feel hungry between the 2 hot meals service. On this occasion, the inflight supervisor announced that they are trialling a new meal service timing. This time the first hot meal was served 2 hour after take-off. The second hot meal was moved forward, being served around 7 or 8 hours after take off. Then, they handed out a snack box for passengers to consume at their leisure. A few hours later, they also handed out packs of peanuts. Passengers didn't feel the hunger and in fact I noted my fellow passengers joked that the airlines keep on feeding them. I like this new service. It also increases the cabin crew service frequency. I also noted the snack box has improved both in terms of quantity and quality. It used to be a pack of nuts plus a slice of cake. Now, it consist of a croissant with meat filling plus a chocolate. For the vegetarian, they get a foccacia filled with ratatouille. The thin blankets have also been replaced with warmer fleece blanket. The food quality has improved. We were served chicken satay with fried rice! Nonetheless, there are still room for improvement to the food, such as in the presentation and introducing healthier salad, as done by Delta Airlines. Overall, the Malaysia Airlines is taking steps to improve the customer experience.";POSITIVE

Once the plane arrived I realized that the plane was so small compared to the one we came with. The IFE wasn’t even updated because on the KL to Jakarta flight there were more movies. The flight wasn’t that bad though. 5 hours later we landed in KL, since our flight was the next day we decided that we should look around KL. The next day our flight was at 6 pm, we woke up had breakfast and did some shopping and then headed to the airport. As the connection was less than 24 hours the checked in bags stayed at the airport. Again the plane was small, but we were not concerned as it was a 2 hr flight. Once we landed we were walking to the conveyer belt when we realized that 3/4 of our bags were at the lost and found. On the tag it said MH725 the correct one and a sticker on top of it with the word Rush and MH711 which is the early morning flight. We were missing our last bag so we checked with the staff about our bag. They checked it in the system and it said file not found.

Special meals accommodated. IFE does not work well but was OK. FA's were professional. Good information from captain. Luggage (3 pieces) arrived smoothly. No alcohol on the short sector.

Maybe I have to choose 7A for my next trip. Anyway it was a very pleasant flight. From KUL to LHR on A380. Cabin was spacious but terribly messy. My seat was full of bread crumbs and dust. It was a flight starting from Malaysia Airlines hub. I could not understand how cabin had been cleaned. Cabin crew was efficient but not so attentive, because of midnight flight? Seat was quite comfortable. But seat topper and quilt were not comfortable at all. One more complaint I was their food. I pre-ordered seafood meal. But all meals I got on both flights, including breakfast before arriving at LHR were the same, the same fish! Incredible! Two flights on the same airline on the same day gave me two totally different impression. I have flown Malaysia Airlines several times  in C class.

malaysia-airlines;2017-12-24;" | London to Sandakan via Kuala Lumpur. I am truly sorry we booked flights with Malaysia Airlines. Please read to make sure you do not make the same mistakes we did. We booked flights for our annual travels and had a very stressful experience, mainly due to the lack of customer service. Our aircraft was delayed from London Heathrow by 4 hours and 15 minutes. We then missed our connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Sandakan. We arrived in Sandakan a total of 9 hours late. Our luggage was lost en route and not returned for 48 hours. Customer services were rude and unwilling to help track the luggage. In their own words it was not their responsibility to help and there was no telephone number for the department who could help. On top of our booking for international flights between UK and Borneo, we added a domestic flight from Sandakan to Kota Kinabalu which cost £40 for two people. Because of the lost luggage and disrupted flights our tours were disrupted and we had to re plan our trip. We needed to rebook the domestic flight but were advised it would cost us £700 (to reschedule a £40 flight). We requested to miss the flight so we could just book flights with another airline but were still told we needed to pay £700. If not they would cancel our flights back to UK automatically. This was a part of the terms and conditions we signed up to apparently. No one from customer service was willing to have a rational discussion about it. To avoid the £700 charge, we actually took the internal flight and then booked flights back to origin (Sandakan) to continue our rescheduled trip. It felt like Malaysian Airlines had actually lost the plot. We spent a day flying when they could have just cancelled the flights and let us fly with another carrier. We never requested a refund so our seats would have just gone empty or been used by other customers at no additional cost to them. The above is a lesson not to block book flights with Malaysia Airlines. If you need to make any minor changes (even if their fault), they will ruthlessly exploit you for cash and leave you in a state of high stress if you allow it to happen. Please make sure you book domestic flights separately which will give you flexibility in case your flights are disrupted. The USB charger in seats our row were all broken, so we couldn't charge our phones for when we arrived in Borneo and needed to call hotel for transfers. The in flight entertainment screen was broken so nothing to watch while stuck on the airrcraft for 18 hours. When asked if I could move seat to one with working screen and USB, I was told no. Legroom was small compared to Thai Airways so the flight was uncomfortable (fair enough, they were Economy tickets meaning I had apparently waivered my human rights anyway). The return flight was 4 hours late. The aircrew were all very nice people and did their best to help passengers. That was appreciated and this review is not to do with them. They are not to blame. Delays and disruption are an everyday part of travelling and I understand that. Having zero customer service and leaving customers stranded without support is not. I won't overestimate Malaysia Airlines again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-12-23;" |  Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow. Early morning check in experience similar to that for REP previously reviewed, it would be so much more pleasing with a raceway system. Priority immigration a misnomer with one manned desk to serve premium passengers for all airlines, not Malaysia Airlines fault but general immigration for non-Malaysians and security would be far less stressful with raceways. As has been previously reported the Golden Wing in the satellite terminal is being modernised. the CIP alternative does not do MH service - limited seating, paper tubs in lieu of plates, plastic cutlery and no toilet facilities other than the disgusting offering on the concourse below. Entry to the departure lounge includes second security check, documentation check followed by direction to the upper lounge. Welcome onboard and directed to the 18 seat forward J cabin which is quite intimate, amenities, headset, menu, mattress, pillow and duvet at each seat - which is far superior to that in the A330s. Welcome soft drink followed by selection of main course for the brunch. My wife had the last Nasi Lemak and the flight attendant appeared genuinely remorseful that I had to take my second option - Spanish omelette. To make amends she returned within five minutes to take my lunch selection - nice touch. Push back about 45 minutes late but my guess is that is technical so that the arrival slot at LHR is on time and avoids fuel wastage holding over Kent. Post brunch there was a selection of both hot and cold snacks on request, as were alcoholic drinks. About four hours before landing the signature satay dish was served followed by the drinks trolley then somewhat bemusingly tables were cleared until about two hours before landing when the second meal was served by the tray rather than by courses. On long daytime flights I try to avoid sleeping in the hope of a decent nights sleep after arrival and am content with a book, the flight map/info (the MH A380 system being one of the best I’ve seen) and watching the passing geography. Something I appreciate about Malaysia Airlines is that I’ve never had my blinds lowered against my wishes. By pure coincidence we used the same hotel at LHR as the crew, we met several of the cabin crew on the night of arrival and the following morning and were recognised and pleasantries exchanged.";POSITIVE

The lounge in REP is used by multiple airlines and is a distinct improvement on the old lounge although poorly sign posted. Once inside it was virtually empty with ample seating and dining areas. it gave a feeling of exclusivity. There was a large selection of hot and cold dishes - not sampled in anticipation of a beef rendang for lunch onboard. A full bar service was available. Boarding was hassle free and the business cabin with the newer seating was half full. Warm welcome onboard, juice, newspaper and menu at seat. Early push back followed by anticipated rendang once airborne. Timely arrival into KUL, where Immigration was packed.

The most annoying is that the airline has discontinued luggage cooperation with most airlines if booked on separate tickets. Thus, I had to struggle in HKG to take my luggage out and check it in again on another carrier. MH policy on no alcohol on stretches under 3 hours is patronising and humiliating. Lounges accessed in SGN and HKG were good. Flight SGN-KUL was good but on the older 737 aircraft. The only remaining MH-lounge in KUL (due to rebuilding of two of their lounges) closes at midnight and do not open until dawn. A third party “CIP lounge” is hired in to fill the gap but it is small and restricted. So had to sleep in a coach in the open terminal area until the real lounge opened at 5 a.m. KUL-HKG was on an A330 which was completely full but service was still top-notch. Special meals were delivered to perfection on all stretches. Additional meal tried out as some were in excess - these were also good. Lounge allowance generous. IFE good. Seat space very good. I was allocated seats next to my son without additional request and did not even have to mention it. A pleasant experience and the few hiccups must be tolerated as the price is very competitive.";POSITIVE

Icalled again on 15th December, one of the supervisors promised that she will go through the recording and get back to me regarding this, but failed to do so.

No back seat screen for IFE nor USB port to charge devices. Seat width and seat pitch is ok for a short haul flight. Seat comes with adjustable headrest. Cabin crew announcement in both English and Bahasa Melayu is clear. Shortly after boarding, meal is served and the choice is between noodle with chicken and fish with rice. I choose the noodles. Food was overheat, portion is small and there were not enough sauce. Overall, an uneventful flight. Immigration at the domestic/international transfer counter at KLIA is a nightmare with 4 counters but only 3 open so advise to allow more time if transiting at KLIA from a domestic destination. Disappointed MH is deploying a Boeing 737-800 NG on a medium haul flight. Aircraft is generally clean and tidy. There is backseat TV screen but no headrest. Comes with pillow, blanket and headset. I was lucky to be seated at the emergency exit row so plenty of seat pitch, however sit width is not that great. Dinner is delayed due to air turbulence. Choice is: beef lasagna & chicken with rice. Choose beef lasagna. Comes with dinner roll, crackers, salad with ham and cheese cake. Broccoli was a little overcook but still looked green. Lasagna was flavourful and enough bolognese sauce. Cabin crew was friendly but none has stood out as an exceptional one. The IFE has quite a good range of genres to choose from, however the backseat TV screen is not so responsive.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-12-12;" | 9 December, MH 764. 08.00 business class counter checkin at KLIA was not totally chaotic but less than impressive. There are many regional departures around this time and it appeared that all desks were operating, however, there was no raceway organisation and passengers were left to choose their queue of choice. On reaching the desk the Malaysian lady was helpful, efficient and personable but had no mechanical support and because her male colleague was busy elsewhere I had to do all the luggage manhandling onto the conveyor. In comparison immigration and security were quickly dealt with. The Regional lounge is in the main concourse and not easily found being located up an escalator above a coffee outlet and not sufficiently signposted. We were greeted on arrival but had considerable difficulty locating two adjoining seats, shortly thereafter there was a mass exodus and by 09.00 we felt we had the lounge to ourselves. The Regional lounge is dry (as are regional flights under 3 hours) but not a problem at that time of day. The breakfast offering, not sampled, was impressive and would compare favourably with first class hotels in the region. Calls are not made in the lounge and the departures board not kept up to date, not sure whose fault that is, suffice to say that at 09.45 the last flight on the board had departed 15 minutes earlier. The rule is to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to departure where there was another perfunctory security check. No Malaysian officials were at the departure lounge but it was spacious and relatively comfortable for a 737 full load. Boarding, once commenced, was by row number from the rear of the plane with J class and senior ffs when they wished. The cabin had 5 customers. A previous Malay national reviewer commented that being greeted and treated onboard was like being taken into the crew’s home and I can’t think of a better description of how the cabin attendant treated us throughout the flight. Juice or water prior to departure with that day’s newspaper in the seat pocket. Menu offered which included fruit starter, bakery and nasi lemak or western breakfast. Pushback on time flight deck briefing on the flight followed by uneventful trip to Siem Reap. The planes are showing their age in the cabin but the 2-2 wide seat arrangement beats the regular European offering of economy 3-3 with the centre seat empty. And the outstanding effort of the crew was what really counts.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-12-11;" |  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. Counter checkin after minimal wait pleasant staff issued tickets for pre-selected seats. Fast track through Immigration using chip technology worked for my wife but rejected me.  MH now use the QF lounge which at 1100 was the usual zoo (not MH fault just too many One World partners use the lounge greatly supplemented by QF Club members travelling in economy, QF should really consider on option whereby J customers get preferential treatment) but quickly thinned out. usual high standard of catering and beverages. Priority boarding worked efficiently, warmly greeted we settled into paired seating - right side alternating with the “throne” seats. I can understand the attitude of single travellers who are “paired” feeling “seen off” when compared with the “thrones”. The cabin was full but the dedicated crew of 4 worked efficiently and with a team spirt showing. Pre take off water or juice, menus already in the seat pocket together with headphones and hard shell amenities kit. Push back early with adequate information flow from the flight deck. Shortly after take off drinks were offered - choice of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages including champagne. The signature satay accompanied the second drinks round followed by lunch, we were seated toward the rear of the cabin and served towards the end but all options were still available - the celebrity chef designed nonya chicken was thigh meat and juicy. Cheese and biscuits were an option after or in lieu of dessert. A selection of ‘small’ dishes including Aussie meat pie were available post lunch until just prior to landing, similarly for those who wished drinks were available throughout though sadly the Sav Blanc ran out. I found the seat comfortable but did not use the lie flat feature, my wife who is vertically challenged would who’ve appreciated a longer leg/foot rest. Arrival in KL as close to schedule as to not matter, quick transfer from satellite to main terminal, immigration officials aplenty and no wait for formalities, luggage on the belt very shortly thereafter - mixed with baggage from the London flight - with priority bags first. It had been a couple of years since last using MH and reading some entries over the past months had me a little concerned about standards but our experience was faultless at SYD, onboard and at KUL.";POSITIVE

I bought a heavily discounted business class ticket from an OTA where I need to change – OTA did not react so I had to contact MAS who did it for me in seconds for a modest fee of 0.53 USD. Check In on-line easy but superfluous if you have luggage. Check-in counter opens only 2 hours before departure for international flight. Loads of people were waiting in PNH as the traffic makes it too risky to count on arrival 2 hours before. Another bad point is the lack of alcohol offering onboard. The aircraft are pretty old and a bit worn though maintained. These 2-3 issues deduct 2 stars from the 10, so 8 is my conclusive score as the rest was superb: Lounges in PNH (Plaza Premium and Golden Lounge, respectively) were great and spacious. Especially the latter has got a huge facelift and has become big, with a bar, more presentable food, nap-areas, 1st class section, etc. Check-in a breeze. Prioritised at gate, at check-in and on board. Ordered special seafood meals delivered to perfection. Other three dishes offered on board. The winner was a delicious “mee Siam” spicy, fried noodle dish. Drinks offered and glass refilled even without request. Luggage delivered quickly. Generous luggage allowance. Boarding and disembarking at airbridges throughout despite being on small aircraft (B-737-800). All flights on time. FFP-Miles instated within a week. Extremely good value for money.";POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2017-11-29;" |  Perth to Kuala Lumpur. Check-in at Perth airport is easy and convenient. A tip is to check-in online through the Malaysia Airlines app or website to avoid the queue at the airport. The aircraft is generally clean and tidy despite it is quite old. There is a USB port to charge your iPhone or iPad and a TV screen and an inflight magazine for inflight entertainment. However, I am surprised that MH would deploy a Boeing 737-800 on a medium haul flight. I have travelled on this sector in the past and they were using Airbus 330-300. I was lucky to be given an emergency exit so I have plenty of extra legroom. There is no headrest in economy class but I fell asleep quickly, probably because it is a 2am flight and I am tired already. An hour into the flight, breakfast is served. The choice is nasi lemak and egg omelette. The signature Malaysian dish did not disappoint. The meal comes with a muesli bar, plain croissant, mango yoghurt and fresh fruit. The croissant was cold but the main dish is cooked to perfection, with the string beans still looking green and chicken curry was tender and delicious.

One particular thing: Meal is not served in a big disposable tray as other airlines, but in a smaller box, which means less food is served. My biggest disappointment was that, in the last 3 legs, food choice offered was all the same - rice with fish and chicken with noodle. Since I don't eat fish, I would always choose the latter, and the taste, serving and even looks are all even exactly the same every time in all those legs! Fortunately for me, the IFE worked fine, and overall the cabin service was not all that special, seat was OK but not bad though, so I didn't have anything to complain other than the food. I hear that Malaysia Airlines has declined considerably since the two tragic incidents in 2014, and as a result they had their budget cut. However, considering that they were once a five star airline, I didn't expect their service to drop drastically as such (no meal tray provided!). The good news is, they announce sales promo frequently, and now they are cheaper than before. So if you don't demand much of an airline service and you're in a budget, in Southeast Asia, MH is a flight you might consider.";POSITIVE

I bought a heavily discounted business class ticket from a dubious online agency. Booked for 2 days earlier than actually travelled but could not make my domestic connection to SGN due to typhoons upcountry. Thus, had to cancel at the last minute and retime to 1-2 days later to be sure to catch the international flight as the typhoon was very persistent. While the OTA was useless, impossible to contact, and provided vertically no information apart from a ticket number and schedule, I was desperate and saw my ticket as likely lost. However, I made a call to MH directly (through Saigon Office) and they dealt with it professionally, took over the booking from the OTA, and rebooked me with amble time at almost no cost. And suddenly I could access my booking on their system and order seats and special meals etc. At check-in in Saigon everything went smooth and quick. I took me less than 5 minutes from arriving until I had all my boarding passes in hand. I thereupon had a positive chat with the check-in counter as they were not busy. Lounge is third-party and called Apricot, good service tarmac views, and cooperative lounge staff. A flight delay of 75 Minutes incurred but was announced in full and clearly already 2½ hours prior to departure. Later 30 Minutes were added to the delay. However, as the delays were clearly announced they just extended my lounge stay in Saigon and shortened my lounge stay in KLIA. Onboard, special meals were accommodated, FAs are professional, and service is good. Only problems is that on shorter regional flights the Airline is “dry” – even in business class. Not even beer is served. Transfer in KLIA was tight but went smooth as the departing flight was the gate next to the one arrived to. The next flight equally good and arrived on time in PNH. Special meals and three hot meals were offered. Had seat 1C with a legspace that I impossibly could use up as I could not even reach/touch the galley in front of me. My luggage was comprehensive (2 big pieces plus hand-luggage but was ready on the belt after I passed immigration. Miles credited to my Qatar FFP within a week. Could have been rated 10/10 but I deduct a bit for delay and for lack of varieties of drinks onboard. In summary: well done Malaysia Airlines – you are a rising star!";POSITIVE

London - Kuala Lumpur - Perth was a disaster to start with. Those days Malaysia Airlines were upgrading their systems and no online check-in was available, had to queue for roughly 2hrs 55 mins at Heathrow (try and imagine a queue for a packed A380) because 2 out 4 agents couldn't care less about the situation and decided to show up just 2 hrs prior to take-off. I mean, really? You know you are going to get massive queues, put more people to work for those 2/3 days of emergency. Obviously flight was delayed, roughly 80 mins - but arrived to KUL with just a 30 mins delay. Flight itself was less than remarkable. Food bland, entertaining system not brilliant, seats just OK and I didn't like the cabin crew's attitude as they all were rather uninterested and cold although not openly rude. One male member in particular acted like he was the owner of the airplane and was doing everybody a favor to be there. Transit in KUL was rather smooth and 737 to PER left on time. One of the bags didn't make it to our destination despite the connection being quite comfortable and received that with the following flight - lucky I had insurance to cover the emergency expenses. MEL-KUL on A330. No delays, same comments as above about food/cabin crew etc real problem for this flight was the state of the toilets. 3/4 hours into the flight they were filthy, smelly and just disgusting and no one cared to clean them. Been flying around the world and never seen something like that. KUL-LHR on A380 luckily enough I had booked preferred economy seats on the upper deck and the flight was smooth. Couldn't eat their food, I tried but it was just awful, but at least it departed on time, crew were better than what I had gotten until then and they managed not to misplace my bags. All in all a rather disappointing trip. Good if you want to save money but otherwise there are tons of better airlines out there.";NEGATIVE

The crew members were rude and abrupt and could not care less about the passengers throughout the flight - an example is when we had sat in the wrong seats by pure accident, one of the flight attendants rudely exclaimed 'You are in her seat!'. She could have asked politely to check our boarding passes that we were in the correct seat or even said something like sorry but I think you may be in the wrong seats. We had no issues with changing the seats as it was an accident on our part but would have appreciated some politeness. After serving dinner and lights turned off for people to go to sleep, we did not see a single crew member for about 4-5 hours (this was an 8 hour flight). On other airlines on flights of this duration crew members walk down the aisles with glasses of water every hour or so which my family would have appreciated as we were quite thirsty. Toilets did not seem to be cleaned throughout the flight and were in a terrible state a couple of hours before landing. Headphones were taken off passengers 45 minutes before landing so in-flight entertainment could not be used which is an issue particularly when travelling with kids. I have never seen this occur with any other airline. Seats were small and uncomfortable. Overall, this was a terrible experience I would have been better off paying a little extra and travelling with a better airline. Never again!";NEGATIVE

Over 50 passengers were waiting for their luggage and never one of them approached us to say the luggage has not arrived until we asked. According to them, the KL airport also has not given them any information regarding non loading of luggage. None of the staff was available and even when we complained to Malaysian staff the following day, he was not available at work and told us to call the Airport Luggage services and he was saying he cannot guarantee anything whether the luggage is even found or not. It was utter madness. And he failed to answer our phone when we called afterwards.

The business class seats had little legroom and the biggest downside was the tray table which was basically placed on the side of the seat and when unfolded was very close to the body - I could not push it further even if I wanted to. The width of the seat seems OK, but I keep touching the other passenger's elbow which shows that the arm rests seem to be too narrow. The food was pretty OK though on this route they did not serve alcohol. There are limited recline on the seats and - just like the economy seat - the screen is attached to the back of the seat in front of me. Thus, when the other seat reclines, we have to adjust the screen accordingly. I thought the business seats were not that special, and maybe sticking in economy is not a bad idea.";POSITIVE

I was impressed by the service and attitude of the crew, very welcoming and proactive. Throughout the night the temperature of the cabin was just right, each seat had lush pillow and duvet, ""Bed"" cover as well to add extra comfort. One little complain would be the tight space one has to squeeze into the laid flat. Since it wasn't a full flight, I asked for extra pillow and blanket as padding to facilitate sleeping on the side, and that made for a more comfortable experience.

Middle and right side seats are in pairs so you could be sitting with somebody else. There is no amenity pack on this service. A blanket and pillow are provided. This was a night service (23.30 departure) and possibly the worst I have ever had in a J class cabin. The flight was about 6hrs and 30mins. Just as you fall asleep during the takeoff, the lights are cranked on full for a forced refreshment service. Once that was over it took time to settle back down again and the constant seat belt on and off actions with associated announcements were very disturbing. Once I managed to sleep again, I was abruptly woken up some 2hrs 45mins before landing for a breakfast service with full lights in the cabin and crew calling for passengers who want to eat which almost nobody took. Then everyone sat bored and disturbed for the remainder of the flight. This is an airline which needs to get in touch with its premium product on board. The crew are nice enough and the food and beverage is not bad but the way the cabin is managed and service delivered has a long way for improvement. Business suites have independent seat lighting so for anyone who wants to eat, there is never a need on a night flight to illuminate the entire cabin. Being forced a breakfast 2.45 before landing is just not reasonable either. The airline should consider dine on demand service or at the most wake people up about an hour before landing. I found the whole flight irritating, managed about an hour of sleep and thus i probably wouldn't take this cabin on this airline again for the same flight.";POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2017-10-11;" |  Flying Malaysia Airlines for the first time, I had certain apprehensions given the turbulent couple of years for the airline. However, the flight schedules suited my short business trip to KL so I thought I'd just bite the bullet and have myself booked on the airline. Check-in in both MNL and KUL were swift through the business class lanes (I'm a OneWorld ruby member) but the J queue in MNL was ironically slower as the agent had to check in quite a number of bags for the party ahead of me. Outbound in Y was surprisingly pleasant with a decent set of inflight entertainment options, a USB port to charge my phone and tasty food options for the 3.5 hour flight. Flight attendants were robotic and not the usual hospitality seen in Asian carriers. Seat comfort, however, left much to be desired as one would find one's nose touching the screen if the passenger in front decides to recline. Fortunately, I had an empty middle seat in the 3-3 configured 737, the provided headsets were flimsy and I just used my own headphones. Inbound in J was an even more enhanced experience with very friendly FAs who addressed me by name and consistently checking on my needs. The sincerity was apparent as she knew my name even as we bumped into each other in the galley on my way to the lavatory. Seat was a standard recliner with a footrest which was pretty dated but they did provide noise cancelling headsets which are of passable quality.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-10-09; |  London to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Enjoyed the MAS lounge prior to boarding. Service and food once on board was very good. Only complaint was my seatbelt and buckle were caked in ice cream from previous occupant so needed to give it a thorough clean . Transit in KL was very comfortable and from previous experience expected the onward flight to be in the same terminal. Perth flight was from gate H which was a ride on the train from the lounge. Upon getting to the gate there was a long queue at security check as there was only one security gate in operation serving 2 flights. Finally when boarding aircraft realised it was a 737 which was a big disappointment as it was A330 service on previous trips and business class on 737 is not comparable to A380 or A330. Cabin crew on this flight were not of the high standard of first leg. Would definitely use MAS again but would avoid 737.;POSITIVE

Never the class leader I have always considered Malaysia Airlines  to be a decent runner up, but on this form service standards have taken a steep dive. Two of my recent flights were cancelled at short notice, without explanation or compensation and at some inconvenience. Whilst re booking my cancelled flight the airline tried to charge me a change of flight fee. Finally on board, I was moved from my reserved seat by a charmless steward claiming a 'booking error'. The food and beverage offer has declined markedly and cabin service generally has suffered. Not sure what has changed in the last year or so at MAS but there is plenty of strong competition on this route and having been a loyal customer of MAS over the years I have finally voted with my feet. My next two bookings are with BA and Singapore.";NEGATIVE

Boarding through gate E2 I reserved seat A5 when checking in this seat is the first in economy offering more leg room and often the middle seat empty, departed around 40 min late not sure why but it meant a late arrival by around 1 hour. Crew were polite, seats comfortable enough for a 2hr flight aircraft also offered PTV in every seat, a hot lunch tea and coffee offered the meal was actually not bad and more than edible.

Personal space on the Boeing 737 well exceeded the narrow body room on Qantas. 5 abreast on the A330 was acceptable but obviously narrower than some direct aisle 4 abreast alternatives. However the A380 upper deck configuration in the front section of business class was excellent. Service on all four flights exceeded expectation and the food especially those satay sticks was amongst the best in the air. I can live without alcohol on short haul flights and the choices were limited on the longer flights but this is a small concern. Toilet facilities were sufficient and kept clean. One flight 30 minutes late. This is an airline I would use again.;POSITIVE

I can't believe that there was no wine being served at all in Economy Class, and even for non-alcoholic drinks the choices were limited to either juices or carbonated drinks. Secondly, as an avid coffee drinker, the coffee served was tasteless without a single smell of coffee, it seems to me that it was not even prepared with grinned coffee bean but rather from instant coffee powder. The food that was below the standard economy meal that I was expecting, the bread was cold, the dessert which was a piece of banana cake. The flight attendant was not attentive, where she missed out in serving me the bread, and I had to request for it.

The IFE system, offered variety of movies, TV series and music to choose from. The cabin crew show professionalism, friendly and polite. I was in the main section of business cabin and the crew managed to kept the cabin and lavatory clean (flight was about 80% full in business cabin).

Onboard very old aircraft but the seat arrangement in business class was good. My single window seat was comfortable with good sleeping amenities and the food is tasty. But no menu available in a premium cabin. The stewardess had to rattle off the menu to an almost full cabin. No idea what their drink choices are as you do not feel like asking the staff. The crew did not personally welcome passengers and introduce the facilities as its the norm in other carriers. They were hard working but something was missing - perhaps the personal touch. The satay service before landing can be presented more elegantly rather than taking an empty trolley in to the cabin. All in all the cost cutting is very evident.";NEGATIVE

I got the ticket at a very attractive price, value for money was great, considered it's business class, with lounge access, free seat selection and a generous 40 kg allowance. MH is doing their best to regain their reputation, although with small Boeing 737 the facilities are unfortunately limited. For a short flight of less than 2 hours, it's fine though. Crew were courteous and did their best. Most of the MH flights under 3 hours do not serve alcohol, but except this one, alcohol is free flowing and plenty. Meals are ok but not excellent. All in all, I was very satisfied with the whole experience. Do consider flying their earlier flight, not the one arriving in Bali at 3:30pm, the immigration queue is painfully long, with 5 other flights all arriving at the same time. It took me over an hour to get though. Still, not the fault of the airline though.";POSITIVE

Checked in downtown and took the KLIA Express train to KL International. Went through security and then to the MAS Gold Lounge which is very big and a nice selection of food and drinks. Boarding was prompt though security is much more advanced prior to entering the Terminal itself. No priority for Business Class passengers at all. Seated in 2A which was the same seat I had from Melbourne to KL. Offered a juice or water and a hot towel before take off. Crew were very friendly and obliging. After take-off the drinks trolley appeared and the Satay service (I asked for seconds). Unlike the Melbourne to KL sector there was a Menu which I was shown and then ordered my dinner and more white wine. There was a cheese platter of sorts offered and a dessert wine. I could not fault the staff and the food. Seating comfortable though the area with a fully reclined chair for your feet is a tad small. I really enjoyed the flight and the staff were great. Landed on time in Melbourne and after nearly 45 years of flying it was the smoothest touch down on runway 34 that I have had.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-09-07;" |  After a comfortable flight from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur the preceding week, I was looking forward to my return flight home to Melbourne later in August. Unfortunately, after the flight commenced, I discovered that the electronic seat controls did not work and my seat (7A) could not be adjusted via the control panel. I then had to wait until the meal service was completed before two crew members attempted to adjust the seat manually. This required me to stand in the adjacent economy section where other passengers were trying to sleep. My apologies to the poor man whom I accidentally bumped when moving for crew. Eventually, the seat was adjusted to a very uncomfortable sleeping position for the rest of the flight. I was very concerned, however, that it could not be readjusted to the required position for landing in Melbourne. The crew were very apologetic and undertook to report this situation. An alternative seat could not be offered as the flight was full. Subsequently, I lodged a complaint with Malaysia Airlines, requesting compensation for my flight costs only to be now offered 5000 Enrich points instead - hardly equivalent to the $1600 that this flight cost me. I've twice requested a review of this offer and have yet to receive the courtesy of a response. I'll not be recommending this airline to anyone else.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-09-07;" | Had a horrible night flying with Malaysia Airlines. First, I booked for MH804 (Kuala Lumpur to Manila), scheduled to fly 3rd September, 5.30 PM. At first, we were informed that our flight will be delayed for two hours due to adverse weather around airport. We were OK with this. However, after around 3.5 hours, there was no information about the status of the flight. The gate crew did not know what was the status of the flight, where is the plane, and where is the cabin crew. The in-duty manager was unreachable. There was neither food nor water provided during this period. Bad thing is that we had elderly and babies among the passengers. Then after 4 hours, we were told that we can board the plane. We boarded, then after 1 hour waiting in the plane (no flying yet), we were informed that the cabin crew apparently have exceeded their duty limit period, and thus they have to make decision whether they were going to find replacement, or cancel the flight. After waiting for one more hour inside the plane, we were told that the replacement crew will be fling from Singapore and we can fly at around 2 AM in the morning. Everyone were asked to step down from the plane. At least at this point they have decency to provide us flight meal. Then came 2 AM, the replacement crew apparently could not make it, so the flight have to be cancelled. Some of us get lucky to be rebooked to MH806 flying next morning, some others, well, I do not know what happened to them. No hotel room was provided, some of us trying to make up rest at the airline lounge, which is very bad. As a result, I had to stay up all night, miss important meeting in the next day, and spend the following day on sick leave.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-09-07;" |  Kuala Lumpur to Male via Colombo. After booking a vacation in September 2016 to Maldives, on April 6th my wife called to check our seating arrangements. The MH agent said our connecting flight to Male from Colombo was cancelled to our surprise, which meant we would have to have a 8-9 hour wait in Colombo. Knowing some friends were on this flight but book via Sri Lankan airlines, we checked with them, finding out the flight was not cancelled at all. Then we called Sri Lanka airlines and they also confirmed the flight was fine. So my wife initially called MH customer service spending 3-4 hours (3-4 calls) trying to sort out the problem. She was put on hold for hours only to be cut off. Many times they promised to call back, no call was ever returned. After her frustration, I called, similar responses, on hold for over 4 hours (4 calls), called hung up after being put on hold, promises made for returned call, etc. What was frustrating is that we told the agents clearly the flight was not cancelled, Why could they not escalate?  On the date of our flight we went to the airport hoping possibly getting on our correct flight, but when we went to Sri Lankan airlines, they said they could not book us in.  No only was our 2nd flight changed but we could not even get on the flight we booked on. After back and forth between the two airlines,  MH put us back on the flight which we booked and had never changed anyway by reissuing the ticket. After arriving in Colombo, we realized that the mistake of our 2nd flight would not be resolved, and we had to wait 8-9 hours in the Colombo airport. Now to find out that our flight back to KL from Colombo was moved 1 day.  We called long distance, only to have the same issues with the customer service staff. On hold, no answer, no return call, etc. The agents response was that they could not put us back on the same flight we booked, as the rates went up, amazing but we never changed the flight, MH did.

Boeing 737-800 aircraft. The trip was basically faultless and on time - only tainted by these few minor things: Only 2 hours check in time in PNH is not enough, they are constantly cutting this. Used to be 3 hours, them 2½ hours and now 2 hours. 4 check-in desks are not enough, as I came way early and wasted 30 minutes to check in – in the elite queue. Boarding cards could not be provided throughout – not even at check-in desk in PNH. Internet net check in is a joke – you sit and mingle and waste time again and again to come to the Salomonic reply: ”Please finalise check-in in Airport to have your BPs provided” No alcohol on board on any classes at any time. This is a crime against flyer buffs and a completely unnecessary mean of patronizing customers. If you want a beer you have to cling to the lounges. Food mediocre, but nice with a hot meal – it was quite filling. On the positive side there are numerous pearls in the chain: Luggage checked in throughout (even without the last Boarding Pass). Lounge in PNH is a pleasure, though showing a decline during the last 1 year: they use 3rd party lounge Plaza Premium – good, airy, and spacy. Drinks limited (no champagne, no beer apart from local draught beer, etc.). Bakery has become dormant. On board: Special meals accommodated to perfection. Drink round provided but only 1 on each of 4 two-hours flight is not enough. Go to the galley and you shall receive more drinks. Coffee served was absolutely top notch – Starbuck can go home! Check in good and luggage transferred throughout. The missing BP that they could not issue in PNH was issued in 10 seconds (!) when I came to the desk in KUL. Mileage granted even for this low fare. Lounge in KUL perfect for an Emerald flyer. I stayed overnight in their premises. Staff onboard were all very friendly, energetic, and tolerated that I consumed my own drink purchased in airport – at times I buy supplies, as I know about the MH drinking (saving cost?) fear. IFE onboard is a joke: no hearing device, no screens opened, so absent in economy. Old, worn aircraft, however, the seats in are soft and spacious and table trays had been rehabilitated and were firm and good. I could stretch out my legs completely in row no. 5 (the first one after business class). They kept middle seats free (as much as possible) in the 3x3 configuration. A pleasurable journey and I will gladly take the trouble again diverting my travels through KUL – at least as long I am elite flyer in Oneworld (at Qatar) and they have these incredible bargains. Toilets were clean – it helps that they virtually prevent people from drinking by extremely limited choice of drinks using small paper mugs. However, I assume that I have become addicted to this airline in my attempts to revive it. Helped by the discounts campaigns I take the troubles extending my time. Of course my Oneworld elite status helps a lot to make my travels smooth. But having travelled on MH for years I have never missed a flight or lost a suitcase.";POSITIVE

For maximum comfort, try to choose the ""throne"" seat if possible, 1K, 4K or 6K, offering exceptional personal space and storage. A ""Breakfast"" of 3 choices were offered after take off, although of course you may choose to sleep a bit first and eat a bit later. Being only 5:30 hours long, it is hard to choose between dine now and sleep later or the opposite. Crew were very hard working and present. I only managed a shut-eye for an hour, and stayed up most of the time. Crew offered me array of hot drinks and snacks. I was quite impressed by the service and food quality on board.

There used to be a place close to the stairs (on the top deck) where you could help yourself to soft drinks, snacks and a magazine. Not now, nothing there, empty. When I fly Thai or Singapore Airlines on a long haul the staff are constantly coming round with water or a juice. Not Malaysia Airlines, not once did a member of staff walk through the business class aisle to ask or serve anyone. I fly quite a lot to South East Asia and many times with MH but this was the last time, the company has gone down hill fast. Their customer services are slow to answer emails if at all. My luggage was damaged in transit and they have admitted liability (I have email verification from their claims dept). They offered me a renumeration package which I accepted but I have yet to receive it. ";NEGATIVE

Very little to eat though the self-service bar was open. Boarding called and a designated Business Class boarding lane. Seat 2A next to the window. Juice or water offered prior to take-off but no champagne! After take off the drinks trolley appeared and ordered a gin and tonic. On the downside there were no menus for food and drink offered but the standard satay trolley was next and they were wonderful. Following that orders were taken for lunch but still no menu. I ordered the Beef Rendang which was excellent and some ice-cream which came in plastic tub. No cheese and biscuits with a post lunch wine was offered. Movie selection was just ok but had to use the touchscreen as the remote on my seat wasn't working so had a feeling there were a lot more movies in the system but hard to get to them. Snacks were chips or biscuits and an extra ice-cream if you wanted. Prior to landing was offered a Lamb Pie which was very good and another glass of the excellent white wine. Overall a pleasant but not outstanding flight but I give full credit to the crew who were wonderful and the seat which was very comfortable. Just bring back a menu and wine list and cheese and biscuits after a nice meal!! Landed ahead of time and breezed through immigration and customs and then the KL Express into Kuala Lumpur.

However, the service I encountered during my second flight (before I boarded the airplane) was terrible. I checked in online and received my boarding pass sent to my email. I was confused about whether this boarding pass would let me on the plane or if I needed to go to the checkin counter, but the security officer checking tickets and IDs said my ticket was okay. The immigration officer also confirmed that my ticket was okay, but pointed me to information if I had questions. After a lot of calls, information got in touch with a Malaysia Airlines representative who said they would give me a different ticket at the gate, but information said they weren't sure if the boarding pass on my phone was acceptable or not. Then I went through another security check with the boarding pass on my phone. I arrive at the gate and a kind flight attendant scans the boarding pass on my phone and I thought everything was fine. But then a male representative for Malaysia Airlines brought me the tickets and yelled at me about why I used the boarding pass on my phone and how it was possible that I got through all the security. At this point, everyone at the gate was watching and I was extremely uncomfortable. He then informed me that none of this was his fault and yelled at me more about how much I inconvenienced the staff. I made an honest mistake and I apologized to him, but I am shocked that an airline employee would yell at a passenger in such a manner. I am also disappointed that it took so long to determine whether the boarding pass on my phone was acceptable. Looking back on the email I received from the airline with my boarding deal my pass, there is conflicting and unclear information, but I also should have called the airline before to clarify. I felt extremely uncomfortable and nervous after this employee left because I was worried I would encounter him again on the plane. ";POSITIVE

They don't even offer beer to accompany the lunch with. Just water or their selection of artificial fruit juices. Either it's a cost cutting measure, or the airline is beginning ever more wahabi, in deference to Malaysia's Muslim majority. Though it's hard to see how they expect to compete against the likes of Emirates, Etihad, or Qatar, flag carriers of countries 99+% Muslim, who serve alcohol to passengers understanding that not all passengers are Muslim and that not all Muslims avoid alcohol. The passengers in the business class cabin were anyway mostly of Chinese origin, so it's hard to see how this no-alcohol policy endears them to their main paying clientele.

Upon arrival in DPS found that our bags had not been loaded on the flight. There was chaos at baggage handling as there were a significant number of bags missing. Promised the bag would arrive later that day but in fact arrived late the next morning. No answer on the Missing Luggage Office number in KL. We are frequent travellers and know that flights are delayed and that bags go missing however with MH it was exacerbated by chaos, misinformation or no information.

malaysia-airlines;2017-08-09;" |  Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. You get what you pay for: MH has tried to pick up its game, but it has missed the mark. The new business class product on its A330s for long-haul service (like the KUL-SYD and SYD-KUL flights I just took) are a welcome improvement over the out-of-date 2-2-2 recliners on this plane before. However, the unique and strange cabin arrangement defeats the value of much of that improvement. For starters, each BC seat varies in space offered to the ticket-holder - in some cases, dramatically. For single (solo) fliers, the ""king's throne"" seats along the right side windows - only 3 of them - offer amazing privacy and storage. however, in 3 different rows (2K, 4K, and 6K). However, MH has chosen to cram in two business class seats into that same space allocated to one seat in 4 other rows. Therefore, a solo traveler stuck in the right-side window seats of XX, 5K, or 7K - will find her/himself wedged in with no direct aisle access, no privacy from the adjacent seat-holder, and almost no storage space. For a couple traveling together, the 6 pairs of center seats (D and G) offer considerably more privacy, space and storage options than the two seats on the right-side windows. Then there's the bizarre lavatory allotment. There's effectively only one lav for all 27 business class seats in the front of the plane, accessed by navigating through the galley. for some incomprehensible reason, and unlike other airlines flying the A330 with a business class, MH chose not to fill all of the space between the 1L/1R and 2L/2R doors with business class, but instead place four rows of economy inside that space, so instead of allowing the doors to form a natural barrier between business class and economy class, there's just a slim wall/curtain and then the two lavs adjacent to the  doors - which crew will insist are accessible to the business class ticket-holders -- are in effect used mainly by economy class seat-holders.  Overall, the A330 business class seat is passable, not great, it is quite narrow, not allowing for easy turning, and it barely allow for a 185cm person to get his legs feet into the cramped well. On the bright side, the shortcomings in the hardware department were made up considerably by the very professional, friendly and accommodating crew. Given the late hour of departure from SDY (2.345) the FA offered to serve any form of meal or snack at any later time. Wine choices were good and food was surprisingly tasty. The IFE, on the other hand, is limited in variety and old - they've had the same first-season of sitcoms offered for many months. only a few big new release movies. No WiFi offered. Ground staff was far less impressive, allowing passengers to start boarding and filling up the airbridge but blocked at the aircraft door by FAs not ready to receive passengers. I fly MH in business class because it often comes at a low price and I want a lie-flat bed for long-haul flights, but the time-honored adage could not be more accurate in this regard: you get what you pay for.";POSITIVE

Malaysia Airlines aircraft is quite old for this flighht, I noticed they always send their older aircraft to Indonesia and Thailand, and their new one only to Singapore. The cabin crew were very nice and polite, keep serving me drinks and food - however, the food was bad. The entertainment had so many advertisement which are annoying. Comparing to other airline with the same route, this business class fare from MH is the cheapest.";POSITIVE

A more spacious A330 aircraft has been deployed for both legs, the new ""Throne"" style business class seat offers so much space and comfortable to sleep in. Menu has been removed, instead stewardess announces to each passengers what is on offer. On routes over 3 hours, alcohol is available. Portions of meals were decent and tasty. Inflight service is fine, warm and efficient. I only had 55 minutes to transfer and I was glad I made it, so did my luggage. When Malaysia Airlines offer attractive discounts (like this time), it is really worth considering.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-07-30;" |  London Heathrow to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. London to KUL on A380 upper deck. Delayed by 4 hours but kept informed. Boarded an hour before take off and was roasted in the cabin as the a/c was not on while we waited. Drinks were served to rehydrate us. Finally left at about 1am which we had a slight panic about as I presume special permission must have been sought to fly after Heathrow's closing hours - so good on them as we would've missed our Kuala Lumpur to Sydney flight. Definitely worth trying to get a seat on the upper deck as they're more spacious and also less populated. Food good, drinks were sporadically offered but not as often as I would expect (compared to previous experience). Inflight entertainment ok, although my daughter's wasn't working but there was a spare seat. Service was fairly middling. Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on A330. Seating more cramped than previous flight, more atypical of an Economy Class seat. Entertainment ok, although one of our seats could only operate this facility using touch screen as console wasn't working. Drinks constantly offered. Food was one main meal which was great and one snack (chicken pasty) which was fairly inedible. For an 8 hour flight, perhaps the snack should be better. Full flight but crew worked hard to keep everyone happy. Departed and arrived on time. Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on A330. My mother who needed wheelchair assistance and this service was very good with the ground staff ensuring we had really good seats. If possible, try to get seats in Rows 9, 10 or 11 as they have very good legroom. Fairly empty flight and the crew were fantastic - probably the best I've encountered in Economy. They really couldn't do enough. Main meal good, the snack was a pizza which was much more edible than the pasty on the outbound flight. Departed and arrived on time. KL - London on A380. Again managed a seat on the Upper Deck - really can't recommend enough that you try to source these seats. One of the attendants on our Sydney to Kuala Lumpur leg the week before was on this flight and I knew we were going to be in good hands. Once again, fantastic service with constant drinks being served. Food again was good. This airline is certainly working towards regaining their previously good reputation and I would certainly fly with them again.";POSITIVE

Like my previous flight, the lunch meal served in a small box with mineral water and peanuts, the portions was still small but the taste was so much better than my previous flight from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. The cabin looked old, a little bit dirty, and needs to refurbished. No IFE. Since this was a short flight so I can't complaint but they can do better for their aircraft cleanliness since I know some of airline which still use the same age aircraft with better cabin condition.";NEGATIVE

The aircraft was the new NG with sky interior installed. The cleanliness was just barely okay, you could spot a few dirt spot on the seats. IFE is enough for this 2 hour flight. They served 2 choices of hot meals, not served on a tray but in a small paper box with mineral water and peanuts. Having flown with them frequently, the best thing with this airline is still the flight attendants, they were polite, and served the passengers efficiently. Not the best airline but still no complaints about the service.";POSITIVE

Lets get the bad bit out of the way, the flight was delayed by about an hour and the plane became unbearable hot, APU failure and Heathrow not able to cater for a hot day unlike other airports. After start up all was good though, Captain continued to keep us in the picture with the issue and apologising. On boarding not a problem, well organised and for such a plane pretty quick. Crew were immediately attentive and helpful and this carried on throughout the flight, nice to see the purser about all the time instead of being huddled in their little cubby hole. IFE acceptable, films I could watch, American TV channels are dire, MA can we have some good TV out of the UK. The only nuisance was the lag when asking it to do something. Drinks were offered all the time and were readily available, pre\with and after dinner and during the flight. Both meals I would gladly have paid for, it was better than our national airlines Business class, just not plated up. Seat was very acceptable and think it is one of the best out there for economy. All in all a good flight, well done Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE

After the second security I received a text saying our flight was delayed. It was only about half hour so not that bad. The staff especially the male FA was nice. I smiled and thanked him for the drink and nuts so he gave us extra, I guess for being polite. The plane was reasonably new and even had entertainment screens. We wasted time as the pilot had to fly south of KL and circle around a while to get the okay to land at KL. if I was to go the route again I would probably go Air Asia though.";POSITIVE

Good price, day flights, generous 30kg baggage allowance and ability to check bags ahead the day before at KLIA, the 2-4-2 seating is great for couples. Flight to KL Left 30 min late but arrived early. The seat was narrow but had good leg room. The IFE was very slow to respond and the annoying ads before each show whether movie or TV show was annoying. The movies were either old or mostly detective / murder / action / sci fi. We got peanuts and a choice of juice soon after take off. Food was served about an hour or so into the flight, choice of chicken curry or basil fish. We were in row 24, four up from the toilets which reeked. Quiet flight though, no screaming kids. A pizza thing was served before landing, congealed and barely lukewarm, inedible. There were no landing cards to be filled in before arrival. It's all biometric. First time I've experienced that. Returning started poorly, in the holding pen at KLIA, I needed the toilet. The gate agent said he'd hold my boarding pass and I'd collect it from him on my return. Long wait in line up but finally got back to him and he had lost it, said he gave it to a friend at the desk who had left. Made me sit by the door till all passengers had gone through and boarded. Was getting worried by now. I did know my seat number though. Eventually he sat at a computer and gave me a print out. The plane was newer than the one we flew up in and the IFE more responsive. Still annoying ads. The brunch was minimal in size, a quiche and two cakes. Before landing we got given a pastry thing. We landed an hour earlier than scheduled. Would I fly with them again? Doubtful. Keep your expectations low if flying with them.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-07-04;" |  Return flight from Melbourne home on 3/7/17. Check-in at Melbourne airport was tedious as the queues were long and no attempt to manage the queue lines. It was a full flight as it was Australian school holidays. They gave an incorrect gate number which they 'rectified' later. The boarding area was congested at Gate 7 and little attempt was made by ground staff to organize the seating and boarding. They did request parents with children and strollers to come forward but allowed eager passengers to block the boarding area. Again, no boarding by zones which is odd considering this was a full flight. Malaysia Airlines doesn't seem to like controlling the boarding process both at KLIA or elsewhere. The flight itself was uneventful. The FAs were polite and efficient but did not bother to interact with the passengers or exude any warmth or interest in their passengers. In contrast to the Qantas flight I took a few days ago, the warmth of the FAs was like chalk and cheese. The main meal was okay but the snack served before landing was tasty. They called it a pizza but it was really a pie. The FAs did keep everybody well watered and answered calls promptly. The IFE was okay, not a great selection but okay for an 8 hour flight. Baggage arrived really late but that is not the fault of MH but rather the poor service of KLIA. Even the baggage belt was not updated with flight arrivals and pax were walking around enquiring asking staff for help.";POSITIVE

However, as Malaysia Airlines have several flights daily, I became allowed by the MH Airport manager to check in on a flight earlier. That meant instant check-in and lounge access. Both flights on time. Good lounge in SGN (Apricot) and even better in KLIA where I was let into the First Class Lounge (Oneworld Emerald status). Food onboard was good, at least 2 options of hot meals despite short flights of approx. 2 hours. My special meals ordered (seafood) was honoured – except for the 1st flight where I forsaked it purposely at check-in as they obviously could not handle it with very short notice. I was given the best economy seats available, even without requesting for it. FAs were all top notch, alert, and kind to all passengers. They instantly recognised me as high level tier card-holder and got lots of attention, despite travelling on a shameless cheap economy ticket, paying 166 USD for a return ticket of 4 legs. No alcohol onboard, but the lounges they provide have plenty. In KUL they have champagne as well as sparkling Pinot Noir wine from Australia. Noisy, old aircraft, but well maintained. Generous luggage allowance starting with 30 kg in economy plus whatever can be added for elite card holders. Good IFE with personal monitors. MH is upping the game. KLIA airport is nice and quick to manoeuvre in.";POSITIVE

Although it involved backtracking by flying south to Kuala Lumpur on my way to London, I have no regrets about choosing Malaysia Airlines. The check-in went smoothly then the flights left more-or-less on-time. The cabin crew were attentive and professional and the food they served was pretty decent in the context of economy class. My only criticisms here were the fact short-haul flights are dry even in Business class and also the fact that the only snacks on the galley on the Kuala Lumpur to London route were packets of salted peanuts. At the same time Malaysia Airlines was generous with free drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) on the flight to London and for me and many other passengers this is very important. The A380 and 737 were both comfortable. My only criticism was the fact my key pad for controlling entertainment, my reading light and the call button was broken meaning I had to stand up to press the call button or use the touch screen to control my entertainment. Overall my experience was a positive one and I will not hesitate to book flights with Malaysia Airlines in the future. In fact in light of the recent cuts by British Airways I would happily pay more money to fly with Malaysia Airlines over British Airways.";POSITIVE

I was rather happy to be able fly in the A380. The cabin crew were absolutely excellent in the air. Whatever you wanted was never any trouble for them.

Flight from SIN to KL was delayed leaving 50 min to take the KL to HYD flight. However flight was delayed by 20 min, so I thought there was time (1 hr 10 min) to transfer baggage. But baggage not delivered. I had to wait for nearly 40 hours and endless calls to have my baggage finally delivered. And it happened during my return journey too. This time baggage delivered the same day. Malaysia Airlines refused to apologise and offer me even the basic compensation.

An announcement was made for passengers needing assistance and people traveling with young children but everyone ignored the announcement and rushed forward and the gate staff did nothing about it. Malaysia Airlines needs to get their act together re boarding as this is not the first time this has happened. Once on board, the inflight service was good. FA's were efficient and helpful but it was clear that they were woefully understaffed in economy. The flight was delayed by one hour and there was an apology from the flight deck. The food service took ages as only one FA was distributing meals on each aisle. There was turbulence regularly throughout the flight and clear announcements were made to this effect. However, the FA's were reluctant to serve hot beverages once the seat belt sign was off. Despite this, many people were asking for tea and coffee so eventually it came out but it was lukewarm. The meal was very tasty but the portion size has shrunk considerably. The cabin was scruffy and the toilets could have been cleaner. Overall, there is room for improvements in food portion size, more FA's needed on board and boarding at KLIA needs to be looked at.";POSITIVE

We spoke to someone at the airport, (after looking for someone, no one came to the gate to advise what was happening) on evening of 22 May 2017 and was advised that we had been put on alternative flights and that we could either stay in a hotel or go home and be reimbursed taxi fares to and from. We were advised to claim the taxi fares we could submit our receipts online, but I can't see where to do this on their website. When we arrived at the airport to check in my husband and I were seated separately, so we requested to be sat together and boarding passes were reissued. We asked if it was possible for an upgrade and were advised there was only one seat left. When we went into the the Qantas gold club lounge we were advised we couldn't enter due to staff not transferring our frequent flyer numbers to the new reservation and boarding passes even though we gave the lady at check in our frequent flyer numbers again. When we boarded the plane we were seated three rows from the back with hardly anyone else on the flight, my husband is a Sapphire oneworld member, where is the priority in relation to the seating. We spoke to the steward on the plane and were advised that there were 5 business class seats free. Through this whole ordeal there has not been adequate information flowing through. What we would like is to be reimbursed the taxi fares and meal at the airport. Since the above original email on 23/5/17 I haven't heard from anyone in customer service, even though I have emailed 7 times now. I have messaged through facebook and was advised to send in a complaint. I have done this three times now. I have sent in the receipts for reimbursement as advised and still nothing. How does one outside Malaysia get in contact? Also due to the original inadequacies I now have to claim my missing points. I think Malaysia Airlines should reevaluate their third party lounge at Manila airport absolute disgrace, ended up using Japan Airlines lounge. Never again will I use this airline, even at the loss of the points which was one of the only reasons we used this airline. ";NEGATIVE

My flight to Bangkok departed with only half the plane filled and was delayed slightly due to aircraft arriving late from the leg before. However, the service and professionalism on board is second to none and I must thank the cabin crew for delivering an impeccable service and the pilots for a safe and smooth landing after a go around due to bad weather when arriving in Bangkok. The meals on board were edible if not somewhat salty on the departing leg (I ordered a biryani chicken) but drinks option have been severely limited compared to the last time I travelled with MH. IFE choice selection was ok but the hardware looks worse for wear due to unresponsive screen and faulty joystick and usb port. The aircraft cleanliness overall was acceptable except for dirty windows and a few tray tables. The return leg was uneventful as the aircraft departed on time and arrived early. However, Malaysia Airlines should seriously be more consistent in its product and not schedule a 737 without IFE and BSI on international flights. I lost count how many times I'm on board 9M-FFF for the returning leg from SIN, PEN (X2), LGK and BKK (X2). Maybe I'm destined with this particular 738 but I don't know why they should continue leasing the oldest 738 of the fleet that has a product that differs from the majority of the 738 fleet.";POSITIVE

Cabin crew and ground staff were helpful and certainly have no problems with any service here. While it might seem picky I do have to point out the food was really not that impressive and some of the breakfast options served seemed very unpalatable, on a long haul flight which is stressful and not particularly comfortable at best I would have expected Malaysia Airlines to put in a little more effort to put travelers at ease and feel like they are getting value for money.

I find this particularly irritating because I fly a lot with Malaysia. Then I looked back through the comments posted here. There is a common thread – frontline staff try hard and customer service is good (despite the food being mediocre) - but head office is rubbish. It’s ridiculous that MH has gone to such lengths to rehabilitate itself after some unfortunate incidents. That its front-line staff, in the airport and on the plane, try hard to provide good service, only to be undermined by the staff in HQ.

Service by the friendly flight attendants was efficient and warm in typical Malaysian hospitality style. Drink service included champagne. There was a choice of 3 main courses for lunch and I had the lamb stew which was good. Being a short flight, they did not serve their signature Malaysian satay. The IFE had a decent selection of the latest movies and music but since it was a short 2.5 hour flight I decided to have a short nap after lunch.

Early 2016 we booked our flights. Sep 2016 the agent emails us with an unintelligible email which we gathered said 2 of the 4 legs were cancelled. The agent wouldn't help us. We contacted Malaysia direct who seemed quite keen for us to cancel our entire flights. Then tried to book us alternatives requiring an 8 hour KL stopover which we refused. They eventually gave us flights leaving in the early hours of the morning from Perth. We grudgingly accepted them as we had dependent arrangements in London. We looked up the replacement flights at the time on the booking website and they were cheaper than the daytime flights we'd originally booked by approx A$150 per person (x4). We contacted their head office who gave us an email address to use to ask for refunds of the difference. They have never replied to us prior to the flight. After we returned I followed them up again and they replied quickly saying that because we'd already completed the flights we couldn't get a refund. When I pointed out that they'd ignored my refund request before we flew they came back and just reiterated that it was too late. Totally unreasonable behaviour in my book. I also wrote to their CEO who also ignored me. The whole saga was a stressful hassle and we have never been listened to. We categorically will never use Malaysia Airlines again, their head office couldn't care less about customer satisfaction.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-05-12;" | Kuala Lumpur to Perth. Check-in through mobile and easy to navigate around. I am able to save my boarding pass on my iPhone Wallet app which makes it easier. However at the check-in counter Malaysia Airlines will still print a hardcopy of boarding pass for you. The ground staff lacks control when the passengers are boarding the plane. Passengers board altogether instead of according to seat allocations, passengers with special assistance, families with infants and children, business class, Enrich gold and silver members etc. This has not changed since the last time I flew with Malaysia Airlines in February 2017. Peanuts and drinks including alcoholic beverage served as soon aircraft is airborne. For dinner there was a choice of chicken with wedges or fish with rice. Dinner also comes with dinner roll, coleslaw and tiramisu. Generous portion and deliciously cooked, fish is beautifully prepared. Overall Malaysia Airlines is slowly gaining my trust after years of mismanagement of the airline. If they continue to improve their services and offer competitive price, I don't see why I will not choose to fly with Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-05-12;" | Malaysia Airlines check-in at Perth is seamless and easy, especially when you have done web check-in so you can avoid the long queue. Although the incoming flight from Kuala Lumpur is late, the cabin crew worked quickly to reduce the delay time which is greatly appreciated. Boarding was quick and easy. Plenty of legroom for seat at 9C which makes the journey more comfortable for taller passengers. Seats were comfortable. I had the Nasi Lemak and I was excited when the cabin crew mentioned nasi lemak is an option for breakfast. Well cooked and even at 10,000 feet up in the air, it still tastes authentic and delicious. Breakfast also comes with croissant, yoghurt, muesli bar and fruits, orange juice and choice of coffee or tea. What is weird though is that breakfast is served at 3am when the flight is scheduled to arrive in Kuala Lumpur at 8am. I would prefer to have breakfast served around 5 or 6 am in the morning. Inflight entertainment - Going Places magazine is easy to read and lots of interesting articles. However it maybe a little too thin for longer journeys such as KUL-SYD or KUL-LHR. Overall a pleasant trip with Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE

Boarding at KLIA via separate entry. The satay was the one of the best, there was so much that you could have multiple servings. I was already full when the western appetizers of Prawn Cocktail were offered. Well presented and tasty. The main course was filet mignon which was tender and moist. The seat reclined to fully flat and I slept most of the flight. Not the best bed seat I've had but it did the job. For breakfast I had red tomato chilli chicken rice. Very moist and well balanced.";POSITIVE

Kuala Lumpur to New Delhi, 17 Apr 2017, had a Cabin manager who spent most the flight chatting to a passenger/off duty pax in the galley. Then he disappeared. Service was robotic and minimal. Most annoying of all was though lights were dimmed in the economy cabin 2 hours into the flight (night flight), they blazed in business class until 10 minutes before decent when someone thought maybe they should be dimmed. Really appalling. Why bother after 5 hours of a 5.5 hour flight. New Delhi to Kuala Lumpur, 1 May 17, MH191 was a delight. Cabin Manager who really put the effort in. Knew your requirements before you had thought of them yourself. Had the service completed and lights dimmed within 2 hours, even with heavy turbulence. Chatty and genuine. Food, once a distinguishing feature of MAS, was ordinary at best, as it often (but not always) is these days. A real pity. Seat comfort quite acceptable.";NEGATIVE

At Manila the aircraft took off half an hour late, which made me worried about my connecting flight to Jakarta. It turns out my flight to Jakarta was delayed for 1 hour. However when I got to the gate, there was a chaotic sight as there was another flight to Shanghai departing from the same gate. Finally the flight departed 2 hours late.

malaysia-airlines;2017-05-01;" |  Flew London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur. I have been a long standing passenger with Malaysia Airlines for well over a couple of decades. Through this time, the airline has had several ups and downs which were also experienced by passengers such as myself. Nevertheless, I have continued to fly with the airline probably because of habit, even though I have had reasons to complain on numerous occasions. I have now decided to put pen to paper here because of a recent complaint I submitted but did not even get an acknowledgement including to a follow-up mail. The issue I have now is that the airline's Enrich Loyalty Scheme is not a loyalty scheme at all from my experiences. For example, a few months ago, I had an accumulation of about 160,000 points. My flights were for the end of January 2017 and early February. The ticket was booked and paid for in early December. I requested to use my points for upgrade from economy to business, but was told I had to be on the wait-list and there was one other person ahead of me. I followed up on numerous occasions and on each occasion was informed that I was till on the wait-list. While still on the wait-list I had well over 20,000 points which expired at the end of December. I remained on wait-list till the time of my check-in for my flight in early February, when I was informed there is an upgrade seat to business available. I accepted the offer. However, what is the point of being upgraded with my points at the last moment. It did not enable me to utilise the benefits such as baggage allowance, etc. This is an example of why the airline Enrich loyalty scheme is not a loyalty scheme for loyal customers. ";NEGATIVE

However 2 days before flight was offered chance to bid for an upgrade to business class, which I succeeded in obtaining for an extra US395 one way. Then the problems began. The upgrade was mistakenly given to my travelling partner who had opted to stay in economy. Boarding passes were back to front, I was still in economy, he was upgraded to business! No matter how hard I tried, it fell on deaf ears. No one was interested, nobody wanted to help. I spent over an hour pleading my case but to no avail. Staff were rude, arrogant and obtuse, even trying to blame me for the situation.  I asked for my money back, ""policy is no refund on upgrades"".  It is incredulous that a company treats passangers in this way! ";NEGATIVE

No information was given about delay until flight due to board. Not informed at that stage that flight would be delayed for 12 hours. At approx 01.00 informed that flight rescheduled to 11.30am the next day. crew observed leaving gate. 1st and Business class passengers then requested go to desk to be transferred to hotels. Economy class passengers told to wait in very cold and uncomfortable lounge (thin blankets and food vouchers had been provided. only one food outlet-Burger King -apparently open by this stage, not everyone could get food.) No further announcements regarding hotel transfer. At approx 2.30am, economy class passengers began moving out departure lounge (no announcement to this effect) as word got round that lounge being closed. Large numbers of passengers then made their way through airport with minimal assistance from Malaysia airlines staff (i.e. one person shouting 'London flight' and pointing us toward immigration desks, followed by another person after immigration directing us to limousine desk). Very slow progress through immigration as very few desks open and no apparent effort made to open more despite efforts of one official to speed proceedings up. Chaos at 'limousine' desk-one individual working extremely hard however to get large numbers of people on buses and to hotels. Finally boarded minibus at approx 04.00am for 40 minutes drive to a very nice hotel on outskirts of KL. Got to room by 05.00am, had to be back in hotel reception by 09.00am for bus back to airport Overall very poor treatment of economy class of this A380. Once on the plane however, the flight itself was good - the cabin crew worked very hard to provide good levels of service (despite large numbers of justifiably tired and emotional passengers), the food was mostly good, and there was a comfortable seat and lots of leg room which is the main reason I have chosen this airline for London/KL/Sydney flights over the past 8 years. However this represented an extreme deterioration in the level of service expected from them - I have had better levels of service and communication from budget airlines. I was also unfortunate enough to experience a shorter delay, also for 'technical reasons' on the outbound flight from London 2 weeks previously, but that was managed well despite missing my connection to Sydney. After this experience, unlikely I will fly with them again, which is a shame as they have always provided value for money and a comfortable flight experience.";NEGATIVE

At boarding noted that the seats on the boarding pass issued at airport are different! I spoke to the staff and they showed no interest in doing anything. Very bad attitude towards customer. I have the airline the benefit of doubt for the computer error, however on my return journey I'm having same issues, slow check in and wrong seats again.

malaysia-airlines;2017-04-19;" |  London to Kuala Lumpur return. Without doubt the worst airline I've flown - both long haul and short haul. An incredible level of incompetence in the digital age. On the outbound flight, we called Malaysia Airlines and pre-booked exit seats several weeks in advance (all ok). Turned up to Heathrow and the Malaysia Airlines computer system had lost all pre-booked and checked-in seats, sending the check-in queue into turmoil. I appreciate things happen, but Malaysia Airlines staff did nothing to help. No one came out to speak to passengers and say there was an issue. Families were all split up and those who hadn't checked in, were given the seats of those who'd done it weeks before. We spent 2.5 hours in the check in queue and the attendant was frustrated the customers were frustrated. Delayed 45 mins on outbound. No apology at all. - The A380 is 10 years old. Malaysia Airlines have made the interior look like it was 30 years old. Was dripped on by the aircon unit the whole flight to KL. Delayed 1.5 hours on return leg (managed to split up whole families and assign exit seats to 3 year old children and have new born babies travelling alone). Again no apology. Both legs people had seats back, blind and tables down and for take off and landing and no one checked seats belts. Staff aren't rude, they just don't care. On the return journey the staff spent 2 hours in one hit laughing and joking in one of the galley areas. Worst plane food, bar none. -Entertainment system kept breaking on the way back. Again, staff weren't even offering an apology and showed not interest in finding a solution (ideal for a 13 hour flight).";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-04-14;" | Mumbai to Jakarta via Kuala Lumpur. The ordeal with Malaysia Airlines started at Mumbai as the flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. It was fine as I got a message that flight is delayed and accordingly I planned my arrival at airport. The issue of my boarding pass took about 30 minutes as the I was checking in after the actual scheduled departure and they had closed the desks in the terminal. Why this was not re-scheduled is still a mystery. As I was worried about the connecting flight, I was assured by the staff that I shall get a connecting flight 3 hours later. The flight is 5 hours and the Business class seats are just a little better than economy as far as leg room is concerned. So in my cramped space I was sitting all the way five hours and dozing off as it was past midnight with no sleep. The crew never served breakfast. That was surprising and there were no amenities like toothbrush, etc. The second part was even more interesting. On reaching the transit counter, I was told that 2:00 flight is full and change is not possible. So I was offered a flight 5.5 hours later. Which again was delayed by almost an hour. The lounge is just functional and does not allow you to rest as their are no reclining seats. I was wondering why a transit hotel was not provided. I did not expect a better business class seat in short leg of 2 hours from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta. On board as I had booked special AVML meal I was told that no such booking exist. They had not transferred my preference in changed flight. So I remained hungry all the way. So over all I remained seated for 15 hours through the night and almost a full day with small snacks in lounge as I have special meal requirement. On landing my baggage was missing so I wasted half hour waiting on belt and then half hour to register the missing baggage. It was delivered next morning at the hotel which was some relief.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-04-12;" |  London to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Easy check in and nice lounge at Heathrow. Flight a bit late. Seats much more comfortable in A380 then I had read - full flat bed, a bit hard but easy to sleep and loads of room. Thin mattress and good duvet provided. Excellent food other then vegetarian option which was vegan and uninspired - chick peas served for both meals on way out and paneer the same on the way back. But very good flights. KL lounge is still very dated and worn out. A330 has slightly odd seat layout the single seats are great, the doubles ok unless you're in the window as there's little space and you need to be on good terms with your neighbour to get out. Neither food nor bed with thin blanket only nor service as good on Perth legs. Ground staff at Perth were poor, slow check in, lots of people seemingly doing nothing. No better at boarding. All four flights were near enough full. Seems the heavy discounting is at least having that positive effect. My fares were something of a bargain.";POSITIVE

Equipped with entertainment on board for each passenger. Lots of choices of movies. Was served with a choice of either Chicken Murtabak and Fish rice. I must say Malaysia Airlines has improved a lot on their food. Delicious meal. Air hostess was polite and attentive. Toilet was clean. We arrived Bali on time.

malaysia-airlines;2017-04-04;" |  Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok. Check-in was relatively smooth given the long queue. Boarding was a little unusual though, with window seat passengers called first for boarding ahead of other Economy passengers.  Legroom was a little tight during the flight, especially when the passenger reclined his seat and it made the personal space feel rather claustrophobic. This also made it hard to eat when the meals were served as the steward didn't even seem to care that the passengers in front had their seats down. Meal service was quick and efficient but the quality was ordinary. The steward seemed rather lazy during the drink service and was more interested in not serving the drinks.  PTV was working although the USB port on my seat and the seat next to me was not working. Experience worse when trying to put the seat upright for landing. The seat adjustment button got stuck and although the seat came back up, it would not lock in position. Had to sit for landing without putting pressure on the seat back. Overall, the aircraft was poorly maintained and crew not very hospitable nor caring. ";NEGATIVE

Aircraft itself is starting to look a bit shabby with plastic panels hanging off. Crew were ok but found it a bit bizarre on a morning departure from London that the lights were dimmed straight after food service. Biggest issue was lack of alcohol onboard, after 2 gin and tonics I was told they had run out and we were only 3 hours in to a 12 hour flight. I asked for a baileys instead and was told that was the last one. Totally unacceptable to pay a business class fare and not to be able to get preferred choice of drink for 9 hours of the flight.

The check in and lounge in London were great and I had a nice seat (although hard and uncomfortable when flat) Once we were airborn a faulty door seal resulted in an alarm sounding for over 3 hours. The crew carried on with the service despite there clearly being a fault. We circled over Amsterdam for about an hour while he captain tried to fix it. However no reassurances to the passengers or apologies or explanation of why we were circuling during the time the fault was evident. I travel frequently but this engendered severe anxiety and I've never wanted a flight to end sooner. The CSD was pleasant enough once he saw my and others passengers anxiety but the crew were really set on dishing out the alcohol and satay. There were other faults on the plane - lavatory lights not working in business class and seats and bowls filthy and scratched. Indifferent crew too. Some delightful others really rude.

Needless to say we arrived at KL early, with ampler time to make our connection to Doha and London on Qatar Airways. Much to our delight, we and our bags were checked through all the way to London, even though we had separate PNRs/tickets. This was a great touch from Malaysia Airlines, avoided by other One World carriers, except Qatar Airways. Cabin service was fine, though we declined the meal service because of the late hour.

I have to say that the flights: London to KL and KL to London, were half empty so the flight attendants and airport staff were quite relaxed and attentive. Luckily we did not queue for long at check in on both flights. At Heathrow the lady at check in was lovely, chatty and proactive. She advised us to be seated on the lower deck as she could find two seats on a row by ourselves. Boarding was easy and the flight took off on time. Same experience for our flight from KL to London. Everything was quick and easy. We used the Malaysia lounges on several occasions and they were all good (Heathrow one is the best though). The inflight services were good, the flight attendants offered water several times. Seats in economy are ok. Entertainment a bit old but still plenty of choice. One thing not good, toilets. It is not the fault of the flight attendants. The toilets need a good good cleaning from the contractors at the airport. They smell terribly and are uninviting. I cannot imagine the state of the toilets when the flight is full! The food served on board is ok, I have flown with other companies and frankly the food served on flights in economy are just average. The flight attendants were nice and polite, they followed up on our requests and served drinks several time during the duration of the flight. If you are kind and polite they are polite and helpful in response. One other thing that was poor about the Malaysia Airlines experience is their website. From my personal experience other airlines have a much better website. I booked via a travel agency so we got a very good deal, If I had to pay full price I might not have booked the holiday. We are also very thankful as we were upgraded to business on our flights KL Bali and return.";POSITIVE

Our overall impression was good. staff were professional and smiling, aircraft were clean with no apparent faults. Both sectors departed on time and arrived slightly early. Recliner leather seats in 2-2 layout are fine for short sectors. But, and it's a big but: Malaysia's policy of no alcoholic drinks on shorter sectors is lamentable. With so much low cost carrier competition in the region MH needs to do better to attract and retain premium passengers. Sub contractor check in staff at SIN were impolite and very lazy.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-02-24;" |  London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur. Totally disappointed. On my return flight from London, we had to wait for almost 2 hours standing in queue just for boarding pass to be issued. We are then served by unprofessional customer service counter staff.  Standing in the queue for 2 hours and with an elderly, makes everyone restless and tired especially its morning flight. We were told system are down and we will be allocated seats that we have chosen during online check-in. I make a request to just have my elderly mother to be seated beside my sister. It was turned down by him given the same reason as system are done.  Hence, we are seated separately. However, during queuing to board the plane I overheard a customer service lady staff telling a lady infront of us that she can only get her seats to be seated together with her partner if they have paid the additional cost for the seat tickets during booking.  I ask for it while its my turn but she told me a different story and it can't be done as the system are down. I was disappointed and proceed on as the given seats. The last draw that makes me write this review was that I found out that the whole row seats in front of me are taken up by a family of 6 or 7, which continued to the same row in the middIe seating.  I paid more to book an aisle seats, and my allocated are window seats. I will not be recommending Malaysia Airlines even if the tickets are cheap. Delayed flights in both London and KUL, back to SIN.

I booked under the name Alex, whereas my passport name is Alexander. I have done this a few times before and it has never been a problem, as it only takes 3 seconds for an employee to add 5 characters into a computer. I received a message from my agent saying Malaysia Airlines would not let me fly unless I paid a fee of £100 to add 5 letters onto my name. I spoke to Malaysia Airlines customer service who were nothing but rude and unempathetic about my situation. Whilst not only costing me an arm and a leg to add something so simple, it has ruined the last few days of my holiday trying to resolve the issue. ";NEGATIVE

The Golden Lounge in Melbourne Airport was old, one could possibly use the Qantas Business lounge due to One World alliance reciprocal privileges. There was only one entry to the aircraft so boarding passengers were slower. Upon boarding, pre-flight drinks were promptly served. After take-off, the satay was served and I maintain that this is one of the best satay I've ever experienced. My main meal was the Cod and Salmon duo - seared fillets of salmon and cod, accompanied with wasabi-infused mashed potato, baby carrots and lobster sauce. This was a pre-selected meal using Chef-on-Call service. I was satisfied and I didn't have dessert by choice. Inflight entertainment was good enough to keep me entertained. The seats transforms into a flat bed which is comfortable enough for a nap. The touch sensitive control panels for the seat is situated in an awkward location where my elbows will inadvertently make contact with them and unexpectedly move my seat. Storage space varies from seat to seat due to the asymmetrical arrangement of the seats. I was seated on aisle seat 2E. Cabin crew were attentive, professional and efficient. Upon arrival in KL international airport, the customs and immigration queue for Business Class passengers were so long because there was only one dedicated counter open at the time. All in all, I am happy with my flight, but there are certain things that can be improved, particularly the speed of boarding and clearing customs / immigration.";POSITIVE

Each seat was given a pillow and blanket, and the inflight entertainment was wonderful since there are a lot of movies to be chosen. Their cabin crew are very polite and professional, they served the meals with great care. Malaysia Airlines makes a great improvement in their inflight meal. The curry chicken was very tasty, compared with last time I flew with MAS. Cabin crew served a lot of choices of beverage, including red wine.

There are many movies on the inflight entertainment system, however it is hard to navigate through them. What really stood out from this flight were the cabin crew.

This was just the beginning of the poor correspondence, and eight weeks later I am still yet to have a single email or telephone call answered by them. I've tried telephone, email, facebook, and even twitter, and still not a single person has got back to me. Probably the worst service I've ever received.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-02-09; |  Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. After calling Malaysia Airlines weeks before the scheduled departure to add frequent flyer information and seating requests (due to being unable to add this information on there website) we had an interesting experience at check in. I was travelling with my partner and after confirming that we were seated next to each other in a 2-4-2 configuration It was a surprise to find the check in agent had moved us into completely different rows and seats. After receiving the boarding passes we raised this with the agent. He then informed us that there were no two seats next to each other available. After showing him the MAS seat selection confirmation he quickly changed his tone and put us in our original seats. This was truly puzzling. The flight was mediocre. IFE minimal and meals sub-par. I've felt MAS has slipped over the past couple of years.;NEGATIVE

Upon arrival from Tokyo Haneda proceeded to the transfer counter at KLIA satellite building. The staff was edgy and made no eye contact. Thereafter prior to boarding at gate B11 for MH2646 the boarding gate staff reluctantly attended to us. She was impatient with the 2 elderly passengers when they were quite slow in producing the documents. Inflight service was no better. Flight crew were rude and no interest in customer service and throughout the flight made it look as though they were simply forced to work. Food was inedible. Cabin looked tired and dirty. Toilets were no better. Overall the service on this domestic sector was not commendable at all. MH seriously needs to improve on the basic customer services skills if they ever want to be on top again. ";NEGATIVE

My first flight with Malaysia Airlines in 2 years, we were pleased with the service received from the cabin crew, they were very attentive at all times. The food has improved since my last flight and beverage service was fairly standard. Movie selection could be improved, poor choice of latest releases. Seats comfortable and good leg room. Maybe it's due to cut backs that you don't see any Malaysia Airlines uniformed staff at Heathrow, only the ground handling company who aren't overly interested in the customers.";POSITIVE

Check-in at a special counter with those silver / gold / platinum Enrich members. Entitled to enter MAS domestic golden lounge (newly renovated) with comfortable environment and nice food. The only setback was the front desk customer service person. Lack of smiles and eye contact. No greeting and just looking at his PC. While boarding, I was greeted by a senior steward by surname. I like the 42-inch seat pitch which gives a lot of space to stretch my legs. A hot towel, pillow and blanket were offered before departure. Enjoyed the meal but with limited choice due to late night flight. Overall, I quite enjoyed MAS business class. I brought the ticket during their promo fair. Worth a try.";POSITIVE

Smooth check-in and boarding at LHR-T4, morning-flight was about one-third full, and cabin crew were helpful in finding quieter seats so we could all spread out to sleep after take-off. Reasonable IFE selection, and food (chicken and cheesy-mash) tasty. The otherwise excellent A380 cabin was let down by the poor state of maintenance of the toilets - overdue for repair and a deep-clean! The full Boeing 737-800 hop up to Bangkok was very cramped, the box-food meal very basic, not something one would wish to repeat too often.";POSITIVE

Boarding was easy although the ground staff didn't seem to really give much attention to Enrich Gold, Business class travellers or family with children, senior citizens priority boardings. Everyone seemed to rush into the queue when boarding. Seated in a special side of the cabin, although it is only economy class there are only two rows in that cabin which I like, a little personal space and more privacy. Cabin crew were polite and friendly. They offer a choice of chicken and fish for dinner. I picked the fish which was boneless, well cooked and delicious. Malaysia Airlines were generous with drinks although they could have water on the tray. They do serve alcohol on this sector. Plenty of choices for the inflight entertainment and good content in the inflight magazine, Going Places. Overall very impressed with the improvement Malaysia Airlines has made. Looking forward to the next trip with them.";POSITIVE

I have not flown Malaysia Airlines for a long time and I am glad they have improved a lot since. Cabin crew is really friendly and showed the Malaysian hospitality. Seats were comfortable, I fell asleep few minutes after take off. Inflight entertainment has a wide variety to keep me entertained on a five-hour flight. New fresh look for Malaysia Airlines inflight magazine, Going Places as well. Although it is a little thinner than usual I love the new look. Food is delicious and quite a good portion for economy class. I had the omelette with spinach and baked potatoes for breakfast and they did not disappoint. No WiFi available on board. This flight has changed my perspective towards Malaysia Airlines (and it's for the good!). Already thinking maybe I should try flying from Perth to London with Malaysia Airlines in the near future.";POSITIVE

Flights on time, so even with only an hours transit time in Kuala Lumpur, there was amble time for a couple of drinks in the Golden (Regional) Lounge. Despite not serving alcohol on board for short and medium range flights there is plenty of it in the lounges they use. FA's onboard excellent. Small aircraft a bit noisy, aged, but well maintained. Out of 16 seats in business class, the load was low, 4 and 6 passengers respectively. In economy class, 2 of 3 seats were empty. True, classic, soft bolstered business class chairs (I love them!). No real IFE nor WiFi. Three choices of hot meal offered and they appeared not to ran out of any. Food fairly good, though had one dish which came out disappointing: a lamb cutlet turned out to be lamb stew in a sugary sauce, the staff tried to change it to another, but the same issue. Need to check the providers. No smoothies, no cheese, no ice cream, no chocolate, no amenities, no pens, no kid toys, no inflight sales. Earplug on demand. Earphones of very low quality. Wet towels and pre-departure soft drinks offered. FA in good mood, proactive, and very knowledgeable. The trip is definitely to 7 and we add one due to an incredibly competitive price of ticket. Thanks for the visit Malaysia Airlines. We’ll meet again.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-01-31;" |  Tokyo Narita to Perth via Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia Airlines is competent getting you from A to B, but they provide a much lower level of service than low cost carriers such as AirAsia. They moved our original flight time by a significant amount (from 0930 to 1945) (booked 9 months prior), causing our entire end-of-trip travel plans to be disrupted. We requested a refund for that flight as their services were no longer useful, and they denied the request on the grounds it was a multi-trip booking - a first indicator for poor service. It then took 4 separate phone calls to arrange a change in booking - the third time was only successful as we demanded to speak to a manager. The other major issue we have with the airline is that they served peanuts to every customer on the flight. This is one of the most common allergens, and of course it is also finger food. The result is that all of the seats and touch screens are covered in peanut allergen - ultimately causing my wife to have severe rashes over her body after all 4 of our flights with them in the past trip. We will not fly with them again, as they are more expensive than low cost airlines, but with a lower level of service.";NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2017-01-25;" |  Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur. An almost satisfactory flight. While the cabin crew were friendly and polite, and assisted with your needs, there were downfalls. I think Malaysia Airlines need to improve food. All the meals were quite tasteless. After a few bites it was hard to finish it at all. Placement was messy. I had an 'egg breakfast', and the eggs did not even taste remotely like an egg. It was plain, dry, and in need of a sauce of some kind. Drinks was overall pretty good. Boarding process: From the gate it was terribly messy, but once you stepped onto the airbridge everything was smooth. The ground staff in charge of boarding was not from Malaysia Airlines. Not clear in their instructions, which led to people travelling without children to begin rushing to board even if they did specifically say for travellers with young children. Inflight Entertainment was extremely slow to respond, and often needed to be pressed twice or thrice for the system to process the command. Not a very good music folder, and lacked songs from the charts. Kids were left disappointed with the lack of children's movies as well. Usually, I watch movies throughout the whole flight, no matter if it is a red eye flight, but this time, there just wasn't any movies with appeal, which lead up to me listening to the same music over and over and falling asleep to that. Apart from those downfalls, it was a pretty good flight overall.";POSITIVE

The check-in process was easy with the app, and I appreciated the convenience of checking in my luggage at KL Sentral. The plane was run by a 5 star crew. They were not only efficient, but also friendly, genuine and made me feel very welcome. I liked that they took the time to properly describe the food options, rather than just saying ""chicken or fish"". They made a few drink rounds. The couple in front of me had a baby, and the crew were diligently checking on them during the flight to make sure that they were ok and had everything that they needed. The aircraft was clean, including the toilets. The entertainment unit was ok, but nothing to shout about. All in all I was happy with the experience.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-01-19;" | Delhi to Bali Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. As this was a holiday with great expectations I booked Business Class with Malaysia Airlines. While booking, I had cheaper options from Malindo Air and a slightly higher price from Singapore Airlines but I decided to go ahead with MAS. Check in experience was good and welcomed with smiles. Counter staff explained that there was a 60 minute delay and promised updates will be passed on through lounge staff. Also received a call from MAS call centre about the delay and I was satisfied with the way I was kept informed. Waited at lounge until 22:00 with no update from staff (departure was meant to be 2125). I went to the gate only to find the flight is not ready and is rescheduled to 00:05. At 00:30 enquired with the counter staff about the revised timings and informed that it may take one more hour. We finally departed flight at 03:30 Hrs - a good 6 hour delay. Onboard at my seat (5A) to my utter surprise trash was not cleared from seat pockets and material from the previous flight and was removed by staff when asked. To my astonishment towels and welcome drink were offered to some passengers but not all (including me). More surprises in store for me on this flight. My call button was not working. TV remote not functioning. I called the supervisor from the service area to show all the defects and he blamed maintenance and communication systems. Due to this, even breakfast could not requested and for coffee I had to go to the service area and ask one of the staff. I requested information about my connection between KUL-DPS but none of the staff had any idea but assured me that I will be accommodated on the next available flight. On disembarking at KUL, MAS staff gave me a new boarding pass and made me rush to the gate as it was a short connection. On enquiring about baggage no one has any info but assured me it will reach my destination. Reached DPS waited at the baggage carousel for a good 45 min until the belt stopped. Went around to enquire at baggage services counter and after verifying and lot of internal discussion they asked me to wait as some baggage is coming in at 17:25. Now, being a Business Class traveller I feel I have a right to know whether my bags are loaded or not and it is the airlines duty to inform me of this and not to waste my time. After a good 75 min wait the staff say they will send my bag later once it is arrived.";NEGATIVE

The Sydney leg on the A330 was not as great, very cramped aircraft and small IFE screens so didn't bother using it. Food and service was good again though. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Would use and recommend Malaysia Airlines again but avoid routes on the A330.";POSITIVE

There has been an unfortunate drop in quality in the whole travel experience with Malaysia Airlines. On my flight from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur, I found the crew unfriendly and perfunctory. At times I found them condescending towards passengers. A request for a hot drink by my neighbour was met by a curt ""the seatbelt sign is on, and an announcement has already been made"" rather than a polite declination. The crew seemed more interested in talking amongst each other in the galley rather than checking on passengers (they were usually only seen around meal times). The toilet was in an unacceptable state from the start of the flight. The bits under the sink were broken and held together by duct tape. The floor was sticky the whole time. I don't think it was cleaned throughout the flight. The good thing about the flight was that the pilot was professional and communicated well to all the passengers. Our plane had a technical glitch and we had to wait on the tarmac for 2.5 hours. He updated us very regularly and kept us at ease. Other plus points were the cheap fares and that the check in process was a breeze using the app. I will keep flying with them because they are my only direct option, but I hope there will be an improvement in terms of crew friendliness and aircraft cleanliness.";POSITIVE

Very happy to see the aircraft was an A380 rather than a 787 and the flight and service were both very good. Plenty of legroom in economy (BA and Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787 economy legroom is a disgrace!) and food selection good with attentive cabin crew. Nice snack packs offered for mid-flight nibbles (cake, cheese and crackers, nuts). Aircraft interior a bit shabby which is surprising considering its relative youth. My only gripe would be the toilets. Unlike the other large Asian carries (e.g. Cathay Pacific, JAL, Singapore etc) no attention was given to the toilets by the cabin crew and they were definitely not clean even at the start of the flight and not serviced during flight. Twice I had to ask cabin crew for new hand towels and toilet tissues and I noticed others had to do the same. The toilets/washrooms are in dire need of a deep clean and through the the aircraft, things like loose trim and bits of tape holding light fittings in place really do need attention!! Apart from these niggles, a good flight and would happily fly again, possibly bring some spare toilet tissue though!";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2017-01-11;" |  We flew Malaysia Airlines from Jakarta to London return via Kuala Lumpur, because it was cheap. Leaving Jakarta was no problem except for no on-line check in facility. The return trip was a whole different story. We had to change dates - at a substantial premium - but that was our choice. The issue was seating. We always take a 2-seat option, window and aisle. That was not available on the new flight, but no one told us. When I came to check in online, I could not locate any reference to our seats, the numbers for which still appeared on the website to be in a 2-seat configuration. (The website is confusing if, like me and about 10% of males, you are color-blind, as one cannot distinguish between taken and free seats. Why colour code? – most airlines simply put a cross on taken seats.) We had now been arbitrarily allocated new seat numbers – window and middle - but I was still under the impression that we might be able to get the 2-seat configuration. I printed the boarding passes. My son then spent a considerable time on the phone to Malaysia Airlines in London (?) but could get no sense out of the person he spoke to. For most of the conversation, we were still being led to believe that there was a two-seat section, and were trying to retrieve our original seats. Then, Malaysia Airlines decided that there was no availability, as this A380 was different to the outbound one. An offer to pay for an upgrade was declined, but he claimed to have now reactivated our old seat numbers. At the airport, check-in was carried out by a very curt lady, who had no interest in the fact that we had confirmed seats on one document but different seats on the printed-out boarding pass. “The original seats are gone!” Then we came to our baggage. We were overweight (we always are) but for the first time ever in my experience, they insisted on including our carry-ons in our total weight and charging us for that. So we then had to leave the check in and go to another counter to pay. More problems. The check-in lady had indicated that each of our carry-ons weighed 18kg! I demonstrated to the excess baggage lady that I could lift both with one hand (I am 71 and no athlete) and so an 18kg weight seemed unlikely. After further delay, Malaysia Airlines kindly charged us for only one carry on, checking the other. I have been travelling internationally since the mid-60s. I can only remember ever being charged for excess baggage twice – no complaints about that – but for carry on? Throughout all this, I had been trying to check in to our connecting flight from KL to Jakarta. Neither the website, phone person, nor Heathrow check-in lady, nor gate service, could find us. Finally we were curtly told to sort it out in KL transit. Hardly reassuring, when we only had a one hour transit time. Malaysia Airlines KL transit were useless. First, they blamed Garuda, since it was a codeshare and told me to sort it out with them. I politely declined, as the contract was with Malaysia Airlines. if they subcontract, it was up to them to deal with their subcontractor. Then we were told that the Garuda flight did not exist - which was why we could not check in – and we were to be booked on a Malaysia Airlines flight an hour later - if there were seats. I insisted that they find us seats on that flight, and miraculously the non-existent Garuda flight reappeared. So we got home – in the overall scheme of things little of this matters – except that I will never fly Malaysia Airlines again. For an airline trying to rebuild a reputation, this is not the way to do it!";NEGATIVE

On 2nd January while flying MH192 departure time 21.00, I was told to park my scooter on the aerobridge and board the plane, which I did with my husband's assistance. They normally put it in the cargo section. the captain happened to see the scooter on the bridge and refused to load it for fear of the sealed lead acid battery blowing up. All the passengers were seated and waiting for take off. The negotiations between us, the captain and the ground staff took 1hr 30 minutes. Even after assuring him that I had travelled to Sydney in their own airline with the scooter on 9th and 29th December, he refused to allow it initially. Finally, a ground staff member showed him the manual for checking in electric scooters.

Check-in smooth. Gate not announced until 45 minutes before departure and was from a very remote gate through cumbersome and humiliating bus service – not very common in BKK. This gave an initial feeling going with a Low Cost Carrier. Business class full on first sector (12 of 16 seats taken) and much less on 2nd sector (4 of 16 seats taken). Onboard service fine and food was very good and tasty with three options. Lack of any alcoholic drinks for serving is a disaster that deprives MH a lot of potential customers. Smooth luggage handling. A very cheap business class ticket which was only slightly more expensive than direct routing with Bangkok Airways (in economy) - made me take the trouble to deroute myself through Kuala Lumpur.

Flights on time, airplane cabin clean but toilet not so clean - and no paper. Staff ok. Very generous baggage allowance if this is important to you. KLIA is showing its age now. klia2 - which Air Asia use - is much better. Immigration took 30 minutes, with half of the desks closed (arrived at 17:00 on a Friday).

The in-flight entertainment system was substantial and responsive. although the screen was a little small.

I found this rule to be utterly ridiculous as I was paying the full cash amount to upgrade. Besides, there were 4 options for the ""main dish"" so why bother getting an economy class meal instead of giving me whatever option's left from business class. The problem was not the meal itself, I could not care less if the meal is from business or economy. The problem was I felt singled out from the service and it really ruined the whole business class experience. Lounge was rather disappointing in terms of the food option and bathroom cleanliness. Onboard the cabin crew was friendly and attentive. However, I did notice that I was not addressed by name whereas the passengers around me were. And I was also not offered any drinks when I woke up, whereas the passengers around me were offered coffee when the cabin crew noticed they had just woken up. Overall, I found Malaysia Airlines to be very disappointing in the service aspect. My money will definitely go to other airlines as they will give me the ""full treatment"" as a full paying business passenger, whether I purchased the ticket up front or decided to upgrade at the last minute.";NEGATIVE

Seat very comfortable and very clean on arrival. IFE - It was okay could do with more movies that are currently out in the cinemas, good music choice and some good documentaries. Food was excellent, this was a night flight so soon after take off we were given a meal, I can't remember what it was now but it was tasty and a good portion. Free drinks on board made it a nicer flight as well. Staff were all excellent and very welcoming throughout the flight, not issue when asked if I could have an extra drink here and there.

The whole process from booking to the actual flying day was good except delayed on the outbound. The ground staff handling the delay was very unprofessional. Two hours delay in early morning flight especially for connecting passengers from long haul international flight is bad. Plus, the poor customer service added to the misery. The staff raised voice to customer asking for the delay flight. Changing gate without announcement and left it to passengers to constantly look at the screen for update. Other than that, the Malaysia Airlines staff were excellent. Especially the call center. Our tickets booked online and no notification on the website that our payment has gone through.

My wife and I paid for premium seats between KKUL and London, Row 39, paying an extra $100. On checking in we were placed in rows 72 and 78 for the MH2 leg. No explanation, or refund, has been forthcoming despite asking for refunds and lodging two complaints. After many requests we were provided with seats together next to the toilet. By far the worst long-haul flight we have ever undertaken. We have emailed numerous people in the hierarchy, without receiving a response to our requests for both an explanation and a refund. We upgraded to business class on the way home as we could not obtain a guarantee that our pre-paid seats (Row 39) were going to be available for the trip back to KL. Obviously Malaysia Airlines does not care about customer feedback or service. After numerous flights with them, at least ten in the previous twelve years, I have decided they are seriously lacking in customer service and will not fly with them again. They do not deserve my, or my families, custom. Their cabin staff are exceptionally helpful, but their back office staff are hopeless!";NEGATIVE

If you are very lucky the aircraft look fresh and clean, but very often their planes look tired. It worries me when it is difficult to hold your business class seat in an upright position as expected on departure/landing. Malaysia Airlines management decided that no alcohol will be offered in regional and domestic flights. I respect and understand that muslims don´t touch alcohol, but when I, a non muslim, travel on business class on an international route cannot have a glass of wine, I don´t appreciate it.  The last four segments I flew with Malaysia Airlines had a late departure - up to 1.5 hour. Next time I will use a low cost carrier to Malaysia, eg. Air Asia.

The meal was mediocre at best and has been one of the cost cutting measures by the airline. Entertainment selection was mediocre at best and the controls work rather intermittently or rather, a tad slow. The seat pitch was horrendous and comparable to those of a budget carrier, it just felt tight, Jetstar Pacific new aircraft has better seat pitch than them! Ground staff at KLIA were more interested in their own conversations than serving the passengers and it seems rather unprofessional. Upon landing, we had to wait for another gate as the gate that it was supposed to park at was still occupied by another MH aircraft.

We were misdirected to wrong queue in Phuket despite querying the instruction which meant we only just make the flight. The plane on the return flight, an A330, was not the most comfortable.

Nowadays whether one gets a new B737-800 or the older ones (but at the same premium MH ticket fees) is like a lottery when taking Malaysia Airlines. There was no IFE. I was in seat 5A and the magazine holder was broken. The same too for Seat 5B. literaly falling off at the hinges. The meal served was not good. The crew were pleasant and trying their best and the pilots did an excellent job of flying thru turbulence. Malaysia Airlines management crows regularly about how it has 'turned around' the airline, but unfortunately seem to be still turning with no end in sight to reclaim its position as a world class airline.

Seats on the upper deck are hard to come by so please book it in advance if you prefer them. IFE was good but I wish they had the variety that other airlines have. Landing was smooth and the choice of Terminal 4 is really good because it is not very busy. The outgoing flight back to KUL was also a breeze and the crew were once again on their toes the entire flight serving juices and water every hour and ensuring that we were comfortable.

Otherwise it would have been a horrible flight having to sit upright for 9 hours on a red eye. Entertainment system in newly assigned seats had an electrical short in the ear phone jack and kept cutting-out.

Cleanliness is poor, as you can see stains everywhere from the seat pocket to the window.  Meal was a big dissapointment, a plain ""roti canai"" with curry dhall as the condiment. Was served with juice and coffee few minutes later, but coffee was so mild it tasted like an instant coffee.

In flight entertainment could be improved by adding more asian choices and a subtitle option (instead of forcing either an Arab, Chinese or English subtitle on each movie). AVOD should also include other language interface such as Mandarin.

I covered the reverse trip one week earlier in business class which I pretty much enjoyed, used my frequent flier status to use business class check in however the whole process lasted over 1 hour! Not a major issue but over 1 hour to check in a 737 is pretty long. Security was pretty quick I was invited to use the lounge but due to the time spent checking in I didn't have time, boarding was better organised in to a full flight. Seat 29A on a new looking aircraft was comfortable enough service was good by a very friendly crew. Drinks and a small meal served on a 1hr 45min flight. Arrived KL on time with 2 hours transfer time I used the MAS Golden lounge again with my frequent flier statuswhere we had enough time for dinner & a shower. Lounge very busy but food on offer was actually pretty good. Boarding MH002 was organised seats 16G/H on the upper deck were comfortable enough with good recline and decent PTV screen, departed 30 min late once airborne dinner was served within the hour with a drinks run after dinner. A snack box was also given out. I managed 7 hours okay sleep on the 13hr 30 min flight. Breakfast served 2 hours out of Heathrow which was also good for economy. Arrived T4 on time.

malaysia-airlines;2016-11-08;"Flying many times with Malaysia Airlines, have always been a satisfied customer. This time, it was even more worth mentioning because of the special upgrade. I travelled to Kuala Lumpur to meet an old friend on their very special economy class ticket. Outbound on an 737, I must admit the economy seat was a bit cramped, lucky a small lady was next to me, but the service and food was fine. Inbound, I was not eligible for their MH upgrade offer online because the class of my ticket (N), I inquired at check in, I was told that in exactly 2 hours before the scheduled flight time, one can get to the ticket office to arrange for a ""last minute"" upgrade, should there be seats available. Luckily, there was plenty, being a big aircraft (seasonal). It only cost me MYR590 one way, a real bargain. A new biz class boarding reissued. The only conditions were of course no extra mileage accrual, plus I will only be served economy class meal, but the rest is biz class. Come time for boarding, I was given priority. When in the air, here's what I got: Welcome drinks (including alcohol), hot towels, newspaper, their signature satay, after dinner hot drinks and desserts. The meal was from economy, but served on a nice tray with table cloth, metal cutlery and all the rest, you would hardly notice you're eating an economy meal. The cabin crew were very attentive to me, they were fascinated with the low price of my upgrade, and treated me with the same attentiveness and kindness just like any other Biz class passengers. I think, one of the key issue here is to be polite to them at all times, cabin crew normally will appreciate that, and don't mind to go extra mile to provide service. I was very impressed with the whole experience, plus the occasional use of a larger plane. Rest assured, MH really does make an effort and still a great airlines to fly with.";POSITIVE

Boarding through gate 6B was organised, and seat 16H at the rear of the upper deck business class cabin was okay. It's not the 1-2-1 offered on many airlines although it has plenty of room and I personally found the seat comfortable. The IFE was okay although the map wasn't great but otherwise okay, the aircraft itself was also a bit run down and probably due an upgrade. Service was great from a friendly pleasant crew, the food comprised dinner, a mid flight snack and breakfast, which was well presented and tasted pretty good. Arrived KUL 20 min early, used the MH satellite lounge which was pretty busy at 7am, breakfast and drinks available - although like the aircraft the lounge could do with a makeover. Boarding the flight to Phnom Penh a bit chaotic through gate G10, seat 1F on a clean looking Boeing 737-800.

The carpet in business class was threadbare in places leaving the undercover exposed. Doors to seat side cabinets didn't close. The seat itself was dirty and clearly a thorough cleaning of the surrounds had not taken place because when I fully reclined the seat a plastic bag fell out, and so too a ripped up customs declaration form along with some other debris. Food choices were limited and on the KL to Melbourne leg they had already run out of one of the main course before they got to me. Despite being in business class. My business class seat on the KL to Melbourne leg was in the middle row leaving a ridiculously tight fit for my legs once the seat had been fully reclined to a bed. In order to exit the 'bed' you had to bring the seat back to the upright position in order to be able to swivel your legs out from the little nook in which they sat when lying down. Entertainment choices were sparse and the selection of ""Latest Releases"" was hilariously small. Staff were earnest in their attempts to offer a professional service but there were mishaps and mistakes. The check ins at both London and Melbourne was not with out incident. London took over 50 minutes for business class which must be some sort of record. In Melbourne on the return leg I was told ""I am logging off as my shift has ended so try the next counter"". That's a first in my many years of travelling for business. The lounges in Melbourne and London offer the bare necessities whilst the KL Lounge was more befitting that of HQ as it should be. I can see why they offer fares at a discount to the major airlines. They need to in order to attract the clientele and your experience is a discounted one.";NEGATIVE

The lack of alcoholic drinks available for the BKK-KUL sector, which is a big fault in my view. Golden regional lounge in KUL is good with showers, views, and spas. Aircrafts were almost full. Food onboard OK but not top class. IFE is OK, but not of my main interest. Worse is lack of ice, cheese, smoothies, booze, or other refinements.

All 4 flights were on time, carried out by ageing, fuel-demanding, and noisy B737-800 – all were well maintained, though. OW elite card respected and generously rewarded a lot of miles for these 4 flights. Service onboard was absolutely fine. Food was generally good – at 3 or 4 star level. The alcohol ban for MH on regional flights (less than 3 hours, but not always consistent) shows and obviously hits hard for several passengers – especially on the evening flights. As the KUL-MNL-KUL legs was more than 3 hours duration, alcohol was available but only discretely served on specific demands. There was no wine list - only soft drinks appeared on menu cards. Only on the long leg on the way back, MNL-KUL, a wine list were provided. Pre-departure drinks offered and, on the 2 long legs, even champagne was offered. Seats are old, classical, soft business class with extended recline – perfect for medium haul flights. A good airline though recent cost saving measures appear.

First time on an A380 and was looking forward to this, it is a sea of people on the lower deck and the seat advise would be to fight for an economy seat in the upper deck. Back to my trip, IFE screen was good size with USB outlet, viewing selection was very good and i could find something to watch all the time (13 hours) flight tracker was a bit dated. Times must be hard at Malaysia Airlines as the inflight pack was non existent, blanket, pillow and headset, no socks, eye shade, toothbrush anything and after 13 hour flight my mouth tasted like, well not pleasant. Seat was the most comfortable I have experienced, it reclined in such a way it made it relatively easy to get a sleep and be at ease for this duration. Cabin crew were very very efficient they did the rounds like a rash they were warm enough to feel served by them it was a well run ship so to speak. Meals and snack box were good as was the regular hydration runs. I enjoyed the A380 experience it does really feel more relaxing and hope Airbus will seriously think about its future rather - the down side to this trip was out of Malaysia Airlines control due to ATC in Europe we sat in Heathrow for 2 hours. 2nd Leg to Kuala Terengganu, B738, haven't been one of these for years but MAS have decked them out pretty well with IFE and leather seats, 45 minutes a bag of peanuts and a drink and we were there, however due to a short, less than 20 minutes transfer time our bags didn't make it, now this is the rub, would you rather make the transfer and not get your bags or want to have a night in KL and travel with your bags after 3 couples dealing with MAS in Kuala Terranguna for over an hour I think I would travel with the bags.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-22;"London to Penang via Kuala Lumpur. Had 4 flights with Malaysia Airlines in 3 weeks, not one of them took off on time, the delays were between 40 minutes and 2 hours and each time we were boarded onto the plane only to sit there and wait all this time. So on the flight out of London we had been on the plane almost 3 hours before we were offered a drink. On all flights I found the staff unhelpful and uninformative. They offered no advice about missed connections on the way out and on the way back my TV stopped working 3 hours before we landed, I informed the crew and they didn't do anything at all. There was a huge mess up with seating on the way back, despite booking my seats online well in advance, upon check in they tried to put me be my husband on opposite sides of the plane. Similar things had clearly happened to other people as it was mayhem on board with people trying to move around, families being split up etc and the staff were less than useless. Getting a drink on an Malaysia Airlines flight is almost impossible, they came around with a tray of water or juice 3 times in a 14 hour flight and only did a proper drinks cart once. They don't put a menu out so at meal time you get a choice of chicken or fish and haven't got a clue what comes with them, it's like feeding time at the zoo, the staff are so unorganised! Never again, worst airline I've flown long haul with!";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-16;"In March I flew on the flight MH002 (Kuala Lumpur to Lo9ndon) which diverted to Manchester. It was a nightmare which ended with 14 hours delay, 5 of which were spent sitting on the tarmac.  Like anyone I was prepared to bitch and moan. However, something happened to restore my faith in the airline. I received a letter from the CEO of the company offering me a free flight. Wonderful! Well, no actually because once I tried to book my free flight using the instructions on the letter I came across a wall of evasion and obstruction. I have had several pointless phone calls and sent many unanswered e-mails. I have encountered the worst customer relations imaginable and still no flight. What should have been a simple process has become a game of smoke and mirrors. Is it wearing me down? Yes it is. Am I giving up? Not likely. I'll soldier on. It's become a matter of principle now. So, in conclusion, don't trust a word Malaysia Airlines tells you and use a different carrier.";NEGATIVE

When the agent picked up the call disconnected before I could explain the reason for my call. This happened twice - it's not possible to add baggage I'm told? You have to pay it as excess - $600 USD for a 20kg bag. Inflight, there are far too many announcements, telling you lots of useless information. The entertainment system is turned off an hour before landing? Next time I'll pay more to use another airline. On the plus side, the staff were very friendly and attentive.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-10;" |  At the time of booking with Malaysian Airlines and unlike other Oneworld alliance partners it is not possible to ascertain the fare class being booked and therefore the miles and points to be awarded to your frequent flyer program. I made a seamless round trip reservation from Singapore to London with a stopover in Kuala Lumpar. At the check in Singapore when I was given my boarding passes for both legs I asked if my miles had been credited and was assured that that was the case. The same scenario applied to my return trip. Upon my return and having retained the relevant boarding passes I made various online checks to my account to see if the miles and Cathay Pacific points had been credited to my account. On 08/07/16 the miles corresponding to the short leg from Singapore to Kuala Lumpar were credited but since then there has been no activity. I made an initial enquiry with Malaysian Airlines on 29/07/16 and subsequent follow up on 19/08/16 to which I have received zero response. On 19/08/16 I contacted Cathay Pacific in relation to the missing miles. I received a call from Hong Kong less than two hours after having sent a fax. I was informed that they would be following up with Malaysia Airlines with regards to the missing air miles for the Kuala Lumpar to Singapore leg but as the fare class indicated on the Kuala Lumpar to London and return boarding passes was different to the short Singapore to KL leg I was not entitled to any air miles. I have since contacted Malaysia Airlines yet again but to no avail. For passengers looking to accrue air miles and points if applicable in order to maintain their tier status, check carefully when booking with Malaysia Airlines as there is no indication when booking as to any entitlement. Moreover the fare class is not even stated on the travel itinerary receipt. I should also add that the price I paid for my return ticket from Singapore to London was no cheaper than those offered by other One World partners yet they all offer air miles. As for the actual flights I was not impressed with this carrier. The service was lacklustre, the food average and the A380 craft were showing their age. It also proved difficult to be served an alcoholic drink. The connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore left two hours after the scheduled departure.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-08;" |  Now I totally understand why MH has lost its 5-star rating. We flew business class from Kuala Lumpur to Denpasar on MH715. Equipment is an old Boeing 737-800 which is totally acceptable for a short 3-hour flight however the cabin was filthy and shortly after boarding.  Having flown with Qatar Airways and Cathay Pacific the previous day, Malaysia Airlines food, service and hard product is nowhere near in comparison which was a huge let down. The nearly inedible breakfast was served in a single tray by flight attendants who pretty much disappeared after putting the tray down with the exception of one flight attendant who was chatting with what I can understand a colleague, seated right across the aisle, with her fiance, getting married in Bali. The conversation started as soon as we boarded and continued during meal service and not once I noticed this flight attendant serving other passengers except chatting to her colleague while continually topping up their alcoholic drinks. Meanwhile we, and other passengers, have to ask for a coffee or juice as not once either of these were offered. From the point-of-view of a revenue passenger, this it totally unacceptable. We were looking forward to a great flight with MH but had very negative views of the airline after this unpleasant experience.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-06; |  Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. I flew this carrier due to the competitive pricing for this route. I was pleasantly greeted with nice cabin crew who helped me with my baggage. The plane took of a minutes later but landed on time at KLIA. The counter staff doesn't really smile much and the seats are old and the seat pockets are stained.  I often opt for the seafood and it taste good but not worth a second mention. Now they use the box like a bento and serve the food which I find is much faster to clear than the standard trays. The portions were good for a 1 hour 30 mins of flying time. Using an old IFE but it didn't have and issues. Overall it was a good experience if you paid for the lower end of the price as it can't match Thai or SQ quality service. Minimal service but the crew did the best. A practical choice for those who want to flight full service in economy in the region.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-04;" |  Ho Chi Minh City to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. For the SGN to KUL, the plane came in on time and departed on time. Cabin crew were professional and smiled but were visibly tired. Food was average to good, served hot from the oven into a box which I think is easier to clean rather than using a tray. IFE is not responsive but the console was able to counter the issue. Mid flight the cabin crew went down to close all the window shades to allow passengers to get some shut eye and offered pillows and blankets and drinks. The downside of departing from SGN is that the ground crew from SGN are poor in customer service as they are mostly locals and that the airports reputation was known to be poor in their airport rating in 2015. However the next leg, KUL to SIN, was a bit messy as the plane was delayed 45 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft from Tawau. So I arrived in Singapore at 0050h instead of 0005h. As a form of compensation the crew surprised us with ice cream onboard along with peanuts and juice which left us feeling better. Overall it was a pleasant flight but again the cleanliness is still not up to spotless just yet.";POSITIVE

Since a few months back, all flight services under 3 hours have removed their bar service which was a bit of a downer as we could not have a wider range of drinks to choose from. But the cost cutting measures seem to be working as the air tickets I bought were comparable to budget carriers flying out of KLIA. The flight was smooth and boarding was efficient due tot the low volume as it was an odd time to fly. Cabin crew was experienced and was able to comfort passengers, allowing them to feel a relax by providing pillows and blankets. They were fast to respond to the request and would kneel down to listen to your request in a kebaya which is quite a feat. They crew were lovely but the cleanliness of the aircraft, was poorly maintained. When queried about the cleanliness, I came to understand that the previous flight suffered moderate turbulence thus tea and coffee stains were everywhere. Overall I think they did their best to clean before the next set of passengers came onboard. It was an average to a good experience.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-09-03;" |  Singapore to Kuala Lumpur flight quality was moderately good. Not too shabby, the usual peanuts and juice was offered. Drink services were offered twice for a 40 minute flight. Newspapers were offered and the cabin crew would offer to collect your coats and store it in the closet. Pretty standard service. Kuala Lumpur to Ho Chi Minh City flight was bumpy and turbulent probably due to the pick up of the monsoon season but the pilots manage to keep it steady. Meals were of good portion if you considered that the plane was only in the air for 1h 30 mins. A simple seafood fried rice or chicken murtabak was offered with a choice of orange or apple juice - the food choice would be better if they had one western dish and one local as I find that it might be hard for others to appreciate the food. The cabin crew were doing a great job and were very attentive and offered pillows. The seats were normal standard and the space was decent. There is an issue about the IFE as the screen is not as responsive to touch but that can be countered by using the remote which was very responsive. The downside is that the plane was not very clean. But overall Malaysia Airlines still lives up to a full service flight. Occasionally there will be very cheap offers provide each month on certain routes that make the return trip cheaper than the budget carriers but you just have to transit at KUL.";POSITIVE

A few people ahead of us had issues with their visas/passport and I guess the security officer had no idea what to do. There was no sense of urgency. Then the computers froze up for about 10 minutes. Our flight started to board and my partner went to speak to someone who told us ""it's fine, just keep waiting,"". After the first security check, there was another for luggage. Absolutely no one seemed to care. We ran to the gate and obviously late - the woman was horrible. I explained the situation and her response - you should know it's peak time and you should get to the airport early. The plane was fairly empty and I saw luggage being taken off which makes me believe people missed that flight. There was a family right at the end of one of the security lines going to London - who had gone up to speak to staff working there but was refused fast track. The plane food was disgusting and rarely was water/drinks offered. Food was served after departure and then 2 hours before landing. I wouldn't travel on Malaysia Airlines again. ";NEGATIVE

AVOD is fine with touch screen (no games though). 737 large recliner seat is quite comfortable, really ok for a 3 hour flight like this one.The crew are very hard working and sincere. I arrived an hour late (due to HK airport heavy traffic control, not MH fault). Ground staff were waiting at the gate to assist me, new boarding pass issued and put on next flight. My emerald status with ONE WORLD afforded me entry to MH first class lounge. Fabulous food, service and everything, turned the delay into delight.

We had to seek out information about when the new departure time was, the only person manning the Malaysia airlines office said the aircraft would depart at midnight, that was an estimate made 4 hours ago, he has now gone home while we are all still stranded. We haven't seen anyone work on the aircraft for the past 3 hours and it's been parked with its cargo door open, abandoned the whole time, there is not one Malaysia Airlines representative in the terminal and at the moment we are supposed to leave in an hour and a half, that's what we were told 4 hours ago. No apologies or reimbursement has been offered for missing connecting flights, regardless of carrier or to put us up in a hotel or pay for food.

The food was very nice and I enjoyed my special meal, and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. What I did not enjoy is the fact the interior of the aircraft was dated, dirty and needed a good clean. In the seat pockets there were sweet wrappers and on the tray table coffee stains from the previous flight. On the Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow sector of our journey I experienced an allergic reaction to the blankets provided. My arms began to swell up and become itchy and covered in a rash which was pretty uncomfortable. I went to the galley to ask one of the crew if I could have anti allergy tablets, but they said they do not carry these tablets on board and offered me paracetamol and ice to put on the rash. Having worked for a couple of airlines myself I was pretty taken back by this response as for the airlines I've worked for anti allergy tablets are pretty standard. Plus I'm not quite sure what paracetamol would have done for an allergic reaction. I had to endure another 9 hours of itching and general discomfort which could have been avoided should the airline have had these standard allergy tablets. ";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-06-08;" |  What made this flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore enjoyable was the cabin crew service. The warmth of the Malaysia Airlines cabin crew in my opinion is the friendliest in the region. A nice touch on this flight was that they served ice-cream bites. It was only an hour long flight, and typically all I get on such flights is peanuts and juice, so the ice-cream as a pleasant surprise. Overall, a pleasant experience. ";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2016-05-31;"Adelaide to Phuket with Malaysia Airlines. I have flown with Malaysia Airlines on several occasions - including twice from Adelaide to Paris with my wife in Business Class. We joined their loyalty program (Enrich) so that we could use the points from all our work and holiday trips to upgrade later flights. Next September (2016) my friends and I are going to Phuket and I have tried countless times to get the return trip upgraded using my Enrich points. Without exaggeration, I have called the Enrich number 12 times. On a number of these occasions I was lucky enough to be able to leave my contact telephone number and get a call back. On these occasions I was told my request was in a queue and that I would need to ring back on a certain date - which I did. Every Malaysia Airlines representative I've spoken with has told me something different. For the last 3 days I can't leave my return number on a ring-back because their recording doesn't seem to be working now. When I ring the complaints line - the line gets automatically cut off. Malaysia Airlines was very eager to take my money for Business Class tickets for my wife and me and for a number of other work and holiday trips to/from Malaysia - but not very happy to provide me with an upgrade using the Enrich points I've earned. My advice - joining Enrich is a waste of time and money. Their representatives (when you're lucky enough to be able to get through) don't speak English very well and, even though they make promises, nothing is done. Fly with an airline that values its customers.";NEGATIVE

On board, a nice welcome from a member of staff but after that, it was all perfunctory and not very friendly. Staff seem to be more interested in finishing up their service quickly and disappearing into the galley. The seat was one of the new business class seats. These seats really confuse me. Why not use the herringbone arrangement instead of those large and bulky storage areas beside the seat? I would have preferred more seat width and less storage area. The seat controls were not working very well and the seat kept going into recline mode as I kept hitting the button accidentally. Some genius located the panel at elbow level! When the seat lies flat, you are cocooned in a little pit which makes you feel like you're in a coffin as the seat sinks well below the arm rest. Badly designed seat which is better as a recliner than a flat bed. The food was noting to shout home about. The tray table was abysmal in size and all meals were served on a tray. The pillow is a small, thin square which is not very supportive. Is it worth the money? I do not think so. I found my outbound trip on AirAsia X Premier seat more comfortable and better for sleeping, although it was an angle flat seat.";NEGATIVE

Due to an electrical problem out scheduled 21.50pm flight was cancelled after we had all boarded. This required a change of plane meaning all luggage and passenger meals had to be changed. Our flight finally took off about 2am. I think all involved handled the situation professionally. A lot of negative things are said about Malaysia Airlines but I have flown with them since 1999 and always enjoyed the experience. The only minor thing I would like to see are newspapers for all flights - reading the magazine 4 times is quite boring. ;POSITIVE

Check in at KLIA wasn't a particularly premium experience although it was better than for economy class where the queues were horrendous. The lounge is decent with a good range of food and drinks. Boarding was on time and easy as business class was less than half full. Overall the flight was fine and the service was efficient and polite although lacking any real warmth. The meal service was slightly odd. I had used the chef on call option and the first serving was fine but later one of the FAs told me that they no longer did a second full meal service (on a 13.5 hr flight in business class!) and that I had to choose something from what looked like a snack menu but then later they brought my chef on call order out anyway. Bit confusing. The seat is comfortable and turns into a fully flat bed. Arrived at Heathrow slightly ahead of schedule.;POSITIVE

The fried rice that was served on the KL to BKK route was the worst I have ever tasted. I think I will stick to flying budget airlines where I have some control over the choice of meals. The sandwich served on the return flight was marginally better. I had the same aisle seat on both flights - the older plane to BKK had more leg space but no IFE. The new plane on the return journey had a good selection of movies and music, but leg space was a lot less due to it having a broad black metal support. The middle seat on the other hand had more legroom.";NEGATIVE

After she gave me lounge invitation, I headed to a very decent SATS lounge. Finished my lunch, I go to the boarding gate only to be found my flight was delayed. The station manager said, the inbound aircraft couldn't land in SIN due to adverse weather and landed in nearby JHB. Passengers were given food voucher and only to come at the gate after 2 hours. I headed back to SATS lounge. After 2 hours, the aircraft still cannot be seen and station manager assured the flight will be landing in another one hour. He keep on updating us and told me the paperwork complexity when the flight rerouted. Aircraft arrived 1.5 hours later. The captain and cabin crew apologise the delayed incident. I was offered small pack of nuts and juice. I found that Malaysia Airlines has removed hot beverages on this route.  Overall, everything was fine, check-in agent fantastic and communication by the manager was great. ";POSITIVE

Good selection of IFE movies but the headphones are of poor quality and thus ruins the experience. Flight Kota Kinabalu to Kuala Lumpur at 5pm was a different story. Ground staff were very good - managed my request for a stand-by for an earlier flight well - and so were the cabin crew. The aircraft was a leased B737-800 - tired, no IFE etc. Then they served something that was an insult to Malaysia - something called a Fish Noodle (only choice by the time it got to the back row of the aircraft). MH as an airline is undergoing a restructuring and I am confident it will turn around. However its food, if one were to be generous and use the term food, is an insult to Malaysia as a nation.";NEGATIVE

Inflight they came around with peanuts and drink service. One FA thought it was perplexing for me to request a Fruit Spritzer a mix of ice, Sprite and Apple juice (which was not on the drink menu). I guess it was too much for her to handle. For dinner I had spicy fish kung po with noodles. It was very tasty. Nearing arrival, we were offered a small snack in a box. There was no water service after main meal,  but FA responded very quickly to my bell call. The plane felt new and it was clean. A few rows down from me someone was taken ill and cabin crews showed great compassion through their speedy service.  Cabin announcements were clear and frequent - an emphasis of safety which I like.

malaysia-airlines;2016-04-06;" |  I've been flying Malaysia Airlines whenever possible, usually to KL, Jakarta, Bali and Brunei, and have a developed a loyalty towards this beleaguered carrier through its tough years. In the recent past, it has served up a good business class product, offering discounted prices you can't find elsewhere, but lately the quality of service has started to deteriorate. for starters, the flights I take most often are Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur return for which MH schedules 7 flights in each direction. Yet, there's not a great level of reliability on these actually flying, as I've discovered. Malaysia Airlines sometimes cancels some of these on short notice if the loads are light and then they seek to combine flight loads. Today was one such case. So my 5:10pm flight cancelled less than 24 hours out and I got an email from MH telling me that I was rebooked on the 6.40pm flight to KL - so my plans for an evening meeting in KL were scrapped. We've all seen the wide-body aircraft taken off the regional routes (today's use of an A330 on this flight was a rare exception) and ""meals"" in Economy have become boxes while offerings in Business Class have become less remarkable. But today, I discovered that Malaysia Airlines has suddenly stopped serving any form of alcoholic beverage on its regional flights under 3 hours in duration, even in business class! This is really too much. I asked cabin crew for the story behind this, and they empathized, noting that it was a crazy management decision announced without any consultations with staff. So, no more wine or champagne on the flights to Bali, no beer at the end of a hard day of Jakarta meetings. This seems to be a great way to drive away business. SQ, TG, and Garuda will be glad to have it!";NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2016-04-01;"Auckland to London Heathrow via Kuala Lumpur. Having flown similar routes to Australasia on 4 previous occasions I have a benchmark by which I can judge others. Malaysia Airlines was my worst experience to date. The cabin crew were efficient at best, but lacked any personal attributes. No smiles or personal interaction. The males were particularly surly/arrogant. The food was poor, lacking choice and imagination, similar meals being served for lunch and dinner. Noodles, Rice and Chicken seemed to be the mainstay. Onboard entertainment was very American based, eg Comedy TV was all American series which otherwise would never make it outside of the USA. Films were nearly all American. The outward flight from London left at 21:15 which led to a sunrise some 4/5 hours later. During this dark period a dinner was served and when finished the cabin staff asked for all window shades to be closed and the cabin lighting was switched off. Fine for a few hours shut eye, but the cabin remained in darkness most of the daylight hours and was not lit until 2-3 hours before arrival in KL. Whilst I realise that many people would sleep my preference is to get into local times as soon as possible and would have preferred the cabin to be in the afternoon mode. During this enforced darkness the cabin crew were noticeable by their absence. Our return flight departure from Kuala Lumpur was delayed by 30 minutes but our arrival in Heathrow was 60 minutes late. At no point was any apology or explanation given by the flight crew. The delay caused great anxiety due to the need to catch onward transport. In the event I caught my coach with just two minutes to spare.";NEGATIVE

However, it proved very difficult to engage with the crew in any way. The food was acceptable but nothing special. The only alcoholic pre-dinner drinks served on all flights was cans of Carlsberg larger, which leaves a lot to be desired. During our meals there was a choice of red or white wine. The best part of our flights was the inflight movie selection, which was very good and included many recently released films.

malaysia-airlines;2016-03-25;" |  London to Denpasar via Kula Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines. Normally flying long haul on economy class on A380 is preferred to Boeing 777 or 747 due to its larger cabin size and newer size but this aircraft was filthy. For example the tray-table smelt of sick and I had to clean it myself using antiseptic wipes and the toilet extractor was clogged with grime. Despite this grievance the flight was smooth and most passengers had spare seats next to them as it was half empty. Entertainment including power points and well stocked magazine rack was excellent, food was decent for economy - I had chicken tikka and rice. The staff were nice but a bit lethargic and they looked sad, almost depressed - I can't blame them after all that has happened over last few years. The advantage of connecting at KL is that there is light airport traffic makes it a breeze and you don't have to go through unnecessary security checks like you do with a middle east carrier. Unfortunately my baggage didn't arrive but it was sent to my hotel a few hours later.";POSITIVE

Before boarding the plane, the ground crew keep delaying the boarding by saying Business Class first, then family with small children, then row 17 to 30, then only reach my turn (I was seated at 7A). Once I board the plane, I can see the plane is old and dirty. The seat legroom is very small. There was no inflight entertainment. But I can praise check in staff and cabin crews.

Our problem is their change to their Enrich Scheme which now requires more points than most airlines to redeem. Further, as Brisbane is no longer served we have to fly at our own expense to Sydney which substantially increases travel time. To be fair their cabin crew is still probably second to none. However you can note the subtle cost cutting. On the night flight from Delhi to Kuala Lumpur only a very thin ""blanket"" was provided. It did not even keep you warm. No amenities kit provided. Yet the following daytime flight to Australia provided not only the kit but a padded blanket and padded seat cover. Only one run of alcohol before lunch, no further alcohol was served or offered.

Overall the experience was positive. The check-in process was smooth and the seats in the upper deck of the A380 were perfectly comfortable, and the entertainment system adequate. On the upper deck it is worth requesting a window seat for the storage bin alone - all your requisites can be kept within easy reach for the duration of the flight. The food was better than I expected. The one major criticism I have is that on the Heathrow - KL leg (A380) at least one toilet was out of action, leading to queues. Those working were pretty disgusting, but that is down to the passengers causing the mess. I returned from Melbourne (A330 and A380 respectively), and on the A380 leg the plane had a total of just 79 passengers and 21 crew, allowing those of us in economy to create a bed from 4 empty seats. The airline must have made a huge loss on this flight. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful, even finding me and remembering my name and vegetarian meal request when I moved seats (if fact I moved from the upper deck to the lower one).

Dessert was a slice of mango cheese cake which was stock standard fare as compared to the excellent red velvet cake served on the ADL - KUL leg.

The only saving grace was that on the journey to Sri Lanka from KL we were placed on a Sri Lankan airlines flight which was the opposite experience to Malaysian. 2 suitcases left in KL on the return journey to Sydney just topped off a more than mediocre performance. Staff in the majority were unhelpful but did come across one individual who seemed slightly interested in their job. Food disgraceful even by airline standards, served curry for breakfast at 9am on departing flight, only presume it was the curry from what should have been the original evening departure. Departed Sri Lanka at 1am and served curry at 2am followed by a frozen egg roll at 7pm just before arriving at Sydney, absolutely zero thought given catering, I have never seen so many food trays returned untouched. Water pretty much non-existent on all legs of the journey unless of course you wanted to walk to the galley and help yourself. Aircraft in very poor condition, seat covers coming off, entertainment units not working, tape holding things together in the bathrooms, not cleaned at all during any of the flights.

Last night on a return flight Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur I was told no wine with meal as ""the flight is shorter than three hours"". Its difficult to see how this cost saving is going to win business class clientele. It may seem a minor issue to senior management, but as a consumer and as a business owner, perception is consumer reality. Perception is that Malaysia Airlines isn't interested in maintaining their business clients.

My suitcase didn't arrive because it was supposedly checked through to Mumbai. So I had to shop for more clothes and needed to pay for 2 more meals. During this time I phoned both numbers of lost baggage dept multiple times and there was never a reply to either line. Finally the hotel managed to get through and were told my bag was ready to board connecting flight to Mumbai. Upon arrival, (one hour late) into Mumbai, my baggage did not show. One hour later, I had to fill in another lost baggage claim and consequently waited 3 more days without my bag. During this time I could not get through to anyone on the lost baggage line and was never contacted about my bag. Finally, an Indian lawyer friend called the airline on a different line and proceded to tell them how disgusted we all were with the lack of service and care. The bag was found sitting in KL with an excuse that it was my fault that I filled out two lost baggage claims! There has at no time, been any contact to me, let alone an apology or offer to compensate for expenses incured during this time.

The second meal service was better. My only real complaint on this sector was that the January movies hadn't been loaded (on 4/5 January) so there was exactly the same selection as in December which was a bit feeble.

malaysia-airlines;2015-12-10;Singapore to Sydney via Kuala Lumpur. We travel annually on Malaysia Airlines to Europe. This was our homeward leg. The airline has had its difficulties and has been restructured. If anything service and food are even better. Downside is that many routes have been dropped including KUL to Brisbane. This means we now must fly out of and into Sydney which adds five hours to the trip. Seat becomes an angled bed. This to change I believe early next year to a flat bed.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-12-09;"Short flight with Malaysia Airlines from MYY to KCH, however very disappointed with its quality. Feels like flying with a budget airline. Seat condition (leather) was poor and dirty. Seat pocket seems oily with dirt on it. Poor air conditioning, it was far too hot during the flight. Problems with the IFE. Conclusion: Malaysia Airlines really need a lot of improvement.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-12-09;"I chose Malaysia Airlines as it is a One World Alliance carrier with daylight flights out of and, especially, inbound into Australia. Convenience of schedule (so I could get some work done) was one of the main reasons to choose Malaysia Airlines. However, the service on the Sydney-KL leg was dreadful with no eye contact from cabin crew and snappy responses to passengers around me. The food on the KL-Bangkok shorter regional flights was much better than the food on the longer Sydney-Kuala Lumpur and return flights, but that's not saying much. Some of the worst airline wine I have ever had, if you could get it, and in fact was not offered at all on the lunch-time flight between KL and Sydney. The exceptions to this dismal performance was one excellent flight attendant on the KL-Sydney leg who did the best she could and, given that I'm a One World Emerald passenger (Qantas Platinum), I had access to the Malaysia Airlines First Class Lounge in KL which was superb. The lounge Malaysia Airlines utilises in Bangkok is awful.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-12-08;"Adelaide to London via Kuala Lumpur wit Malaysia Airlines. Booked this flight in March 2015 because it was the fastest journey time, only to find out a few weeks before travelling that the schedules had changed for the ADL-KUL leg and the flight no longer existed. Not only did we have to travel a day later, what had been a swift 2 hour stopover in KUL became 9 hours. Even worse, only my wife, who was under a different booking, was emailed about the change. My daughter and I received no notification and I had to phone them to ensure we all flew on the same terribly slow flights. That's it for me. I will never use this airline again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-12-07;"The Malaysia Airlines Business Class Lounge in Kuala Lumpur gave a fair warning that this was not a Business Class that could compete with many of its regional competitors, the lounge itself was full of trip hazards - little steps everywhere and slippery floors where there wasn't carpet which badly needed a cleaning. There were lots of staff in the lounge, but they were more intent on chatting to each other rather than on delivering customer service (except the very efficient crockery collector who whisked away everything the moment you put it on the table) but the crockery distributor wasn't equally efficient: at most of the self service distribution points, there were no glasses, plates or cutlery. This might have been a good thing as the food available looked tired and unapprtising, and below quality of the food available at the commercial outlets at the airport. The plane was clean and new, and the Business Class Seats spacious and still working. The cabin staff weren't particularly welcoming and failed to offer the assistance expected in Business Class. The food was of the same mediocre standard as in the lounge, and the food service delivery totally chaotic: my sister-in-law had to ask three times for a glass of water. I requested a glass of wine when my main course was delivered, and repeated the request a further two times, to have the wine delivered after my meal left-overs were cleared away. My wife had the presence of mind to look at the meals being delivered and requested ""just the fruit salad"" that she saw was being delivered to passengers in the other aisle (that aisle was being looked after by the senior steward and a friendly, efficient flight attendant). Fruit Salad she was informed was not available until the serving of the second course, but eventually another attendant asked why she wasn't eating and my wife repeated her request and was quickly served a bowl of the fruit salad. When the second course was served, my wife was presented with another bowl of the coveted fruit salad, along with all the other accompaniments which comprised the second course (none of which she wanted to eat). As I sipped my glass of wine, I was offered a basket of bread rolls which had been offered to the passengers in the other aisle at the start of the meal: I declined but assume that they were the most appertising part of the meal as passengers in the other aisle appeared to eat them. Business Class on Malaysia Airlines is beneath the standard of Business Class on Singapore Airlines, Thai, JAL, Cathay Pacific or Qantas.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-12-05;"I'm very dissapointed Malaysia Airlines have the idea on still using the old Boeing 737-8 with no PTV on its 2h 30m flights from KUL to BKI return. Its unacceptable.

I may consider using Malindo Air which offers confirmed PTV, spacious legroom and an all new fleet.";NEGATIVE

The seats were comfortable and spacious (I'm 5'8""). The food is tasty and there was a wide selection of drinks. There is no personal TV screen for inflight entertainment, but we were given a portable entertainment system which was heavy, but you can attach it to the pocket of seat in front of you so no problem with that. The downside of the portable entertainment system is the selection of movies are very limited. FAs are very accommodating and helpful.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-11-25;A fabulous experience on the MAS A380. Flew them on the outbound evening flight from KUL to LHR. Service was immaculate and the cabin crew on the upper deck economy class were attentive but were motivated and friendly. The flight was only half full so passengers were offered seats on the lower deck if they required it. Food was alright although it has dropped over the past year. The highlight of my flight were cabin crew. I hope the A380 continue to operate this route into Terminal 4.;POSITIVE

I have lived in Malaysia for a number of years and flown back to the UK many times and pretty much always found them to be above average. My last flight was business to London on A380 and apart from the dreadful lounge experience in KLIA the flight was great. Sometimes their ground staff at KLIA can be a bit underwhelming and not always know procedures. Even when I use them in economy, again can't complain too much, staff friendly and helpful. Entertainment system is adequate but not ground breaking or class leading.";POSITIVE

Flight out of KUL was about 70% full and the return leg only about 40% and a number of us had a row of seats to ourselves. The cabin crew are the real bonus for the airline. They were attentive, and generally genuine with the service. On the LHR-KUL sector, I was very suprised by all the 3 crew that served the cabin addressed me by name, and remembered my name throughout the flight (perhaps due to the light load). I noted there had been some slight improvements to the food compared to my trip in September. However, cleanliness of the aircraft needs to be relooked into. The tray spotted coffee stains. The cover of the overhead cabins were layered with dust on both flights.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-11-12;"Our second trip from Melbourne to London via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysia Airlines. First trip was good so we used them again and the same result. Excellent service from attentive cabin crew on each flight. I have vegetarian meal and my wife has gluten intolerant meals which are excellent for airline standards. Staff always recognise our special meal order. Boeing 777 is comfortable in outside row of 2 seats. We always opt for the upstairs economy seats in the A380 for a small fee, so we can get an outside pair down the back. Not too bad for space but bottom gets a bit sore on the long haul flight to London. We will continue to use Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE

Malaysia Airlines provide a large and comfy check in counter for Business class, and the staff are so helpful, they help us with overweight baggage condition. Onboard they served us with welcoming drink, then provide a warm towel. For only 1 hour flight they served us with authentic Malaysian cuisine and some vegetarian sandwich for my wife. Maybe Malaysian Airlines can improve their inflight entertainment (kind of movies) but excellent overall. Another lovely flight with Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-11-10;"We travel annually from Australia to London via Kuala Lumpur, and have always flown Malaysia Airlines. Onboard the service seems better and so does the food. The cabin staff are ever present and attentive. Our disappointment with Malaysia Airlines is that they have made detrimental changes to their rewards program, which they slipped through largely unannounced. It would have been a better decision to have been upfront and forthcoming about these changes - in the long term it may have bought them loyalty. A further disappointment is they have dropped many routes, including Brisbane which meant we had to travel to Sydney. This added around five hours to the journey. They have great and supportive cabin crew.";POSITIVE

I ended up buying another ticket based on this information, only to find out later that it wasn't my responsibility. Malaysia Airlines refused to reimburse me the money, and when I requested on occasions that my complaint be reviewed by a manager, they ignored my emails. There were quite a few other problems I had with them - including no vegetarian meal served on the flight despite having notified them of this requirement when I bought the ticket, misinformation and outright lies told to me by staff, complete confusion in some instances, and a refusal to reply to any correspondence. The customer service is ridiculously bad and I have no idea how they stay in business.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-11-05;"This was my first flight with Malaysia Airlines in years and I have to say that I was not disappointed at all. Sure the inflight entertainment could be better and the seats too, but the staff did their job and the flight was hassle free. The airline is struggling after two previous accidents and the impact these incidents have had on passenger numbers clearly showed on this flight. The plane was virtually empty so I was able to lie down in the middle 4-seat section. I hope the airline recovers and that passengers start flying with Malaysia Airlines again as they still remain a good quality airline.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-11-04;I wanted to fly Malaysia Airlines on the 26OCT from Dubai to Kuching. Flight was cancelled. Check in people only showed up 1 hour before. No information! Finally booked us in a hotel and told us with no other choice you are booked one day later. This is budget airline style! When they do not have enough passenger they move you on the next flight. For EU departure they have to pay 600 Euro beside the hotel. But Africa and others there is no consumer law practised. Therefore they take advantage and handle you like cargo.;NEGATIVE

I used the lounge in the satellite area which is ok but looks a bit run down now. Boarding through H8 so a train ride about 5min from the lounge. A smooth flight, breakfast tasted good. Drink runs made by a very chatty and nice crew. Malaysia Airlines offer a real business class on its smaller aircraft with 2-2 seat. Remote stand in HGK so a 10 min bus ride but once in the terminal immigration quick and bags waiting. Malaysia Airlines they still offer a decent product and I would use again.";POSITIVE

Found the seats to be comfy and suitable but as with any economy seat you soon have the need to move! Good screen size, IFE movie choice was limited and all movies edited with swearing removed. This despite warnings and film rating prior to the film. Good food, best in a long time on an airline. Drink service was frequent, never thirsty. Cabin crew friendly and treated us like individuals. My partner was sick in the last 2 hours of the flight, one crew member stepped in and was fantastic, he did all he could to make the situation bearable. Return was better, economy very empty, moved from upstairs to main cabin downstairs with 3 seats to each passenger! ";POSITIVE

Seats were comfortable but the screen for IFE was oddly positioned, being lower than it should be and hence requiring you to slouch in the seat to get the best angle. Food was excellent, with the signature Satay accompanied by prawn, scallop and crab salad and a fillet of beef tenderloin. Service was friendly and helpful.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-10-20;"Since I did not buy the ticket from MAS I could not do anything but check in online. So the options of MH upgrade etc were not available to me, despite the fact that I wanted to do them. Why would an airline prevent its passengers from doing so, is unusual. I travelled AKL-KUL-BOM-KUL-AKL and the seatbelt sign was kept on for 75% of the trip. After 30 minutes or so, passengers just get up and move around opening overhead lockers etc, the staff stopping them. Was switched off 4 times at my request during this trip. Just does not make sense, they are using this as a crowd control measure. Unfortunately, this prevents the passengers from walking around and preventing DVT.  AKL-KUL basically fine, food poor to average. Old plane (777-200) and not refurbished. Transit in KUL of 1 hour and efficient. KUL-BOM plane clean and newish. Some seats do not recline. Was given this seat without being told about this issue - despite paying extra to get exit row seats. Poor customer service in my opinion.  Importantly when queried about the seatbelt issue the staff doesn't want to listen. Other airlines traveling similar distances encourage you to get up and walk around and this was completely absent here.";NEGATIVE

All in all it was a good flight with no unexpected surprises. I would fly with them again, no problem.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-10-07;"I got the upgrade to Malaysia Airlines business class via the bid for upgrade program with a small amount of money. The check in was smooth but the staff looked arrogant and tired, the baggage allowance for only 2 pieces of luggage doesn't make sense for business class customer. The lounge is clean and tidy, staff with smile on the face, food options are limited when considering this is the home base hub for Malaysia Airlines lounge. The staff on board are experienced, no complains about them. The meal were served shortly after leaving KUL. Satay was the highlight of the flight, with exceptional main meal and desert. The seat is not fully flat, but was comfortable enough for 4 hours sleep throughout the 7 hours flight. The immigration clearance was smooth with the express pass that was given by MAS.";POSITIVE

A very bad experience indeed, with a very old (10-15 years?) dirty and noisy Boeing 777 instead of the A330  on which I booked, and which was withdrawn some 3-4 weeks before travelling. There were little inserts to make beds and the state of the seats was poor. The staff came to me to apologise for the state of the aircraft, but I will fly for a few hundred dollars more with Singapore Airlines. There was paper stuffed in the side of the washbasin in the plane as there was a big hole and staff informed me to please not remove it! Interior of plane looked very bad indeed. Airport lounge in Kuala Lumpur was a total disappointment, with food less than average and service non existent.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-09-30;"Amsterdam to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur, and overall Malaysia Airlines offers very good value in business class. As we were KLM passengers on this flight operated by Malaysia Airlines, we were able to use the KLM lounge at Amsterdam. It was pleasant with a wide selection of food and drink, but very crowded. We had a stopover in Kuala Lumpur, and the airport check-in for our second leg was very smooth (as KLM passengers we couldn't check in for the MH flight online). The Malaysia Airlines lounge at Kuala Lumpur was fine, but the food selection was distributed all over the lounge so it was hard to know what was being offered. On both flights the business class seat did not recline flat, and on the Boeing 777 the inflight entertainment system was quite clunky. Kuala Lumpur really shines in its inflight service and the delicious food it offers. In both Kuala Lumpur and Melbourne our luggage appeared in good time. We were happy with our choice of airline.";POSITIVE

Another steward was chatting with a passenger at 2F the whole trip, and there were less than 18 passengers total. My check-in luggage with 'Priority tag' came out last! How many chances do Malaysia Airlines need to compete with other low budget airlines?";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-09-29;"I gave Malaysia Airlines the benefit of the doubt in choosing to fly them from Melbourne to London via Kuala Lumpur. Whilst they were not the cheapest option for this particular trip, I hoped the service I received would reaffirm my decision in booking with them. Timeliness doesn't seem to be a big issue. The crew in Melbourne weren't even at the aircraft by the time the flight was supposed to be boarding and the situation at KUL doesn't help with security being at the gate of the flight. The aircraft were perhaps the biggest let down with both the A330 and A380 interiors being dirty, damaged and looking in worse shape than they should be for their age. Seat cushions appeared to be coming off, there were broken lights at the exits, the pillow I was provided with was stained and PTV screens were dirty and had to be wiped down before they could be used. The food provided was some of the most disappointing I have been provided from an airline. ";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-09-28;"I flew Kota Kinabalu to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur. This was my first experience of business class, and the angled lie-flat seats are not worthy of the distain I've seen heaped upon Malaysia Airlines. I found them comfortable enough and well worth the money, even on a relatively short overnight flight. The main meal was good and the second was more of a snack, but still ok. Although the range of recent releases on the IFE was limited, I found something to watch - and on both outward and return flights the flight attendants did not attempt to wrestle the earphones from me before I had finished watching, even though we were very close to landing. The service was fine: but what I really wanted to comment on was that when my first flight to KL was cancelled due to technical difficulties, the airline dealt with the flight reallocation very efficiently. International transfers were called to the counter very quickly and I was put on the next flight. I made the connecting flight - my luggage did not. However, the staff at Melbourne were extremely helpful. Within a few hours my suitcase was in Melbourne and the following day was delivered to my door - four hours drive from the city. Overall I think the airline deserves a better rap than it currently gets.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-09-27;"Sydney to Bangalore via Kuala Lumpur, and I fly this route consistently with Malaysia Airlines mainly due to the good timetable and great pricing. The stopover is only 90 minutes. The A330 from Sydney has the angled seats, but they supply a seat cover with padding which helps make it pretty nice, and a good duvet as well. Obviously angled is not the best but it is fine for me and I won't pay way more just because of this. Food is pretty strong - the satay is a hit, mains are good, dessert is limited but ice cream is always an extra. IFE is great, decent range and always has worked OK for me. I find service to be above average - they are usually friendly and efficient and can't remember a bad experience. My only complaint is the second meal on this 8 hour flight is just too small and always the same (pie and salad) - call me greedy but I want two proper meals in business class on an 8 hour flight. Unfortunately the short haul business class product (KUL-DEL) is below average - they use a Boeing 737 for all flights to India now and it is too small for this sector and time of day. The leather seats are battered an uncomfortable. Food is up to standard, but since all the flights back from India are red-eye's the upright seats are simply not up to par. They used to fly a Boeing 777 from BOM to KUL which had the proper seats and was always full, but they have dropped it back to a Boeing 737 for the overnight flight now - if there was an airline with a better product with a timetable that worked I would probably switch as a result. Overall I recommend Malaysia Airlines and especially at the price - they are reliable and consistent with their product and once you get used to KLIA it is a decent place to transit. Service and food has always been good - they are not top tier by Asian standards but have a perfectly good product for the price and it is nice to have that option.";POSITIVE

I was keen on seeing the new Malaysia Airlines and opted for MH with the MHUpgrade program and was happy to see my offer being accepted. But the new Malaysia Airlines was such a disappointment. They changed the equipment from Boeing 777 to Boeing 737 at the last minute. The aircraft was ancient, with business class seats which seemed straight out of the 90s so much for the new airline. Just one stewardess to cater to a full business class cabin, the menu choices and food presentation seemed like economy class in Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific. The quality of food was pathetic and I just ate the bread and left everything else. Of course the stewardess forgot to get my meal and drinks, and only remembered after I reminded her. The seats were so uncomfortable would rather have flown AirAsia and paid more for an exit row seat. If this is the new Malaysia Airlines then this is bang up job indeed. Never again will I subject myself to this torture.";NEGATIVE

I told myself give MH a chance to want to take their flight, although main aim is to cut costs at the expense of passenger comfort. I had a poor experience on a night flight from Paris to KUL, I asked for a packet of snack when I saw many on the pantry. The flight attendant disallowed me to take me to take one,  advising me they will go around to distribute. That snack came one and half hours later.

malaysia-airlines;2015-09-15;"We were supposed to fly Malaysia Airlines from Penang to Paris in an A380 until they decided to downgrade the plane last minute, and changed it to their ancient and dirty Boeing 777-200. Would like to change airlines at that time but it was too late and if we were to know they are using this aircraft we would not have chosen Malaysia Airlines. The Boeing 777 that we took for both flights were terribly old and seats were soiled and fatigued. The seat recline would require you to use some strength to push it down maybe due to the stiffness of the gears. Some of the seat fabrics were faded or torn. For sleeping, we were given an old pillow with an extremely thin  blanket that didn't help provide much comfort for the entire trip. IFE is a serious joke. It still use an ultra low resolution 7 inch LCD screen remnant of the 1990s that can barely display a good movie decently without straining your eyes. It's much better to watch with our iPad or phone as was really a horrible experience to watch with their IFE. The movies were not updated although it's stated in the September movie catalogue. It was still showing old movies from the previous month. Food in Malaysia Airlines used to be great compared to many other airlines. Now I would say it's a step below other lower rated airlines. Meal portions are smaller with lower value food servings. Choices for drinks, both alcohol and non alcoholic, were limited compared to years ago. In between snack for a long haul flight from KUL to CDG is a packet of peanuts and tasteless pizza sticks. We saw many passengers just left it there and opted for their own food instead. When it comes to the cabin staff, there is nothing much to really fancy upon, even though Malaysia Airlines has always promoted their excellent cabin crew service. The service is okay for an Asian airline but there is nothing worth commending. We weren't expecting first or business class service from them, but it seems that with a mediocre service, there was nothing much to shine for this airline. Malaysia Airlines has changed a lot in recent years and sadly it's not for the better. Poor management, inability to stay in the latest trends and lack of motivation from their staff has certainly taken its toll on this airline. Once a great and favourite airline of Asia has now totally lost its touch. Would not recommend it for long haul if it's their Boeing 777s.";NEGATIVE

I kept getting up because of the poor seat angle. IFE system is a relic from the '90s. Poor movie selection. Food wasn't great compared to what was served before. Clearly flying their ancient Boeing 777-200 is a downgrade (a rather severe one) from the A380 they had serving this route up to early Aug 2015. I've been a loyal customer to Malaysia Airlines for 2 years now, since I moved to Asia. They've been very patchy with service, baggage handling, unpleasant ground staff sometimes, some rather dated planes. But I stuck with them because of their A380 service to Paris. Now this is no more, I'm ditching Malaysia Airlines and moving to Thai Airways. They have proper flatbeds and a better IFE system. No reason to fly Malaysia Airlines any more.";NEGATIVE

I have a frequent flyer card (albeit a Blue card) and asked if I could sit in their lounge as I had 14 hours to wait for my flight.

I have never seen a worse business class or worse business seat in the last 10 years. Food is still served with plastic lid on top which is clearly not business class standard. Small TV in armrest and limited movie choice. Crew were nice, but we could feel that nobody believes in MAS anymore. The Malaysia Airlines Business lounge în Kuala Lumpur is another issue.";NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2015-09-05;"Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo return route with Malaysia Airlines, and it was a very good deal for money. The meals were brilliant, except one - they only had the fish left for lunch on my return flight, and I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, the satay, nasi lemak, and even the soba noodles were palatable, and on par with other airlines business class food. Cabin crew seemed very experienced, and were very pleasant. The ones on my return flight particularly were very attentive, with a good sense of humour. The only downside was the seat. I was lucky to have an empty seat next to me on both outbound and inbound flights, despite the former being full except for a couple seats. On both occasions I had booked a window seat, and since the A330 business class configuration was in a 2-2-2 layout, if the seat next to me were occupied, I would've needed to take a giant step over the person beside me to get to the aisle if he/she were sleeping. I found that a problem when flying the Kuala Lumpur to London route on Malaysia Airlines A380. However, unlike the A380, these seats are angle flat. The trade off for the flat most position was a steep incline. I found it terribly difficult and uncomfortable to sleep in this position as I kept sliding down the seat. However, on my return flight, I tried a different seat position which is way more comfortable for sleeping. the trick is to incline the backrest and footrest to the max and tilt the part where you sit on slightly back. It makes this sort of cradle, which allowed me to sleep really well for a third of the flight. It was a good experience flying with Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-09-03;"Malaysia Airlines frequent flyer member, but no extra service for Blue card members - not even early boarding available. Otherwise flights and service were good. Onboard service good and friendly, main meal excellent, limited wine and drinks, and no bar service on any flights, but this seems the way in economy cabins on most airlines these days. The 2nd meal snack service was poor, just a roll, filled with something soft. Also same product served on all four flights both domestic and international, they should look at catering menu for different service. Seat pitch good on international flight, movies mostly older classics but oaky, have inseat USB in economy which is great. Overall value for money, and staff try hard to make your trip a good one. Checkin at KL, all flights check in at any MAS desk, so most times a long queue, but it moves quickly. Good trip.";POSITIVE

There was an hour transfer in Kuala Lumpur and was worried that baggage wouldn't make it to Delhi, but everything was fine. Flight was enjoyable, friendly and attentive crew. It was a full flight on both sectors and crew managed passengers well. Drink runs were done frequently. Food was generous and enjoyable. Inflight entertainment, although limited but was sufficient. Both sectors used the Boeing 737-800 with sky interior - a nice aircraft. Leather seats were a little cramped but comfortable enough during the flight to Delhi. All in all, had a pleasant flight with Malaysia Airlines. ";POSITIVE

Check-in at both BOM and SEL was a breeze (BOM-KUL was about 30% load, hardly any line) and baggage arrived in good time on the belt at both ends. Cabin service was excellent, the crew were on their feet, quickly responding to requests and usually quite friendly. All special meals arrived as requested on all legs. On the flip side, the catering from KUL was wanting (foreign particle in the salad, bread half crusty, half soggy) and some of the aircraft had seen better days. A toilet door would not shut easily and amenities were sparse. I am told the 777-200 will cease flying to BOM shortly. Somewhat annoying was their practice of leaving the ""fasten seat belt"" sign on for hours at a stretch even when the flight seemed quite smooth - inexplicably they did not disallow passenger movement in the cabin and use of toilets even with the sign on, but refused to serve hot beverages for the entire duration.";POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2015-08-31;"Worst seat I have had in business class over last 30 years of regular travel. The cushion was so thin and worn, you could feel the metal of the frame digging into you. There is a large wedge cushion that is to be used when you lower the seat into an angled bed, so I sat on this cushion when not lying down. But then when lying down the metal frame was very noticeable again when using the cushion at your feet. For the price it was a disgrace in term of comfort. They say the worst business class is better than any economy, but I have to say this came close, I'm sure some good airlines economy would have been as comfortable. I know Malaysia Airlines are looking to change, but they need to, I felt robbed in terms of value for money.";NEGATIVE

I didn't have anything for a couple of days, but worse was no one from the airline contacted me to offer any assistance. I did have a phone number for their baggage department, but like every other airline that loses a bag, none of their team answered the phone. They do send you SMS messages, but they provide very little information that you can verify with anyone. The plane was tired, with two toilets in need of repair. On the way back to Sydney, I was staggered by the time taken to check in. Their systems for check in are very, very slow. The plane was a tired one, not clean, and one toilet wasn't flushing. Crew was ok, but they wake you to serve breakfast, which is a bread roll with cheese in it! Hardly worth waking for. I understand why they are in administration.";NEGATIVE

One of them was so impatient when passengers asked for a cup of water. Besides, my luggage was delayed for a day. And on 28 August I came back from Amsterdam to Taipei. Due to technical problems, the flight was delayed at Schipol Airport for three hours. So when we arrived at Kuala Lumpur Airport, many passengers missed their original flights. We waited for another three more hours for lining up to get new boarding pass. The ground staff arranged me to China Airlines since there was no flight to Taipei by Malaysia Airlines on that day. When I got to the gate of China Airlines, I was not allowed to board. They told me they didn't get any information from Malaysia Airlines and I was not on the list. Then I went to ask the ground staff of Malaysia Airlines. She called China Airlines to confirm the situation. After the call, she told me I should be ok to board - she didn't know the reason why China Airlines couldn't let me get in.  Then she arranged the flight for me next day and hotel in the airport for a night. She didn't try to communicate with the staff of China Airlines. Malaysia Airlines attitude is awful. ";NEGATIVE

However on entering the aircraft was disappointed to see a shabby and worn interior. The service was mechanical and the food was uninspiring. If you are flying this airline, do not expect any of the extra trimmings such as toys for the kids or amenity kits as it has all become very basic in view of their financial troubles. The IFE was acceptable, the state of the toilets were not. The flight was a couple of hours late taking off and we missed our connection to Kuantan.

I was among the unlucky, and I counted at least 3 couples in my seating area that had been seperated from their companions. However stewardesses were very helpful and did all they could to sort this out. After take off, drinks and peanuts were served, followed by a nice hot meal. Drinks were regularly served throughout the flight. Entertainment was good with new films and many good classics. We landed a little under an hour late and disembarkation was swift. Overall it was alright and I would recommend Malaysia Airlines.";POSITIVE

However, when we got through security it was on the board as being delayed 2 hours. Then it was changed to a 18.30 take off instead of midday. No one made an announcement to say or any reason given as to why. Passengers were passed from one counter to another to try and find what was happening and what would happen about connection flights. Sadly none of this was addressed at LHR. Finally the flight took off at 18.50, 6 hours 50 mins later than scheduled. The plane was dirty, food left on seats, trays not wiped down, traces of drinks and food on them. No hot towels were given during the duration of the flight (13 hrs), or travels bags provided. Food was also very limited, we were given one hot meals during the first 2 hrs of the flight, then nothing else until 2hrs before landing. Drinks were brought round twice, with meals, but no one informed you that you could go to the galley and get drinks or snacks during the flight.

I do not intend to put all other staff off, when the terrible ones were only a few out of tens of thousands. But I was refused a check in service prior 50 minutes before departure with no check in baggage. What's more agonising is that the person before me was checking in to the same flight. The ground staff was in yellow suit sort of uniform believed to be an officer, an officer who is supposedly a role model to all told me in Bahasa Melayu that they would not check me in unless it's 40 minutes before the flight, I pointed at the clock and replied it is now more 50 minutes before the flight, he raised his voice and said  ""who do you think you are that we should check you in?""

malaysia-airlines;2015-08-14;"I flew business class Dublin to KL via London Heathrow. This review is for the London to KL on the A380. I was very happy with the outbound flight as the service was impeccable and I had the bonus of an aisle seat in the middle with no one beside me. The return journey was a different story. The cabin crew and food were remarkable and was up to the usual high standards. However the seating arrangement was far from ideal for the single traveller. I requested one of the middle aisle seats so that I won't have to climb over anyone and no one will be climbing over me to get out. None available and I got an aisle seat next to a window seat. The person sitting next to me certainly spoiled the trip. Twice when getting out of his seat and getting back in he hit my shin with his heel, ok it may be an accident but common courtesy would suggest saying sorry but not a word from this individual. Granted Malaysia Airlines is not responsible for this but their seating configuration does not consider single travellers who may want some privacy after forking out to fly business class. For this reason alone I will not choose Malaysia Airlines for my future travel if I am paying extra to fly business class. Such a pity as they have some of the best food and cabin crew in the airline industry.";POSITIVE

I had not noticed at booking to change the meals to vegetarian. However the staff on board had vegetarian food available and ground staff organised it for return flight. Plenty of films. Water and fruit juice was regularly brought round, so we were not dehydrated. I wondered why the window screens were kept down and lights dimmed for majority of the journey?

The entertainment system works fine but on the return flight the IFE failed abruptly after both engines started.

No real complaints just up the cabin crew inflight service and get new planes. Awful time to leave at 12.05 midnight.

I have flown economy on it and while it did the trick I was helped then by the fact that the plane was about 60% full so had two seats to myself. In business I was hoping for a much better experience. I'm a broad fella (and carry a few pounds) and found the seats a bit narrow. They reclined fairly well but the sleeping position was on an angle. Even with the foot stop folded out at the bottom I found myself waking up after having slid down the chair a bit and had to readjust. Satay at the start are nice the meals were a little ordinary. Cabin were friendly and attentive. Entertainment / movies were perfectly fine though there are better ones about with different airlines. The fold out TV and awkwardly positioned tray table head phone jack and power outlet are a sign of the old business class seat design more than anything else. In the end it is ""ok"" and I suspect that business on the A380 would be much better due to newer seats. I am convinced that the catering companies in KL (departure point) are not too flash as the standard of food on all my inbound flights in the past (including this occasion) has been better than my outbound flight. While I could happily fly it again I wouldn't want to save up and fly the 777-200 in business all the way to Europe and back. Melb to KL would be fine though.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-05-05;Brisbane - Kuala Lumpur flight MH134 May 1st. Seven hours night flight in a very uncomfortable seat that does not lie flat and let you slide down. Very uncomfortable. Shall avoid any night flight on this airline if possible.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-05-02;"MH19 AMS-KUL 27/03. MH141 KUL-SYD 28/03. MH122 SYD-KUL 10/04. MH16 KUL-AMS 10/04. AMS-KUL-SYD-KUL-AMS in Y. One word: dreadful. Persistent delays on 3/4 sectors. Service onboard is below standard. Toilet supplies are never replenished on any sector. Complaints get a standard ""don't care"" response. Poor communication from baggage handling staff. Delayed luggage process is an utter shambles. In-flight entertainment has limited options. On the first leg the attendant left hot chilli pretzels for my two young children giggled and walked off. I went to change the packs for a different flavour and was rudely told that it's only one per passenger. On the second leg to SYD the attendant brought my children's food out. The attendant confirmed that these were child meals - when I opened it I found it was a spicy dish. I brought this to the attendants attention and asked if they could fetch the child meal that we requested. He stormed over to the people behind us snatched the food from in front of the children and dumped the food in front of my kids telling the people behind me in a very loud voice that I changed my mind. The return service was very similar. Departure out of KL was delayed an hour. If you need the toilet best to go in the early part of the flight as the toilet supplies are never replenished on all four sectors. Arrived in Sydney and with the delay in AMS meant my luggage was left in KUL. My luggage arrived the next evening. The air fares on MH are not the most competitive. If you can go with a competing airline for a similar price or slightly more go with that option rather than MH.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-27;I flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur then onto Melbourne I was a little disappointed with the flights the seat on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was the worst ever I ended up with a really sore back. There was not much of a selection for TV entertainment. The service was good and I enjoyed the satay the most. The cabins could do with a really good clean. I would not use them again unless I hear that the seats have improved.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-19;I did a return trip from Sydney to London via KL. The SYD-KL flight arrived half an hour early for some reason just making the stopover longer. The KL-London flight was an hour late. This meant I missed my connection and had to sit in Heathrow for 7 MORE hours. The return London-KL was once again delayed meaning another stuffed up connecting flight. The customer service was appalling no member of staff on the planes ever smiled at me. All of the food was inedible (both in economy and business) except the satay. The only decent thing about this experience was the comfort of the A380 seating although the Qantas one I have flown was superior in more ways than one. Last time I'm flying Malaysian considering how much extra it cost me in rebooked flights and how poor the overall experience was.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-19;Just back from a trip from Sydney to Vietnam via K.L. At 194 cms tall I always try for an exit or aisle seat. In Sydney outbound I was first in the Online check in 3 hours before take off only to be told that the plane was full and that I was stuck with the seat I had been allocated which turned out to be in the middle of a 4 seat section. It was an A300 plane and very uncomfortable. In K.L I approached the transfer desk and was assured that I now had an exit seat to Saigon. It turned out to be a very tight window seat nowhere near the exit. On coming back from Hanoi again first in line at check in I was again assured that I had exit seats on both planes to Sydney. Again the Hanoi flight turned out to be a tight window seat nowhere near the exit. Approached the transfer desk in K.L again to be told no exit or aisle seats available except the youngish lady next to this fellow interrupted to point out that there was an aisle seat available and then proceeded to give it to me. Why is it that this is a blatant load of lies? Prior to this I've flown with Malaysia a number of times and always had good service but this experience coupled with very poor seating on the A300 planes has now put me right off.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-16;DPS-KUL v. v. Flew on Christmas eve 2014. For first leg (DPS-KUL) there was no IFE in every seat. The plane was bit old but the cabin crews provided nice service. I got late dinner and for me the taste was good. Second leg (KUL-DPS) the plane was newer and they provided better IFE. still got nice service from the cabin crew but the meals that they served was so so. But overall this airline is nice and I would not mind flying with MAS again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-16;Only positive things I can say is the seat on the Airbus 380 was one of the most comfortable I have used and the satay was lovely. From Heathrow seat very comfy and the satay was very nice but make sure you have 2 or 3 serves as the rest of the food was inedible certainly not up to the standard of other (cheaper) business class meals I have eaten. Chef on call as advertised by them was not available and to order the meals you had to call would have been ok but I had 2 numbers and each number was a message that told me to call the other number. IFE and service moderate have had much better. Late into KL so was herded straight onto next flight to Sydney (Airbus 330-300) seats were very uncomfortable so slanted I kept falling down them no way to get comfortable at all I had an angled seat on a much cheaper airline and it was much more comfortable that this one it was just slanted so legs ached no matter what position it was put in. Again meal inedible and sandwiches (breakfast) given post landing were minuscule and service was less than adequate.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-16;HKG-KUL-JHB in 777-200ER and old 737-800. Very comfort seat with large seat width and legroom for 772 but the seat width for old 738 quite disappointed. Small and old PTV in 772 but the amount of selection of programmes are the same as other medium-haul flights in modern aircraft's. Food served was delicious but the side dishes and beverages was just moderate. Excellent staff service in both flights. I would recommend 772 but not recommend old 738 on medium-haul flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-16;SYD-KUL B777. Malaysia Airlines is great in the air but crook on the ground. Staff at MH offices in SYD and DEL seem to treat pax as a burden. Queuing times at SYD were long. Inflight service is fantastic. Fares have gone up and TG and SQ are cheaper. MH is great airline with inconsistent service on the ground. I will definitely fly MH and ask friends and family to fly MH in preference to others. But the airline needs to shape up ground services. Also the economy seats on the 777 are narrow compared to those on Emirates 777s. Their planes crew service KLIA is superb. Just fix those loose ends.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-12;Flew KUL-KIX (26/3) KIX-KUL (2/4). Successfully upgraded to business via plusgrade. All in all very pleasant experience considering the very small amount I paid for the business seats. Staff were very courteous and polite always addressing me by name and attended to my needs very quickly. Flight supervisor of the KUL-KIX was a very senior male steward. Very professional and casual at the same time. He would engage in informal conversations from time to time - nice personal touch. Food was standard business class meals. Satay as always was tiptop. The only down side I felt was the fact that there was no amenities kit provided for a medium-haul flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-12;Flew Sydney to KL on 19th March in business class and it was very average. The food was a big disappointment with only about 10 of us in the cabin and one of the 3 choices had gone before they were half way through the service. The cabin was grubby and when we lifted the tray table for dinner there were hairs and old food in the cavity where the tray was stored. The crew were pleasant enough but no one stood out for service with a smile! We try and fly Air New Zealand when possible as they are slick and definitely worth the price. Come on Malaysian clean up your act!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-08;PER-KUL-NRT on A333. Service good flights on time food OK. IFE had a good selection though it did need a reboot on the first flight. Aircraft new and very clean seat not so comfortable though noticed this especially on the 2nd red-eye flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-06;"Flew from Manila to Paris via Kuala Lumpur round trip. Flights were generally on time and slight delays were due to airport issues and not the aircraft itself. Sat in the front part of business class on the A380 (row 7&8) and seats were quite comfortable. The controls worked well and only comment I have is on flat mode it might not fit someone in excess of 6 feel tall (I'm 5""11). The bathrooms at the front of the 380 were the biggest I've seen on an airplane and was generally clean the whole trip. There were some cracks (covered by tape) and spills (cleaned up by not so nice looking rags) at the galley which I think MAS needs to repair. Food was good. Satay was great (even had a second serving) but the rest was standard business class food. They ran out of some spirits because they only used baby bottles instead of a proper large bottle. Staff were courteous as they always called you by your name and acted fairly quick to requests. They were quite engaging during lean periods of work which was actually nice. Just a minor comment. Overall MAS was a very pleasant experience for me and wouldn't mind riding on it again and recommending it to friends colleagues and family.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-06;JHB-KUL-CAN in new 737-800 and A330-300. Good legroom seats and offer high quality and sensitive touch screen PTV in every seats. The food served was excellence but the juices and coffee were just moderate. Various selection in IFE system except some categories. Staff service is better in domestic flight. Definitely Malaysia Airlines will be my first choice for flying.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-06;SYD-KUL return Airbus A330-300. Both flights were on time. Planes were clean seats comfortable excellent IFE. The service was wonderful especially from SYD to KUL. Food was good alcoholic drinks were available. Fantastic value for money. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-04;Flew from Brisbane to KL then Bangkok 3rd March Red Eye. First flight was great plane was clean and food was great. TV staff were so polite I was having a few vodkas and the staff actually came to see if I was ready for another drink they couldn't do enough. 2nd flight - plane a lot older staff not as polite but good flight. Returned 18th and 19th March - Staff were great on both flights food was great had no problems at all.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-04-04;Flew economy class from LHR-KUL return. Flying on the 18th March and inbound 26th on A380. No foot rests no hot towels and only two meals offered on such long flights. Packet snacks were available from the galley however. Drink runs were made and IFE was good but navigation could have been better. Noticed on the flight map that we avoided all of Ukraine taking a slightly longer route hence a little late into KUL.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-30;KUL-PEN Economy class on Boeing 737-800 Boeing Sky Interior. Smooth boarding attentive cabin crew AVOD in every seat. Peanuts and beverages provided on this short 40 mins flight. Comfort seat and legroom was fine for a short flight. Price was a bit higher than normal due to Chinese New Year Eve as most Chinese were going back home to celebrate.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-30;Flew MH16 KUL-AMS on March 21 Seat 03J and subsequently MH19 on March 28 Seat 02C. Good experience with the inflight supervisors and the selection of food and presentation. Attentive and always with a smile. The amenities kit were good but the sock not usable beyond 1-flight. The IFE was ok with not many choices of latest movies. Headset provided were faulty but exchanged upon request (MH19).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-30;Flew one leg Business class KL - Melbourne. Early Jan 2015. Had 5 hours to wander in the airport and went between both Business lounges and the shops. I think the airport is the best in the world for passengers. I agree the lounges are crowded but so are all lounges these days. I loved the lounges! Food was fantastic in them but more so onboard and always was in Economy as well. Service was one of the best and although bed could of been more comfortable it was a great flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-28;BNE-KUL-BNE Feb 2015 - Business via MH upgrade bid. I fly a lot this is my first time flying long-haul Business. The Qantas Lounge (shared by MH) in BNE is excellent. The MH Golden Lounge at KLIA albeit spacious is overcrowded the service is mediocre largely due to unstable Wi-Fi connection and chaotic service at the barista station. The in-flight experience both ways is the best I have had. The cabin crew were very attentive and friendly they addressed me by my name. The signature satay's reputation is well-earned and the three-course meals I had on both flights were well-refined. Hot towels offered multiple times throughout the flight is a nice touch. Great IFE selection and the reclinable seat was very comfortable I slept very well.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-28;MH 019 AMS to KUL 5 March 2015 Business class. The airplane was spotless and the crew welcoming and kind. The service was excellent and the food very tasty. The seat was comfortable enough for me to get 9 hours sleep on a 12+ hour flight. It was most enjoyable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-23;The airline is a mix of good poor and very bad. The first problem was booking vegetarian meals it can be missed if booking online and no way of changing online once booked. Had to phone twice to get it sorted the website quotes a number in Malaysia to phone found a UK number that redirects and considering I was on hold for 30 minutes thank goodness I did! The first flight (LHR-KUL) was excellent got seats in upper deck and was less half full ample drink runs and very friendly crew IFE was excellent. KUL-MEL BNE-KUL what difference snarly crew things were thrown at people and I saw a couple of people even being shouted at. For BNE-KUL leg the seat belt sign was left on for 5 hours even though no turbulence and crew refused any hot drinks. I looked forward to KUL- LHR but was in bottom deck of full flight and seats are very uncomfortable there and only 2 drink runs were done for 14 hour flight people were all pressing call button. Reason I chose Malaysia is so we could get BA miles but when returned discovered no miles awarded as was 'deeply discounted fare' even though was not cheapest and only £10 cheaper than CX who would have given miles. Not worthy of oneworld membership based on economy product.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;Flew Bali to Bangkok via KL on the 16 February. Took part in the business upgrade promotion and was successful. This really was a tale of two flights. The first leg to KL was just ok the food was terrible though and the flight attendants disinterested. After a few refreshing hours in the lounge at KL it was time for the flight to Bangkok again business class. Same aircraft 777-800 and what a difference with an energetic and professional crew. In all honesty would have been disappointed if I had paid a full business class fare.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;Travelled on MH176 from MLE-KUL. Was a redeye flight and was glad to catch some sleep. Meal was served and to my surprise it was a full meal! (Bun with butter salad main dessert) I was expecting the Mealbox that only consisted the hot meal and a cookie. Kudos to MH for that. Cutlery still isn't metal but same time isn't the crappy plastic ones. It's the more solid type of plastic! Kudos to them again. Enjoyed the Boeing Sky Interior on the B737-800 9M-MXH. Plane was very clean but MAS has to reconsider changing their pillows as they are so bad. That's the only downside other than the 20 minute delay which was due to the late arrival of the aircraft and runway congestion (both SQ and EK had to depart at the same time). Definitely recommend it as the price I paid is 3-4 times cheaper than SQ.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;I am a frequent customer of MAS. I have noticed that there are some improvements and also down falls. Their improvement is that they changed all their aircraft to new ones. The down falls are that the new seats are really tight (especially on the 737) Food portion decreased tremendously (even on the A380 routes) in-flight entertainment was fine but compared with other airlines its considered less and their hard products aren't really much to be impressed about. Their cabin crew are friendly but they can definitely do better. But the price is really good so i have no complaints about that. I really hope MAS would step up their game if they want to compete with other airlines. But all in all it is a good airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;Just returned from holiday to Thailand flying out from London to KL and on to Krabi. First time with MA. Both flights were late but that was the least of the problems! We arrived in Krabi on Saturday 28th Feb - our luggage arrived late on Sunday 1st Mar. Several other passengers on the flight and the following flight that afternoon suffered the same problem. Coming home we flew from Koh Samui to KL and then on to London - again both flights were delayed. This time however there was a 50% improvement they managed to deliver us and 1 of our 2 cases at the same time and in the same place - well done MA! Again there were around 20 other passengers who had delayed baggage. Seriously what kind of an outfit manages to mislay a passenger's cases twice on the same trip? Absolute shower. I shall never fly with this airline again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;MH408 on 20th Feb 2015. Kuala Lumpur to Taipei. Excellent customer service. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. The food was delicious. The IFE was good in choice and excellent. Overall excellent flight service and comfortable seat. I will keep flying with MAS.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;"Business class MNL-KUL/KUL-CDG and CDG-KUL/KUL-MNL. The crew on all our flights were very friendly and efficient (especially on MH21 on 7 March 2015). The seats were comfortable on the A380 and the food was good as we used the ""chef on call"" option. Not that big an issue but my only negative point in an otherwise very pleasant experience is that our luggage did not arrive with us in Manila and we had to wait for over two hours for our checked baggage to arrive on a subsequent flight.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-20;Was traveling to KUL-LGK-KUL with MH1430 and MH1447 in economy class. Everything was going smoothly. Refreshments were served since it's just an hour flight. On the returning flight unfortunately the B737-800 was old aircraft so there was no in-flight entertainment. The cabin crews were friendly. They welcomed and thanked every people with their smiles. Definitely will be flying with them next time.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;KUL-LHR MH04 Economy 13th Feb 2015. The flight is slightly delayed for about 30 mins waiting for air traffic controller's authorisation for departure. Cabin is clean and seat is only as comfortable as any economy seat can be. Inflight meal: got a pleasant surprise of satay being served to all economy passengers. Although only a very small portion it is a remarkably nice effort. Both lunch and dinner are adequately proportion edible nice. Seated at 80G the flight attendant in charge of that aisle was excellent. She helped 2 elderly couples who initially were seated in the middle 80E F to empty seats in front for their convenience. Same upbeat moods were also seen in other staff casual chat with passengers including helping some of the passengers in taking pictures. Inflight entertainment is good. Wide selections with both new and old movies all functioning well. Flight overall was smooth. Landing is smooth as always. Arrival is about 30mins late and that is inclusive of 3 circles over London sky due to congestion in Heathrow. Luggage are out by the time I got through the immigration. No damage noted. All in all a very satisfactory journey and glad to see the cabin staff in an upbeat mood. With the price that I got (unbelievably low) it's really a winner.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;Johor Bahru-Kuala Lumpur in Boeing 737-800 and Kuala Lumpur-Guangzhou in Airbus A330-300. Both flights were on- time with fast boarding. The service from flight attendants was great even thought the meal service was delayed due to shortage of crew during my flight to Guangzhou. The refreshments served were just moderate but the meals served were excellent both Nasi Lemak and noodles served with chicken and black pepper sauce. Very comfort seat and various selection in its inflight entertainment system except for some categories. Can get a 5-star service with less money spend would recommend.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;KUL-TPE (21 Feb MH408) and TPE-KUL (28 Feb MH367) with B738. Excellent service by very professional crew on both flights. Excellent food (especially the satay) and wine. Seats definitely comfortable for the 4 hour flight. The Purser on the TPE-KUL flight surprised me with a gift (being a One World Platinum). I look forward to flying MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;MEL-KUL-PNH/BKK-KUL-MEL. My trips were nothing to cheer about and as a strong supporter of MAH for a long time I considered myself as a low-maintenance passenger still I came out of flying with MH very disappointed. Crew members were so-so on their performance. Meal serving time looked like they do a sprint race rushing through to have the job done quickly so they'd time for themselves behind those blinds. There was only one time of drink offering between meal during 7h and 10mins. That soggy roll/sandwich served as breakfast was so pathetic and inedible. It's amazed me how once a five star carrier now becomes the ordinary one. MH please raise your game and don't take your passengers for granted.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;LHR-KUL-ADL and return. A380 very quiet and comfortable no problem sleeping meals fine especially the Satay. A330 on the second leg the seating not at the same standard but just about OK for the length of trip. The only problem we encountered was the return KUL-LHR leg delayed by over an hour with no sign of any apology FA were also very poor hardly a smile to be seen and quite abrupt which in my experience is most unusual for MH.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;Took MH760 from KUL-SGN on 19th February 2015. I was upgraded to Business Class through MH Upgrade option. Definitely worth the money. The Regional Golden Lounge was superb! The lunch served Chicken Biryani was delicious together with Cappuccino Cake as a dessert. Cabin crew was usual MH top notch friendly staff definitely recommend the MH Upgrade option to experience MH Business Class service. Will always choose MH as preferred airlines to fly with.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;Took SIN-KUL-PEN-KUL-SIN in February 2015 on Business Class. Each short leg I was served a hot tasty meal with linen napkins I was quite surprised. Very friendly professional staff. Clean cabins and warm Service. I was quite happy. There was no entertainment during the short flight.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;Flew Bali - KUL (777) and KUL - Krabi - KUL - Bali (737). The 777 cabin is old and dated but the sense of space is unbeatable. I would even prefer it over their 'newer' A330 longhaul business seat. On the three 737 sectors nice comfortable cradle seats with in seat AVOD IFE on two of the three 737 sectors. On the KUL - Bali flight without in seat TV we were given portable IFE players which was unexpected on such a short flight. Crew were excellent - considering that they all would have lost friends and colleagues this is a credit to them. Food was good a choice of three mains on each flight. Would definitely recommend.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-17;Reasonable Business Class Product but economy is not as god as other full service airlines. Flew BKK-KUL economy KUL-SYD Business and SYD-KUL-BKK economy. Business was due.to an MH Upgrade bid being accepted. I found the staff in business were friendly and proactive but in economy they can be surly and do not go out of their way at all to be of assistance. Golden Lounge in KUL was large but the food selection was limited despite Malaysia having some excellent dishes. On board the satay was excellent but my chef on call meal was accompanied by very hard vegetables. Dessert had no choice and was not exciting. Wine choice was excellent. The seat is better than economy but the angle made me feel like I always had to prop myself up so thank goodness for the footrest. Economy food was lacklustre and the wine is just palatable. Service not happy no menus and it took more than an hour for drinks to be served on a two hour flight. I did not see the staff come through with water or other drinks once. IFE is OK but it takes some time to get going and the collect the headphones a long time before landing and then show arrival videos. OK for a first time flyer but annoying for more frequent travellers. Overall it was safe online check in 48 hours before flight is good safety not an issue. MH just needs to elevate staff attitudes and encourage a bit more friendliness and the perception of their product will improve even if the hard product does not. Good prices make MH a decent choice but they are not as good as other one world carriers.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-09;I am on my 'mileage run' trips in March the first 2 legs was semi-long haul KUL-ICN Return in Business class with MAS MH66 and MH77 on 28 Feb (outbound) and 2-Mar (inbound). Since I only had about 16 hours in Incheon the cabin crew who served on the both flights are the same set of crew. Boarding/Depart/Arrival - Both were on time. Priority boarding for business class pax was observed. It was a full Business Class pax load all 36 seats were filled (MH 66) and 30 pax on MH 67. Generally smooth process. Seat/IFE/Amenities - I reckon the major downside of MAS is the hard product of its Business Class. The flight was on A330-300 aircraft (2-2-2) which was generally mediocre with angled lie flat bed. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but I found it to be comfortable and had a good sleep. I would really recommend that MAS upgrade the quality of its pillow blanket etc especially in terms of the fabric which looked 'very cheap' certainly not luxurious-looking compared to offerings from say Qatar. Having said that they did serve the intended purpose. IFE: Like always I enjoyed the IFE offerings. It may not have the most volume in terms of selection but every time I manage to find something interesting to watch. There was no amenity kit provided on this leg for flight time of 6 hours (another let down) but the amenities provided in its lavatories were adequate for red-eyed flight e.g. shaving kit toothbrushes and scented spray. I think the hard product really needs new/modern make-over even on A330 to remain competitive with other carriers and exudes more of that luxurious taste. Perhaps a Herringbone layout with all aisle access bigger/higher resolution screen with touchpad controller fully lie-flat bed and more luxurious comfort kit offerings? Food - Delicious as always. The Signature Dish - Satay needs no introduction. I ordered Chef-On-Call for both legs of which were delicious (MH66 - Fried Noodles with black paper chicken. MH 67 - Beef Tenderloin with Green Peppercorn). Besides the main Bus Class pax was also served light refreshment such as dessert fresh fruits and Hagen Dasz ice-cream. However due to turbulence on MH66 no hot beverages were served which was quite a let down. Cabin Crew - Genuine smiles I was addressed by name at all times. Crew efficiency was excellent on both flights no long waiting to be served with meals or other ad-hoc requests. What impressed me was the attention to detail that the crew did. Generally I was very satisfied with this trip from all aspects. The main improvement needed is on the hard product offerings even on A330 type of aircraft which are truly a let down given their excellent service of cabin crew/F&B.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-09;Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo 9 February. The best part of the flight was the excellent customer service. Very friendly and professional. The food was quite average. Chicken and vegetables for lunch and the snack towards the end of the flight was a soggy tuna roll. The IFE was quite limited as well. But again it was the excellent flight service that saved the trip for me.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-09;MEL-PNH-MEL. I've flown with MH 5 times in the last 15 months and noticed nothing improved in staff performance and catering Staff looked businesslike not much time to smile and abrupt. Food was so-so and I must admit that soggy roll/sandwich served as breakfast from KUL to MEl was so revolting. Only once or twice were drinks served between meals for the whole 7 hour flight. MH is now just a bit above budget carriers that means well below par for an airline that used to be 5 star. Still I'll continue to fly them because of their competitive price.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-09;AMS-KUL MH019. KUL-MNL MH806. MNL-KUL MH803. KUL-AMS MH016. The trip was all in all good but it seems that the seats in economy 777 are getting worse in comfort - very hard. They need to refurbish economy class. The crew were polite and very helpful.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-04;Travelled from DPS to BKK via KUL. Flew on 777 and 737. Good clean planes but what stood out was the service from the flight attendants. They were very friendly and the service was excellent. All in all it was a great experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-04;ADL-KUL-PNH and return. Outbound ADL-KUL the crew were very ordinary. Plane was only half full but flight attendants rushed through drinks and meal service to hide for the for the majority of the flight. Meals were virtually thrown at the passengers. KUL-PNH was better but crew did their job-no more. Legroom was extremely tight. Return sectors were better but standards no match for rival airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-04;Flew MEL-KUL return on MH146 and MH147 on A333. First time flown was not disappointed with anything major apart from the fact that the return flight was delayed for about an hour. The food was fine. The entertainment system was okay apart from the slightly slow speed but I kind of expected it. I liked how there was an online option for reading the inflight magazine which was very detailed. I wouldn't hesitate about booking with MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-03-04;My recent flight from KL to Bali and return was the worst I had taken with MAS. The crew service was so bad that I felt like I was a burden to airline. The food onboard consist of a bun and what l was told was chicken on a 3 hour flight and on the return flight a snack sized chicken with potatoes (at least it was a hot meal). What happened to the warm buns with butter served with a side salad and a dessert which MAS used to give even on a 2 hour flight? In addition technical glitches on the seat display screen showed that we were flying across Eastern Europe when we were flying across Indonesia. On the way back the distance from location was displayed at 1145 KM from destination for the entirety of the flight. The seat was constantly in a reclining position even after many attempts to straighten it (please look into fixing seat 16A flight no. MH 714 25th Feb 2015).;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-24;First time on MAS for a long time Jakarta to London via KL. First flight was bang on time newish looking aircraft with good seats decent IFE and nice food. The long haul flight to London was pretty good when we eventually boarded it as it was delayed 15 hours due to a technical fault. The ground staff were quick to organise hotels for everyone but were completely clueless when trying to rebook me and various other stranded business class passengers onto other carriers as an alternative - given that this was at MAS's base this stretched credulity. Once onboard the A380 to LHR the standard of the product remained as good as the first flight albeit with even more room and a decent proper flat bed seat (which was a lot comfier that its conventional appearance suggested). It's a shame that the management of the delay put a major downer on what otherwise was a good experience MAS could do with a few lucky breaks at the moment and it feels as if they shot themselves in the foot here.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-24;I flew back from holidays on Malaysia Airlines MH21 from CDG to KUL on Business in early January. Overall is fantastic and we had great food from Paris until KLIA. Seating on the Airbus A380 was great but my daughters seat was not working well and she did not enjoy her trip home. Services from the stewardesses and flight manager were fantastic as expected from Malaysia Airlines but some improvements are badly needed especially no toiletries bag provided anymore on Business Class.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-24;London-Kuala Lumpur. Check-in through business class check-in due to oneworld membership. Very fast check-in. Flight was on an airbus A380. Flight was delayed by 1 hour due to 'late arrival from Kuala Lumpur'. Boarding was fast and efficient. Extremely big plane and seats were very big compared to MAS and Qatar's A330 seats. Food was served twice with snacks in-between. The first meal 'lasagne' wasn't that nice. The second meal 'fried mee' was extremely delicious. Drink and snacks were served frequently. Crew members were extremely friendly. Entertainment was extremely good. Arrived kl 50 minutes late. Overall extremely good flight. Will fly again with MAS.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;Travelled recently to New Zealand with my wife to visit our son. The flights out and back were with Malaysia Airlines. The flights out from LHR to KL and from KL to Auckland were not exactly the best we have experienced. The service on board during both flights was average and did not reflect the friendliness with which Malaysia is renowned. The staff seemed intent on serving drinks and food as fast as they could and ignored reasonable requests for additional items such as water not only from us but other passengers as well. The food served up was pretty poor and certainly did not reflect the style or quality expected of Richard Corrigan the airlines named chef. To add insult to injury when we arrived in Auckland our luggage apparently was still in LHR we eventually received them 5 days later. Our return flights this time from Auckland to KL and KL to Amsterdam were no better and we rated the food on offer as being worse than the outbound flights. Indeed neither of us could eat anything on the KL to Amsterdam flight as it was almost inedible. The service was marginally better than the outgoing flights however still fell short of what we had expected. When we queried the delayed luggage at Auckland prior to the return flights we were simply passed off with various excuses. Indeed the contact numbers we were given somewhat reluctantly were useless as they only connected to ticket offices and the staff in these locations (presume LHR) were incapable of offering any help or alternative contact numbers as they tended to hang up on our calls.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;I'm a regular business class traveler. Traveled with MH from Hong Kong to Kuching on business class. Plane was a 737-800. Seat wise acceptable with 2x2 configuration. As I was travelling from Hong Kong I used the Cathay lounge instead. I used the golden lounge at Kota Kinabalu airport I was in BKI waiting for the next connecting flight the golden lounge was acceptable being a domestic golden lounge. No alcohol is offered with normal fare buffet like few curries some not very attractive sandwich etc. Business class was unfortunately unappealing among seated the FA did not come and greet me by my name. The seat was not cleaned throughout with few left over plastics scattered all over the place. Proper newspaper was not provided in the seat. Proper menu was not provided. FA came and ask to collect order without proper mentioning of what was available. Usually hot towel was provided not cold towel was provided instead. Pay attention to details was largely missing for eg packaged butter was used instead. FA was friendly but lack of their enthusiasm about their job. This is not a proper business class offering it is becoming more like premium economy class instead. Malaysia Airlines if you are reading this what is heck is going on with you?;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;"Feb 2015 flew business class PER-KUL MH126 A333 KUL-KBI MH2640 B737-800. KBI-PER MH0121 B737-800. I hadn't flown with Malaysian since around 2009 and over the years there has been a noticeable drop in service. I used to rate MAS right up there with Singapore and Cathay but that has changed. Those little toiletries bags are no longer issued in any shape or form and as another reviewer noted the magazines and literature is tattered and worn. Indeed as we descended into Perth the Stewardess scrambled around the seats collecting the menus for re-use. I am guessing they were for reuse because as I read mine on the flight I thought it looked a bit dog eared and worn. The cabin service on all flights had one modus operandi and that was that the cabin crew would get the food service done as soon as possible and then draw all galley curtains so they can doze or chat for the duration. Cabin attendance and presence on all sectors was woeful. I recalled my past flights with MAS had the cabin crew were almost graceful as they went about their business however now they seem to be in a rush and they really should be wearing joggers so they can run around the cabin. The service was simply awful. To highlight this point on the KUL-BKI sector I boarded the aircraft to find a rubbish bag sitting on my chair where the cabin had been cleaned by the ground crew but they had forgotten to take the rubbish bag. I handed it to the attendant and she simply smiled and said ""Thank you sir"" like it was a gift. When I sat in my chair it kept reclining backwards and would not remain upright so I called the same attendant and pointed out that the seat was broken. ""Yes Sir we know this because it is reported in our flight maintenance log"". So why would you put a passenger in a broken seat? More to the point there were spare seats available so I moved but the crew should have blocked that seat and redistributed pax automatically. On the A333 the business class seats are as you would expect but there are better on other airlines however the B737-800 business seats are the old style barber chairs and are simply wider and all manually activated. This decline in service and product has been obviously happening over a period of time and I feel MAS is on the decline. I won't be flying with them again if I can avoid it.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;HKG-KUL-BOM. B737 from Hong Kong and B777 to Mumbai. 737 seats are comfortable and sufficient for the sector. B777 seats are totally outdated and need to be replaced. Food drinks and crew were great on all flights. First class lounge in KL is quiet and well served by staff. Malaysian are making an effort to recover from the horrors of last year.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;SIN-KUL on MH608. Travelled Business Class SIN-KUL-AKL. Poor selection of food at Lounge on KLIA magazines etc in seat holder dirty and placed any old how. No menu - air crew just came around asking each person if they wanted the beef or chicken dish. Preordered meal had to be handed back as it was inedible. Staff lacked any sense of customer service. Cabin looking tired. Just received the Malaysian Airlines ENRICH membership card upon return home - it went straight into the bin as I will never be flying Malaysian again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;It is with a very heavy heart that after travelling with Malaysian Airlines for over 20 years on a twice a year basis and enjoying the wonderful cabin servicing they offer I have to write this report. On boarding from LHR in the upper deck I asked the hostess if she could put my bag in overhead locker as I had wrist splints on for Arthritis I was amazed that she pointed to my wife and demanded why she would not do it. At 5 ft my wife could not reach the locker so reluctantly she put the case up for me. Thus began a very miserable flight. Cabin crew did not serve hot drinks throughout the 12 hour flight only on demand then reluctantly. Food was OK but served with a miserable attitude by all the crew. This sort of attitude shown by the crew will not help an ailing airline. Come on Malaysian get your act together and serve those who are willing to keep loyal to you.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;MH 367 TPE-KUL on 4 Feb. Using the B738 with new Boeing interior. Flights on time. Food delicious and good enough portion. I was very enjoy the flight for over 4 hours flight. Good inflight entertainment and the cabin crew serve in professionally. Overall is excellent and I will support and fly with MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;I flew from Seoul (ICN) to Kuala Lumpur (KUL) on an A330. Flight was delayed 1 hour but it didn't matter so much since we arrived at gate 30-40 mins before boarding and everything just seemed normal to me. Seat was very comfortable and food was not too bad. The touch screen wasn't working very well but still there were some good movies to watch. Staff were very kind although some were wearing too much makeup. The toilet was very clean. I would definitely fly with MAS again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;KL - Auckland return flight in economy. I chose MAS because it was the only direct flight from Malaysia to Auckland and of course the cheap promotion fares. Checked in process was smooth and flight boarding on time. I couldn't believe when I stepped into the plane because it was a really old Boeing model and the floor looked dirty. Seats was just OK and I couldn't sleep for whole night. The inflight entertainment was OK but the screen was so small old and not clear. KL to Auckland - most of the staff were unfriendly. Maybe because of the midnight flight where they can't sleep hence in the bad mood? They seldom walked around with water. However Auckland - KL the staff were efficient and friendly. Plane looked better and not as old like the Boeing flight from KL to Auckland. Food and beverages were good.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-18;CGK-KUL-HKG on 5 February. The first leg was on a 737-800 new aircraft with quite decent IFE. Staff were fine with fair service. One thing to note is the cleanliness. The aircraft is brand new but it seems to be a lack of maintenance for the interior. 2nd leg flight was using the 777-200 MH72. It seemed aged but surprisingly the seat is more comfortable and legroom was spacious. Served lunch and offered drinks generously by the female FA. Unfortunately the other male flight attendant was not friendly at all.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-12;MH 624/804 Dec 20 2014. SIN-KUL-MNL and MNL-KUL-SIN. My only complaint is the very slow check-in service in NAIA Terminal 1 took us 1 hr in the line.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-12;Flew MH 131 KUL-AKL Business Class on Jan 31 on B 777-200. First time flying Business Class on MH. Appalled by overall experience. The only positive aspect of the experience was the seat which was reasonably comfortable (even if not 180 degree lie flat). Warning signs started a few days earlier when attempted to book a meal online through Chef-on-Call service. Unable to do so due to maintenance issues had to call MH Contact Centre. Golden Lounge at KLIA had adequate seating but poor selection of food staff did not greet you personally upon being seated in business class cabin as I had come to expect with many other airlines on Business Class magazines on pocket of front seat dishevelled and looked dirty no food menu - cabin staff came around asking if you would like the lamb or the fish (with no further description offered - this occurred for both meals served during the flight) the meat dish I had pre-ordered had to be returned as it was inedible. A cloth serviette was place on your tray and a clothe serviette containing cutlery was then given to you prior to being served your meal - ie there was no laying of the table for you. Staff seemed hurried and uncaring. Cabin looked tired with threadbare carpet. IFE substandard. MH Enrich Loyalty Card going in the bin - as I won't be flying MH again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-12;KUL-HKG-KUL on MH72 and MH73. Both legs flown by MH's 20 year workhorse 772s. Didn't think too much of the supposed loud engine noise seen in some of the comments here. Prefer these older 772 seats with MH rather than the new ones installed in their 388s and 738s as they have more legroom pitch and comfort. Plane interior (seat pockets galleys toilets etc.) were quite clean well maintained and in good working order. FAs were quite friendly and helpful on both legs. Drinks served every hour with meal and snacks served throughout the 3+ hour flight. Only slight comment would be about the IFEs on the 772s. Smaller and dated screen compared to the newer MH planes but functions just as well as the new systems.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-06;Flew Melbourne-Phuket (via Kuala Lumpur) return. Outbound on an A330. Entertainment was good. Cabin crew were abrupt. First meal was edible but the second was some sort of 'sausage roll' and it was revolting. They didn't offer too many drinks. On the KUL-HKT sector an old 737 was used. We were served the most disgusting soggy roll. At least on this sector the cabin crew were a little more friendly. On the return from HKT to KUL a newer 737 was used the food was quite nice and the cabin crew were friendly. The last flight from KUL to MEL was on an old 777-200. MH rather inconveniently uses a 2-5-2 layout on this plane. The plane was old with an ancient looking entertainment system. The food was okay on this flight and the cabin crew were better than on the flight over. Overall they need for do far better if they want to be an airline of choice in the future.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-02-06;PVG-KUAL-CDG on 22 Jan 2015 MH 389 Airbus A330-300 MH 20 Airbus 380. I took 2 flights both flights in economy. Staff in the air are efficient. The seats are just OK. The food was so-so I chose the steamed rice and fish but the fish was awful. Concerning the entertainment what is frustrating is the quality of sound which is very low added to the fact there is not a great choice of movies.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-30;Jan 21 MH 807. Jan 25 MH 804. Round-trip Business class MNL-KUL. Jan 21 and Jan 25. The service from the staff was excellent! The only downside is that the plane looked dirty but maybe it was just old. Other than that - quality service and good value for money. I highly recommended.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-30;Flew with Malaysian Airlines for the first time for my SGN-KUL trip and was disappointed. Knowing for its five star reputation I had high expectations on this flight. Instead they used an old aircraft with no entertainment. I thought okay if they didn't have IFE maybe magazines will do. But when I took it out the magazines were badly damaged that I don't even want to touch it. So there I was sleeping for the whole entire flight. Meal was pretty good but the flight attendants weren't as nice. They should really keep up with the other competition that are quickly improving.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-30;AMS-KUL-PER (Economy) 4 of us flew with Malaysia on a round trip from Amsterdam to Perth during January. The staff and comfort on the planes was excellent and with one exception the food was reasonable. The exception was the breakfast on the last leg. A dish of boiled rice with half a boiled egg embedded and what I took to be a savoury sauce on one side. Having stirred it all together I found that it was a very strong curry/pepper of which I was unable to partake as I am not fond of any curry/pepper meals. Curry for breakfast! Come on Malaysia - surely you can do better. However - the Administration Department of Malaysia Airways is awful. I emailed them 3 times with particular problems and did not even receive acknowledgements. We actually started our journey from Dublin but this was with Aer Lingus and I cannot fault them. However they were unable to issue our Malaysia Boarding Cards and told us this had to be done in Amsterdam. Luckily we hurried to the particular desk as we were fourth in the queue. There was a single lady at the desk and she was taking 15 minutes per client. It had something to do with re-routing late arrivals from the incoming plane onto other flights as they had missed their connections. So after an hour we managed to get our passes. But Amsterdam is a big airport and it takes ages to negotiate so we had to be quick in getting to the gate. The flights on the 777 and 330 were very comfortable though they were not the seats I had originally requested. As I said earlier I cannot fault the staff on board. They were very attentive and came round very regularly with drinks. On the last leg (KUL to AMS) the entertainment to two of our seats did not work well and I could only get music which was not a bother as I do not normally watch movies on a plane. However I did miss the flight progress maps. The staff did try to reset the system (twice) but without success. I have used MAH in the past but this experience has dimmed my enthusiasm for them and I may just decide to change operators for my next flight to Australia.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-30;Kuala Lumpur - Ho Chi Minh City return 16-18 Jan. We were a family of 6 adults and 2 kids. Flight was uneventful but I have nothing nice to say about the crew serving us. Outbound the steward sarcastically ticked off my 9 year old nephew for taking a few seconds of his time to decide which meal he wanted. No social etiquette at all. Outbound we were only served a sandwich which was awful. Inbound a stewardess gave my nephew a child's meal but not my 4 year old daughter. When I asked for another one for my daughter she said no I had only ordered one. I am Malaysian and have flown countless times with them but not anymore.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-26;SIN-KUL-HKG on MH602 and MH72 16 January 2015. Paid to upgrade to Business Class through their MHUpgrade programme as I've never flown Business before and the prices were irresistible. It was rather worth it. Their Golden Lounge in Changi Terminal 2 was small but cosy and had a decent selection of food (could be improved but maybe it's breakfast). The SIN-KUL leg was on an old (leased) 738 so there was no IFE and the Business Class seat was nothing remarkable. Service was good however and they provided some bread for breakfast (early morning flight in fact the earliest possible for SIN-KUL) compared to peanuts for economy class. Golden Lounge in KLIA was better: bigger wider selection of food many comfortable rest areas and comes with a view though it was also quite crowded. Due to short connecting time I did not spend much time in the lounge. KUL-HKG leg was on their 772 which is of some age but the Business class was still well-maintained. Caveat: this being my first time flying Business I have no basis for comparison with other airlines' products. Leg room was excellent seat comfort was good. While the seat is not lie-flat but inclined (angled-flat) I was still able to snooze well for a bit and it was still quite comfortable. Service was great: many flight attendants for Business Class and with low occupancy in Business each passenger received good attention and treatment. They addressed each of us by name and were forthcoming with serving food drinks and newspapers. Flight attendants were very friendly (chatty too) and helpful with my requests. Ordered food via Chef on Call and the steak I ordered was great. Unfortunately I was so full from the meal that I did not finish my dessert. My main quibble would be the IFE which is rather antiquated and has rather limited offerings compared to its newer planes and other airlines. Overall for short or medium- haul flights I'd definitely consider MH again especially given how competitive their pricing is nowadays.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-26;This airline offers a good route network and since it is part of One World I decided to try it out. I took 2 flights CGK to KUL and KUL LHR. Both flights in economy. The staff both on the ground and in the air are charming and efficient. The seats are just OK. The food good. The entertainment system (on the A380) was frustrating to use because the software is inferior to other airlines A380 entertainment systems. However quality of sound and pictures was fine. So far so good. My only issue and one which would make me only use Malaysian as a last resort is the cleanliness of the aircraft. The seats trays magazine pockets magazines windows were all grubby and could do with a good deep clean. The carpets on both flights looked tatty. There were cobwebs between the window panes. The worse thing was the toilets on the 380. I tried 4 of them and all filthy. I am sorry to say that this doesn't meet the standards of other One World carriers or Skytrax 5 star airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-26;HKG-KUL-SIN on MH73 and MH607 19 January 2015. Did not pay to upgrade to Business Class so I flew this return leg on Economy. Still quite worth it (the price was comparable to budget airlines) overall. Just one day before my flight they sent an SMS to tell me that my earlier flight MH449 (on a B738) got cancelled and put me on MH73 (on a B772) scheduled 40 minutes later. Apparently MH449 often gets cancelled probably due to low occupancy. The flight on MH73 was not full too which does indicate much spare capacity on this leg. The B772 I flew for HKG-KUL was of some age evident in the seat design and IFE. Leg room was supposed to be 34 inches (on newer planes it's 30-32 inches) though the difference didn't seem significant. That said I had quite enough space (for someone 1.76m tall) so maybe I'd feel the difference when flying long-haul. I appreciated the 2-5-2 seating arrangement as I like the window seat but hate clamouring over many people to go to the toilet. In any case because the flight was not full my neighbour went somewhere else to snooze. The IFE box under the window seat is rather annoying however. IFE was old (small blurry screen) and the selection was limited. The food served was quite decent especially main course and dessert. The salad was weird though an attempt at Asian-style coleslaw that failed miserably. Service would be my major quibble on top of IFE. Flight attendants did their job but they seemed less warm than compared to my experiences in Business Class on the onward journey to HKG. I found it weird that passengers had to help themselves to the drinks (attendant holds out the whole tray of drinks to you and you take whichever you fancy) instead of the attendant passing the drink to the passenger (which is the case on most flights I've flown). Attendants were occasionally unsmiling or fierce and sometimes their smile seems a bit forced. Thankfully my HKG-KUL leg landed on time because I had a very tight connection to KUL-SIN (thankfully baggage arrived on time too). For the short HKG-KUL leg only peanuts were served. It was a newer 738 so the seats looked fresh and the IFE quality was excellent (not that you use it much on such a short flight). Overall their Economy Class definitely pales in comparison to its full-service competitors but the prices are so competitive that lower expectations are deserved. I'd still consider flying MH in Economy next time especially if the price is right.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-23;MH001 15 Jan LHR-KUL in economy class upper deck seating check in at Heathrow was fast and efficient. On board crew were very pleasant offering plenty of water and juice runs the food was better than my previous flights last year. MH149 19 Jan KUL-MEL in business class on on old B777 even though this aircraft is old it was clean and in good condition. The crew were good but clearly have no knowledge of wines or how and when to serve them in business class you expect good service and knowledge of what they are providing (this was not 5 star service).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-23;My wife and I are Platinum One World frequent flyers. We flew from Sydney to KL on MH122 on the 20th of January in business class with our son in business class. The plane was one of the oldest I have ever flown on. The staff were not welcoming and proceeded to talk the entire flight loudly in the galley. The toilets were flooded and dirty yet no effort was made to clean them. The entire crew attitude was unhelpful and a poor reflection on Malaysians who are typically very warm and welcoming. This was the worst business class flight I have experienced.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-23;MNL-KUL-LHR Economy. Pretty slow and inefficient check-in in MNL with all the construction work in T1. Flight was 30 mins late in departing but they made up most of that on the journey. Excellent transit in KUL with transit security located at the gate which I always prefer. Cabin service on both flights was nothing special and the food was disappointing. Breakfast on the London flight was inedible after a 10 hours flying. Very small passenger numbers on the A380 gave most passengers a whole row to stretch out which was great on a 13hr+ flight. IFE was OK but not as good as the competition. I don't usually like 13hr flights but the space on Malaysian made it a great way to get to Europe and bang on time getting into LHR.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-23;I flew Malaysian Airlines for the first time in business class from London to Kuala Lumpur on Christmas Eve. The plane was an A380 and the seat was comfortable. The cabin crew in business were the most unfriendly team I have encountered in the sky. When asked why the standard pre-flight drink of bubbly was not available a cabin staff member said that this was due to customs regulations. Red wine with the main meal was served cold. While the facility to pre-order meals is a positive feature business class with this airline is poor value compared to that available from other carriers flying between Ireland/UK and South East Asia.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-23;My partner and I had mixed experiences flying from Frankfurt to Auckland and back in the last month. We chose Malaysia Airlines because of price short connection times and the extra baggage allowance. The flights to NZ were not bad: food was better than expected and service very pleasant too. We had a less than positive experience on our return flights. On the plus side when we noticed that the plane was half empty on the AKL-KL leg and we asked to move to seats with more leg room our request was granted. This made for a very comfortable and pleasant flight. However our second return flight was delayed in KL for some time so we were exhausted and severely sleep deprived by the time the flight finally got clearance to take off. The plane was very full and it was an older plane with rather an incredibly noisy engine and rather tired seats - not in the best condition. Both of our entertainment units were not working properly so we couldn't watch movies and the staff seemed too busy and stressed too help. The fish we were served was too spicy to eat (and we are used to eating fairly hot curries and Indian food) and later we were offered 'spicy prawns' for breakfast - no thanks! We would be very unlikely to fly with Malaysia Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-21;The ratings posted here are the ratings I've flown on more frequently on the B777-200 from Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur. The aircraft had a clean and tidy cabin and all seats have a different colour. Toilets were hygienic enough. The staff service is terrible because they don't respond at all! The seats were comfortable enough that I was able to sleep well on the seat. The Indian food they catered was warm and delicious but their items are always exactly the same every time I've flown on the same flight. The entertainment system is really pathetic in terms of the screen quality it is so small and unclear that it could possibly strain one's eyes badly and the touch screen is also very unresponsive. I've flown on another Malaysian airline flight from Hyderabad to KL in brand new B737-800. That was a very good flight with nice IFE and it had it had USB slot luckily as my phone battery was dead.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;Flew AMS-KUL on MH19 on what was a very old cabin and seat (777-200). Cabin crew were not at all welcoming on boarding the plane and this just set the scene for the whole flight. The seat is an angle lie flat very uncomfortable and not a seat I have used in about 10 years of flying in business. Also wasn't offered a mattress for the seat. The TV screen was small and low resolution the headphones cheap plastic not noise cancelling and with a poor connection which affected the sound quality. Food was ok however the nasi lemak for breakfast came with a watery curry sauce and was poorly presented. My biggest gripe is reserved for the cabin crew who seemed to want to do the minimum possible they offered the minimum of drink services the seat belt sign was kept on for almost the entire flight meaning they refused to make hot drinks although apart from this restriction all the passengers and crews seemed to ignore the seat belt sign and walked about as normal. Yes I know its the flight deck that switches the sign on however the flight had next to no turbulence. Overall this was the worst business class flight I have ever been on. Their competition is supposed to be Cathay/Singapore/Emirates but they came nowhere near those airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;KL to MEL 4th Jan. Flight was 45 mins late leaving but these things happen. Crew were very attentive throughout the flight. They really couldn't do enough for you. Meals were quite good and the drinks flowed freely. Water was constantly topped up and always done with a smile. We have flown MAS quite a lot in the last few years and never had any complaints. It is the crew that contributes to a pleasant flight and this crew was no exception. We traveled on the A330-300 and the seats are not so comfortable.;POSITIVE

Their competition is supposed to be Cathay/Singapore/Emirates but they came nowhere near those airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;KL to MEL 4th Jan. Flight was 45 mins late leaving but these things happen. Crew were very attentive throughout the flight. They really couldn't do enough for you. Meals were quite good and the drinks flowed freely. Water was constantly topped up and always done with a smile. We have flown MAS quite a lot in the last few years and never had any complaints. It is the crew that contributes to a pleasant flight and this crew was no exception. We traveled on the A330-300 and the seats are not so comfortable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;KUL-PER the trip was very comfortable on an otherwise fully filled flight. We enjoyed not being squashed into a budget airline. We looked forward to our meals but my wife found the choice of a spicy chicken curry or fish to not be much of a choice. She chose the chicken and found it too hot to be edible. Surely on a route that has many non Malaysians flying on it a non spicy non fish meal could be offered. I ordered a vegetarian but was disappointed to find it mainly to be pasta and mushrooms. The gate check-in in KL was unbelievably slow close to 90 minutes to check everyone in.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;17 Dec MH 1140 KUL-PEN. MH 1167 PEN-KUL. Both flights were on time. They are using the B738 with new Boeing interior. I was very happy with the MH service for a 45 minute flight. Flight from KUL-PEN was full but cabin crew managed it professionally. Will flying again with this airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-19;Very good first experience on MAS SIN-KUL-KIX on economy and return on business. Check-in at SIN was fast hassle-free and baggage was released timely at KIX airport. It was an overnight flight on New Year's Eve and clock struck 12 a while after take off so pilot wished us a Happy New Year and we happened to be able to see fireworks in the distance from our windows. Refreshments (a tuna croissant and drinks) were served about 45 mins after take off shortly after cabin lights were dimmed for pax sleeping. Lights gradually turned on (instead of a flick - from total darkness to instant brightness) and breakfast served 1.5hrs before landing. Took the Nasi Lemak set and it tasted pretty good. Check-in at KIX was done really swiftly (less than 10 minutes) staff was courteous and welcoming. Did not get to use the lounge as I was running late. Seats reclined comfortably duvet was soft and comfortable. Drinks and nuts served before flight took off. Food commenced shortly after flight took off. Appetizer was Beef and Chicken satay too much sauce for me but delicious nonetheless. Next up was the soba + mini sandwiches + smoked salmon/chicken breast appetizer. Main course was beef tenderloin. Dessert (I requested for it to be served 2hrs before landing) was a slice of pie/cake with blueberry sauce. I had a good rest on the 8hrs flight to KUL. Flight attendants were attentive and smiley. Would definitely fly MAS again if I have the chance.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-14;I flew CGK-KUL-PEN vv. When I was waiting for the CGK-KUL flight MH send an sms which they informed that my KUl- PEN flight would be delayed for 2 hours. Later the captain informs the reason of the delay and apologize. The sandwich served between CGK-KUL was fine. One of the male crew was rude and never smiled at all. The others were fine. All aircraft was new 737 with sky interior except for PEN-KUL flight which is an old 737. Overall MH is fine.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-14;MNL-KL-CDG Dec. 20 2014 and returned Jan. 4 2015. The trip to Paris was delayed from Manila and we were concerned that we might either miss the flight to Paris or our baggage might get delayed. Luckily this didn't happen. We also had chef on call meals which was a good option. The flight from KL-CDG used the A380 and it was a good experience for us overall. However on the return flight we tried to request the meal via email but their office was closed since they only work Monday to Friday Malaysian time. We asked at check-in but it was too late. No amenities onboard - when I asked the staff they said they were forgotten by the airline. We arrived into KL with about an hour to spare before the next flight (this was meant to be a 2 hour layover) but when we arrived in Manila our luggage was not with us. The plane from KL to Manila was old and dirty.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-14;KL to Melb. 4th Jan. Flight delayed by 45 mins but these things happen. The staff were very attentive and happy going about their job. Meals were of quite a good standard and the drinks flowed freely. Water was topped up on a regular basis and always done with a smile. Have travelled with MAS quite a lot over the last few years and never had any problems they are a great airline and would not hesitate to use them in the future. We did travel on the A330-300 and I find the seats quite uncomfortable 777 seats are a lot more comfortable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-14;Flew KL-CDG with their A-380. On the flight to Paris the trip was mostly good. Staff were good with their service. Seat lie flat but a bit hard on the back. Lower feet portion has no problem. Food was ok Inflight entertainment was good. However on our return flight the toiletries is missing. Slippers were not given. Staff were attentive to our needs but you can see that quality of service is not there. Toilets are not being cleaned so you go in with wet floors. Some of the toilets are closed because the flush is not working. Not your typical business class service and comfort. So much lacking on this Airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-14;Ho Chi Minh City to Kuala Lumpur on December 29 2014. The only 4 check-in counters open and I had to wait approx. 45 mins although only about 10 people queuing. The flight used a B737-800 and the crew were good. The magazines and newspapers were in a bad shape. The food were good (didn't get any options since they were running out of food). The luggage took another 45 minutes to come out.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-11;Very nice trip with MAS. First trip ever with them. First economy onward journey AMS-KUL-DPS and Business return. In a very empty business class (4 out of 30 seats were occupied) we travelled with a 6 month very comfortably. Staff was nice and accommodating. Only con was the food we are vegetarians and they catered for religious vegetarians. Well cannot blame them as it is difficult to cater for us. The trip went very well lounge access priority baggage handling. Will definitely fly again with MAS.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-11;"LHR-KUL on 3rd January - check in at LHR was very slow indeed with only one biz class counter open initially. The lounge was fine busy but space to sit offering a good breakfast selection for the 10.50am flight. Friendly welcome on board (much better than the outbound 2 weeks ago when the unfriendly stewardess at the door looked at my boarding pass and simply said ""This way"" and pointed - no smile or greeting of any kind.) The upper deck cabin is comfortable and spacious and the window seats have loads of storage space. The seat was OK but I didn't really find it particularly comfortable for sleeping even with the mattress topper. A bigger softer pillow would have been good. The crew was very proactive and efficient throughout the flight. The chef on call service worked fine and the food was pretty good with a decent snack bar set up at the front mid flight. The IFE was just ok - seemed to be a lot of the same selection as there was in December. KUL-CGK on 737-800 was fine - much more comfortable than European short haul in J class. Overall it was a good experience - I'd happily choose Malaysian again if fares are competitive.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;Flew from Helsinki to Bangkok via Frankfurt and Kuala Lumpur and return to Helsinki via Kuala Lumpur and London Heathrow. Frankfurt to Kuala Lumpur was one the most enjoyable flights ever. Extremely friendly crew excellent food drinks we're offered all the time including beer and wine. Snack box was given and flight was in time. The seat comfort was excellent even though the B777-200 shows its age. Return flight from KUL to London was a totally different experience. The seats are not very comfortable more cramped however the IFE is better. The A380 is a beauty to fly as silent as flying can be. Crew was not friendly. Food was bad reminding me food that you get in a short haul flight. No snack box was offered just some cookies and apples in a basket. Selection of drinks more limited. In general I was looking forward to the flight but MAS seems hit and miss. KUL is an easy airport for transit and I would use Malaysia Airlines again. I know they are trying to save money and I don't mind less IFE and less food but what I mind is warmth and friendliness of the crew.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;Economy Class from KUL-SYD. I fly this route regularly. Glad to see they finally changed the menu after a few years. IFE selection was fairly poor for New Release Movies but the rest was OK. Seat very uncomfortable. Crew were very abrupt and rude. I interacted with 5 on this flight and they all were very rude and seemed annoyed by every request. MAS is a very average airline but I have no choice on this route.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;Malaysia Airlines has become one of the the worst airlines to travel. I and my family travelled from Bali to Bengaluru recently and the flight was delayed by over 6 hours. The airline didn't inform the passengers through SMS/Email nor display the revised travel times in the airport monitors but kept delaying the time of the flight. We missed the connecting flight from KL and had to wait until the morning in the airport for the next flight. There was no one in KL airport to guide on transit visa/hotel facilities for the night. The staff were clueless and disorganized both at Bali and KL airports. There was no senior staff to organize alternate facilities or inform the travellers. Not recommended.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;I flew MH from Perth to KL and again KL to Siem Reap. Normally I would fly QF to. Sin but they no longer offer full service flights out of Perth. Anyway MH offered a flight at a reasonable hour of the day and a good price. The plane was fine the flight into KL early and essentially turbulence free despite warnings. Seat comfort is just OK. The biggest complaint is with the quality of the service. Staff seemed surly and uninterested. Food quality was also average whilst the drinks seemed positively stingy. Wine was very cheap quality and when I asked for a soft drink I got a glass mostly full of ice with a dash of coke and no can to refill the glass. Give me the whole can. Could also increase frequency of water handouts especially one just before descent. The flying was ok but a little more effort would go a long way.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;Flew from London to KL and back both ways on the top deck of the A380. The cabin crew were OK polite and friendly. There were frequent food and drink runs so I didn't need to bring out the snacks I had brought with me. There was plenty to watch in the IFE system. The seats were fine considering this was economy with enough leg room as long as you don't get someone in front of you reclining their seat for the whole flight!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2015-01-05;Business Class in A330 and A380 LHR/KL/SYD return. Definitely a long way short of the mark in just about every aspect. The business class seats in the A330 are not good at all and don't afford comfort in just about any position. The A380 seat is acceptable but a long way short of the major players such as SQ/EH /Cathay. The entertainment system had a pretty ordinary selection of movies. There were not a lot to choose from or someone at Malaysian has a love of sci-fi and kids movies. Food very ordinary and the Book the Chef a waste of time. Of the 4 meals two of my booked meals arrived. The lounge in KL is way way way short of the mark. Would I fly them again? No.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-31;MEL-KUL-PVG return. This is my first trip with Malaysia. All flights were punctual. Planes were clean but a bit old which takes away from elegance and presentation. The food was delicious but the drink selection was somewhat limited. The entertainment system was not up to scratch. Most movies were old and choice of video games was limited. The music system was fine. The toilets at the back of the plane were small. There is nothing wrong with Malaysia Airlines but nothing to inspire either. They do a good job at providing basic service (nothing exceptional). Value for money it is excellent.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-31;Phnom Penh - KL - Bali on 20th Dec. Nice new Boeing plane very good inflight system with reasonable films polite crew clean plane. Food was fine given each leg was relatively short. Perfectly happy with Malaysian and will fly with them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-31;SIN-KUL-CDG and same for return. Flight from SIN-KUL and vice versa expected to be full. Efficient service but experience marred with passengers who clearly don't understand the meaning of checking in their bags. Single aisle plane meant that if you are at the back of the plane be prepared. To wait for the passengers upfront to get offload their bags from the overhead cabins. In all not airline fault but idiotic passengers. KUL-CDG flight was not full thus my partner and I had an empty seat between us. This improved our mood for the long 13hrs flight to Paris. Cabin crews were excellent engaging us with small talks n such. No problem with food onboard. CDG-KUL flight was full and I was sandwiched between my partner and a dude. Just got a nasty shock that when I opened the magazine holder there were used tissue. Again not cabin crew's fault instead the ground handling staffs at Paris for not cleaning the plane properly. Requested for cabin crew to clear the tissue away and she apologized profusely for the oversight which I think was very sincere. The breakfast on plane was god-sent which was nasi lemak and sambal shrimp. After having days of non-spicy food (mustard is crap btw) the breakfast served was attuned to my taste even though I tasted better nasi lemak I have no complains here. All in all MAS may find a supporter in me who will forgo SIA for better fares.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-31;"Flew SIN-KUL-AMS on December 23 2014. The SIN to KUL was delayed for an hour but it was okay because we were flying Business. We stayed in the lounge while waiting. Lounge was very quiet with total of 6 passengers using it. Food and drinks selection was okay. We loved the satay and wines. Flight was quick comfortable seats and with some refreshment. It was with a new plane B737-800. Service was excellent! KUL-AMS was also delayed for 45 minutes. They could not get a clearance for take off and also waiting for other delayed passengers (like us). The transfer was nicely organized. It was with B772ER an old plane. Small personal screens limited and not so great selection of movies/entertainment. Food was fish or chicken. I chose fish which was overcooked. It was served with veggies that were very salty. Breakfast was Nasi Lemak or Omelette. The omelette was nice served with sausage and hash brown. My partner chose Nasi Lemak and it was very spicy for breakfast. Seats were comfortable in the economy although it can be improved and need some cleaning. It was lots of leg space for tall guys like me(40D). We had 4 rows on our own although It was a busy flight. Service was not impressive. After serving the supper most of cabin crews disappeared. They served only one round of drinks throughout the flight. We had to look for them in the pantry area if we need something. Also no snacks were offered in between. One of the cabin crews even asked me ""Boss what do you want?"" We normally take Singapore Airlines and KLM. We took MH because of the pricing. Malaysia Airlines is far from this two in terms of comfort food service and fleet maintenance. I'm a little worried now on my flight back to KUL and to SIN. I hope its a different plane a newer one.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-31;Flew from KUL to AMS in Business Class with MH Upgrade on a 777. Lovely experience. Was a bit wary of the angle lie flat seats but as there was an empty seat next to me I had an extra pillow to put under my feet making me lie in a 180 degree position. Slept for eight hours and was very comfortable. Very attentive and friendly FA's. Having flown the first leg AKL to KUL in Economy I couldn't help noticing a difference in attitude between the two crews. In EC they seemed to be going through the motions. Fair enough they did what they were supposed to do but they could have smiled. Having said that I will continue to use and recommend MH. Not only do they offer very competitive prices and a speedy connection to New Zealand they also deserve support after this year's horrific events.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-22;Flew four legs MAA-KUL-BKK KBV-KUL-MAA in October/November 2014 - a total of about ten hours flying. All flights in Business all in 737-800's. Found it all to be a superior experience - from check in to land and air staff to cleanliness of planes to entertainment (a bit limited but these are 737s) to timeliness. The golden lounge at KUL is excellent - very bright and clean good wifi decent food clean showers. All of it puts North American airlines to shame. I would happily use MH next time I'm in SE Asia.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-22;Very poor experience. Flight delayed on 11 December out of Saigon by 2 hours. They said they would hold the connecting flight to London and that ground staff in KL (their home airport) would be on hand. None of this was true. No information given on the flight about connections. Nobody available on their transfer desk for an hour to sort out issues and took two hours to get transferred overnight to a hotel and re-ticketed. Nobody took responsibility and the duty manager declined to come down and deal with the issues.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-22;BNE to SIN via KUL. Excellent flight. The business cabin in the new A330 is really good and the crew is very accommodating. The satay is also extremely delicious. The 15.4 inch AVOD screen also had a good selection of movies. The amenity kit was the star of the evening. It had everything you could think and couldn't think of.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-18;The staff were not friendly for welcoming the customers onboard. The staff did not guide the customers to their seats. Furthermore the cabin crew missed some rows while serving the drinks. The choice of drinks is very limited as well. No biscuit and no bread served but just a small packet of peanuts. The legroom in economy seat was not good. The lavatory was fairly clean. However the ticket price was very reasonable and affordable.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-18;KUL-SYD. enjoyed Flight except two problems - meal request not available (a first in business class) and FA's disappeared for three hours which happens in a night flights but this was an all day flight. Otherwise good value.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-10;Flying from Singapore to Beijing on 03 November 2014 (MH606 and MH360) and returning on 12 November 2014 (MH361 and MH611) with transit at Kuala Lumpur. 3 of the 4 sectors were near to perfection. Most of the cabin crews were polite. The food and beverage served on board were nice and tasty. The only problem to be mentioned could be the malfunction toilet at the rear of the cabin on the Singapore - Kuala Lumpur sector (MH606).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-10;LHR-KUL-AKL-KUL-LHR. A mixed bag. Positives: The A380s are superb esp in top deck economy and they have a very good IFE (if limited in choice compared with EK's). The service was fine and I got this at an excellent fare. Areas which need work: you can't choose your seating online as with EK and have to go through the airline instead. the online check in asks you to print your boarding passes but (at AKL anyway) these had to be reprinted - took extra time. the IFE on the B777 services (to/from AKL) is now next to obsolete and is very limited in its selection. I would fly with them again but they are still somewhat behind the 8-ball.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-10;I was on MH132 AKL to KL on 26th November. My bid for an upgrade was accepted so I was in Business Class on the 777-200. I only have praise for the crew the food the comfort and the whole experience. The seats are angle flat but I was able to have at least 6 hours of sleep. I also used the Chef-on-Call option and the food I ordered was really good. Very attentive and friendly crew as well.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-10;I flew from Heathrow to Sydney stopping over in Kuala Lumpur for 2nights 3days. On my return trip I travelled back on my own. My family upgraded me to business class with assistance in place because of health issues. I was looked after from start to finish the service and staff were excellent I have flown with them before and would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-04;KUL-BKI-KUL (transit in LBU and MYY on the way back). Pleasant experience in all sectors. Good food generous portion. Aircraft clean crews very attentive and helpful. No hotels for transit passengers (more than 6hrs). MH should look on this matter as other major airlines do provide accommodation for transit customers.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-01;I flew FRA-KUL-SIN with Malaysia on the 23rd of November 2014 in economy and it has been a good experience: The seating in the 777-200 is really good - I like the 2-5-2-configuration at least as long as my wife and I get on the double seats at the windows sitting in the row of 5 would be bothersome on the other hand sitting at the window in a 3-3-3 configuration is nearly the same - 2 persons have to rise if you want to get out. The seat comfort is excellent. I'm traveling a lot and the pitch of 34 inches in economy is world-class in addition to that the seats even if they look a little bit worn have a lumbar support and a good recline. The screens for the IFE are very small but the choice of movies is great so this is ok. The food was the best I ever had in economy class warm tasty and enough staff offered drinks all the time even the wine was of good quality. The only point that should be better is the kindliness if the staff - they did what they had to do but there was no smile at all. The flight KUL-SIN was on a brand-new 737-800 and very short not much to say about that.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-12-01;"Flew LHR-KUL-PER on MH3 and MH125 with my wife and 2 year old son. Contrary to what I read about MAS' policy on seating children on top deck in economy I was happy that we had been seated there in the middle row of 4 seats. I was even happier when before take off the stewardess moved the gentleman sat next to us to an exit seat so that we all had more room he was also very pleased. The cabin decor I must say is fantastic compared to the SQ route we took last year it is far ahead. Both planes were also in very good condition compared to other airlines on similar routes e.g. EK and SQ. The seats were well designed but as Mr Walsh has pointed out previously they are not as good as the old 747 seats on older MAS flights. I am also 6""3' and we are talking about economy after all so it can only be bearable. The food on the flight was pretty good for economy there were plenty of beverages served throughout the flight and my wife's veg and sons child's meal were always served first and his tray was always cleared before the remainder of the cabin. The only thing that's worth pointing out is that on EK and SQ for such a long flight there is usually a selection of sandwiches to snack on however we were only given chocolate bars and crips which I thought was a bit cheap. Appreciate the airline is struggling financially but I fail to see how depriving passengers on which is already a long and tiring flight a decent snack. The cabin crew were polite but lacked the Malaysian hospitality that I have come to expect from MAS. Having flown with them regularly since 2004 they were not quite up to the previous standard. They were not rude or anything like that just that they were going through their motions as quickly as possible. Considering the cost of the tickets were several hundred pounds less than SQ or EK I would definitely recommend MH.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-25;20th Nov 2014 MH002 Kuala Lumpur (dep 2355) to London Heathrow. Minus points: 1) Uncomfortable seat. I generally find seating less supportive and comfortable than those used on MH and SQ's 747-400 fleets of yesteryear and I have found the seating on SQs and MH's A380 and QR's A330 and A340 to be much of the same. This particular seat felt like it was worn down and it was the emergency exit row seat 42K which I had paid extra for so this was particularly annoying. 2) Cold cabin but nowhere near as cold as the outbound MH001 flight I took on 31st October which I also reviewed. 3) As mentioned in my aforementioned review of the 31st October MH001 flight the in-flight entertainment is lagging behind - slow poorly laid out and not intuitive. Plus points: 1) Attentive and friendly cabin crew as ever. 2) Informative and friendly Captain. 3) Good quality food. 4) The content of in-flight entertainment is sound. General thoughts: An enjoyable flight again but one in which I could not sleep well or get comfortable in. In-flight service is exemplary.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-20;SYD-LHR-SYD in Business Class. SYD-KUL-SYD on A330-300 and KUL-LHR-KUL on A380. All flights on time. Aircraft on all four flights were new and clean. Cabin crew were excellent on all flights. They were polite helpful friendly and always addressed me by name. Booked meals via Chef-on-call all of which were honoured. Meals were tasty and of a decent portion. IFE was AVOD and had a reasonably good selection of latest releases as well as older favourites. Seats on the A330-300 were comfortable in the sitting and reclining positions but are angled flat and not that comfortable for sleeping. Storage space is severely lacking in these seats. Seats on the A380 are far superior. They are very comfortable in all positions and are completely flat which allowed me to get a good amount of sleep. There is also an excellent amount of storage space especially for window seats. MAS now provide covers for their business class seats that help to smooth out the seat and add a little more padding. Bathrooms were always kept clean on all flights. Priority for premium classes and elite level passengers was provided when available for things such as check-in security and immigration boarding disembarking baggage delivery and customs. Overall an excellent product that is let down a little by the seats on their A330-300 which really need to be completely flat. My only other suggestion for MAS would be to serve champagne as a pre-departure beverage as it is currently their policy not to. Otherwise it was an excellent flight experience from beginning to end and it was also competitively priced which made it excellent value for money. I would not hesitate to fly with them.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-20;31st Oct 2014 Flight: MH001 London Heathrow (2200 dep) to Kuala Lumpur. Minus points: 1) This was nowhere near a full flight yet when serving dinner shortly after take-off they quickly ran out of one of the two standard options on offer. 2) The cabin was very cold. I was in the window seat 43K and had no one sat next to me so I turned off all 3 vents and used to blankets despite wearing 3 layers including my hoody with the hood up. Still cold. 3) The in-flight entertainment user interface sorely needs updating - it is slow cumbersome and far from intuitive and there really isn't a need for the old-style dual-hole headphone jacks to be retained. Refer to Dragonair as an example of a modern system. Plus points: 1) Cabin crew friendly as ever MH's true asset. 2) Nice in-flight meals although the dinner option that was left (tuna lasagne) might be considered an acquired taste. 3) Despite criticisms of in-flight entertainment there was ample content and of a wide range. General notes: Contrary to what my notes and scores might suggest I did enjoy this flight and very much looked forward to it - my first flight with MH in 7 years and my first on their A380. But flying with them certainly isn't the experience that it used to be. I had flown on 31 MH flights prior to this and can say that they deserved those Skytrax 5-Star Airline ratings but right now they're not quite there. A simple measure like not running out of certain food on a 2/3 full flight would help as something like that isn't acceptable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-17;Travelled KL to Adelaide on 11/11/2014. Seats OK but sleep quality poor. Cabin crew polite but impersonable - no warmth or sincerity - travelled Economy Class and I felt that we were made to feel that way. Instead of serving peanuts to passengers first drinks (water/juice) should be served first. Refreshments seemed to take aeons to arrive. Food unappetizing. Breakfast of a chicken/tuna sandwich short of appalling. Toilets were not spruced up during the course of the flight OR if they were poor job was done - they were disgusting by the time the flight approached Adelaide. In short irrespective of fares I will never fly MAS again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-17;Flew SIN-KUL-HCM-KUL-DXB-KUL-SIN. All economy class. Clean modern planes. Seating on the B737 was a bit tight but the longhaul A330 was quite spacious even for a tall person like me. On all flights the staff were warm friendly and efficient. No request was too much trouble. Food and entertainment were good. MAS seems to have gotten its groove back.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-12;MH726 and MH764 on October 28 2014 from Jakarta to Siem Reap via Kuala Lumpur and flew back to Kuala Lumpur on MH765 on October 30 2014. In essence meal given to us was pretty simple. Simpler than a couple years ago. Pudding was not the fresh one - looked like it was made in a factory. Meal was presented in small box with two options to choose. Drink service was fine. Service given by the cabin crews varied. Some were nice some were not in the mood and some looked unhappy. It seemed there was no set standard. The cabin was clean and in flight entertainment was fine on new B737-800 Series (there was no personal TV on MH726 unfortunately and the cabin looked rather old). On the way back to Jakarta on MH727 on October 31 2014 the flight was very full. Long queues at the gate and flight boarded 40 minutes late.;NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2014-11-12;SYD-KL-HAN. Extremely disappointed in the MA service. We ordered vegetarian meals on all four flights however there was a huge mix-up and were given everything but vegetarian meals. We called the booking line when we arrived at our destination to make sure that our meals were vegetarian on the way back. They confirmed that they would be. We got on our return flight and we were only served one vegetarian meal and one meal with meat. We spoke to the air hostess who said it was our fault because we didn't order a vegetarian meal with our booking. This was incorrect. Treating us as hindrances rather than being accommodating or apologetic the attendant offered the staff meal which was vegetarian slop served cold. As you can imagine we were extremely unimpressed. Further the MA planes are dated and seating is uncomfortable. The attendants don't clean the toilets throughout the flight so the floors were wet and the toilets smelt. Hands down the worst four flights of my life and will never fly MA again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-11;I recently flew from Tokyo to Melbourne via Kuala Lumpur with Malaysian in Business Class. The whole experience was great well organised boarding smart attentive crew who really seemed to enjoy their job-unlike many European airlines when you seem to be an inconvenience to the crew. The meals served on both sectors were the best I had ever experienced in Business Class and I have flown on some of the big players in Europe and the USA. I was. Pleased to see the flight full and will be using Malaysian whenever possible in the future.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-06;Flew MH143 from SYD-KUL early in October in economy. The meal service was a very small portion. I was surprised to find that the second meal was just a pastry and a beverage! The return leg was the same - breakfast was another pastry. I often fly SYD-SIN-KUL with another airline and get two full meals on the long sector. This time I chose to support MH following the two recent disasters. I truly wish the airline a very prosperous future but inflight catering must be improved.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-03;Mumbai to Siem Reap Via KL and back in economy. We managed to do a seat reservation all the way so we got the seats we wanted. Strangely the website would not let me do this and finally I called the office in Mumbai and they did the same for us. Flight from BOM to KUL was uneventful as its a night flight. Food served after take off and was quite awful. The BOM to KUL route is served by what seems like a very tired and old 777 and the 2-5-2 seating is great if you booked the 2 but seemed crammed for the rest. Leg room good. PTV options okay. From KUL to REP the flights were on a 737. Lunch served- once again the food was terrible. Staff and service all the way through was okay - nothing outstanding. Packed flight on all 4 sectors. Main reason for choosing MAS was the price was the cheapest way to get to Cambodia from India.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-11-03;MH143 on 7/10/2014. Just flew KL to Sydney. Service food and inflight entertainment were excellent. Flight was 100% full. Will definitely continue to support MAS.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-31;KUL-ADL return out on 18 Oct and return on 25 Oct. Outbound flight was a red eye. On the outbound sector service was generally good albeit a little perfunctory by a male flight attendant who was occasionally a little rushed and gruff. Otherwise the rest of the staff were great. In contrast to previous journeys there was no rush to get the meal service over. There was a good choice of wine and spirits. Inflight entertainment was extensive but not to my liking but that's a personal choice. They supply you with a duvet pillows and a rather sad amenity bag which is embarrassingly cheap and tacky (apart from the creams and moisturizers). The seat is angled flat and is terrible for sleep. I am 183 cm tall and was constantly sliding down and ended up setting the chair at an armchair recline to try and get some sleep. The return flight was great just 6 people in business class so there was lots of attention and the attendants were truly warm and friendly . They got it right in that they were unobtrusive but yet managed to keep their eye on your glass and plate offering second helpings of food and topping up wine regularly. I used the book-the-cook service and my main meal of nasi lemak was just okay nothing special. Bear in mind that nasi lemak out of Adelaide is not to be recommended! Generally I was quite satisfied apart from the angled-flat seats. MAS do something about these seats in your A330's!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-28;Flew MAS on 1st September Penang to Kuala Lumpur and then Kuala Lumpur to Kuching. Price was reasonable and cheaper than AirAsia surprisingly. Check-in was alright. Food was nice. Only peanut and fruit juice were served on flight from Penang to KL but I think it's sufficient for a short flight. Took only 25 minutes for the flight to fly from Penang to KL. I noticed they no longer produce their own peanut butter it's now supplied by a Malaysian company unrelated to MAS. The only complaint on this flight was the extremely rough landing. Flight from KL to Kuching was nice. Flight attendants were nice. Choice of food was either frittata or nasi lemak. Frittata was not served hot sadly and the potato wedges were soggy. Besides that I have no other complaints. MAS may be going through a difficult time but it is coping well in my opinion. I'll definitely fly MAS again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-28;Flew 18 Oct MH127 KUL-PER. Got lucky by the airline upgrade program and sat on business class 1st row. Food was plentiful and entertainment system was full with many latest movies. Temperature in the cabin were a bit too low. The journey was smooth throughout but the landing was rough. The weather at airport was bad and with the pilot aborted landing at 1st attempt. Loud applause could be heard when the pilot landed the plane safely after 2nd attempt. As a frequent flyer this was a memorable experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-22;Flew MH31 IST to KLIA 11/10/14 then MH135 to BNE. Flights on time. Service and all crew excellent. Good food and beverage. This airline is really trying. We could not have had better or easier flights.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-22;Melbourne - Frankfurt (Return). The flights to Germany were actually quite good. Was in a Boeing 777-200 and while the plane was probably a little old the seats were comfortable with good leg room and entertainment was fine. Flights ran on time and service was professional and attentive. I will say that that the fact that the flight was not full helped as I was able to get two seats to myself. With food an important point to realise is that the food is usually made and loaded onto the plane at the departure point. So the Melbourne - KL food was good but the food from KL to FRA was fairly ordinary. On the way back FRA to KL was fine but the KL to Melbourne flight was pretty bad. Service was poor and sloppy food was dreadful seats uncomfortable (expected given it was an airbus). It seemed to be more of a code share flight as most passengers were Sri Lanka Airlines and KLM passengers connecting to Melbourne. Would fly again but choose my flights a bit more carefully next time. Not as good as it was about 18 months ago but standards haven't fallen away that much. I left in September and came back in October yet had the same entertainment program on outbound and inbound which wasn't too pleasing given long hauls involved.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-22;Was on board MH2047 SDK-BKI on 17 Oct 2014. Was a 737-800 not a full flight. FA was great. Drinks was serve twince. IFE was so- so as not headphone was gived. USB Port was not in working condition. Flight took off and landed early. KKIA was like a dead town - peace and quiet.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-22;BKK-KUL-SIN-KUL-SIN in Business. Great value for money. Service from check-in staff and on-board was just excellent.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-20;KUL-KTM 9 Oct MH 114. Below average service from the FA and disgusting food. It took them an hour and a half after takeoff to serve meals and there was no turbulence to delay it. Platinum status not acknowledged as well as names not used at all by the unfriendly lead stewardess and her crew. It's a pity the way this once great airline is headed.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-15;SGN-KUL-SGN on 11-12 October 2014. There were very few passengers on the first flight (Boeing 737-800) 5 in business and approx. 15 in economy. Second flight were full in economy due to a large Malaysian sports team Service and FA in business was top notch in both directions! Special meal provided perfectly food options available wine-list and champagne though the flight lasts 1½hour only. Real business seats in old solid style (reclining). IFE and headphones worked fine. Tables are small and not very stable. KUL Malaysia Airlines' Golden Satay Lounge in KUL is airy spacious and very good. Space for approx. 250 pax I slept there overnight in the Relaxation Room (4 beds) had shower and local hot food (some 3 dishes offered) MH is still bleeding as there is only very few persons in the lounge partly because of weekend. This airline deserves to survive with glamour and is on par with QR and EK.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-13;KUL-CDG (Paris) A380-800 Upper Deck (31 August 2014) LHR (London)-KUL A380-800 Upper Deck (7 September 2014). Very good service for both route. But a bit delay on arrival to Kuala Lumpur from London. Inflight entertainment should be upgraded.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-12;"MAS is truly an airline that has lost its way. For long-haul they used to be a byword for comfort and good service with their old 747s having a greater-than-average seat pitch. Since taking delivery of their A380s this has all changed for the worse. Seats are now as crammed-in as with almost all airlines but worse still are actually uncomfortable to sit on. Cabin service is far worse with many staff appearing to wish they were anywhere but on duty with MAS. Meal quality is mediocre except for special meals that are generally good. Added to all this are very high fares and what I regularly find to be the worst and most unworkable website of all the airlines I have used in the electronic ticket age. ""MH"" is supposed to mean ""Malaysian Hospitality"" - but the Malaysian government might like to lean on this airline to make this a realistic claim if they really want people to visit Malaysia. Sorry MAS but you are a once-good now poor airline.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-12;MH127 KUL-PER 3 Oct. The flight was full. No empty seats. Excellent service by flight crews. The crews looked tired but that didn't impact the overall service. Only setback was the cabin aircon was not working when boarding. The ground power supply wasn't working. The temperature in the cabin were too hot. The plane departed 15 minutes late. Otherwise overall service was excellent will fly again on MH.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-12;10th Sept MH134 BNE to KUL then 11th Sept MH004 KUL to LHR. We fly annually with MAS to Europe. Earlier this month we flew BNE to LHR changing aircraft at KUL. Cabin crew were better than ever. On the A330 they now supply a slipover quilt which stops any sliding on the angled seat. Crew clearly worried about retrenchments in the current environment. Our flights were excellent in every way. I hope the public give MAS the support it deserves.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-12;My husband and I flew London - Phuket in September and returned in October. We thought both flights were great. The staff were really friendly and were more than happy to help with any issues we had. Had no complaints at all.;POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2014-10-08;Two flights from Amsterdam to Manila. First flight to Kuala Lumpur MH19. Flight was comfortable staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was nice as far as plane food goes. Aircraft is getting a little old but it didn't effect the comfort. Second connection flight was MH806. The plane was modern and comfortable. Food was okay and staff were friendly. Biggest compliment I could pay is how professional the staff are.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-08;"I am a frequent flyer with Malaysian Airlines and have been loyal to them during this last year but standards seem to be slowly declining. Yesterday I took the midday flight from London to KL. I declined a glass of wine with my lunch as it was too early in the day for me but a few hours later I fancied a drink so I went to the back of the upper deck and requested one. The flight attendant was preparing soft drinks and refused me any alcohol. ""It's finished"" she snapped. Is this a new policy? Also the air quality was noticeably poor. Maybe that's why the flight attendant was so grouchy.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-08;Used Malaysia Airlines to fly from Amsterdam to Denpasar return. The return flight was 2 hours late very little updated information from Kuala Lumpur. The food and the service was poor. The service compared with other airlines I flew before was nothing special. Very disappointed.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-08;I flew from London to Kuala Lumpur in August I have always flown MAS. Another great flight on time both ways. I only have praises for the very friendly and pleasant cabin crew. Drinks were served every hour and the food as fantastic. Inflight entertainment was great.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-05;I flew Brisbane to London via KL - return with Malaysian airlines and was more than happy with every aspect of the experience both on the A330 and the A380. I look forward to flying with them again as soon as possible.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-05;Just flew Adelaide/KL/Singapore with Malaysia Airlines and couldn't have been happier. Flights were great friendly efficient staff good meals and entertainment. With all the problems Malaysia Airlines have suffered this year I hope they keep flying. We will certainly book with them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-01;We did a Business Class flight from Frankfurt to Denpasar via Kuala Lumpur. The Chef-On Call service worked perfectly and the food was good in quality and taste. The staff were very friendly and always smiled. Each flight was operated with a Boeing 777-200. The seat were are good but not the newest ones. Unfortunately not fully flat when you want to sleep but still we could sleep about 8 hours non stop without disturbance and wake up relaxed. The onboard entertainment system is not the newest system anymore and did not offer a good range of movies. I have seen much betters in other airlines. But it worked without any issues. The service before the flight is great. All my requests were fulfilled and I received a reply on my emails within 12 hours usually.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-01;I regularly fly Malaysia Airlines and am usually pleased with their service but this time the abysmal service on my Bangalore-Kuala Lumpur flight needs reporting. I was placed on a seat in front of an exit row and was horrified to find the seat couldn't recline at all! To make matters worse the seat pitch was no different to some budget airline like Ryanair! Imagine being mashed up for 4 hours in a seat that wont recline while the seat in front of you is reclined all the way for 4 hours! By the end of the flight I was exhausted as it was so uncomfortable that I was unable to sleep squashed into the tiny seat with the TV screen mashed up to my face (meaning I couldn't watch anything without hurting my eyes). My back and neck still hurt even though it has been a day now. For those who are wondering I bought a full service Class L economy ticket not one of the ultra cheap H or K tickets so at the very least I should not have been stuck in such a seat! From now on I shall fly Singapore Airlines to Bangalore even though it means that I have to transit in Changi.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-10-01;Melbourne-KL-Bangkok return in economy. Flight from Melbourne to Kl was the 12.05 departure. A chicken roll with spicy relish was served as supper and a breakfast of continental or nasi lemak was served prior to landing in KL. On the flight from Kl to Bangkok a chicken roll was served with a piece of cake. I would rate the food as average there was nothing that stood out or was out standing. Staff were excellent and friendly and meal service was very efficient. My request for a scotch and coke was fulfilled promptly. Toilets were kept clean at all times. Cabin announcements were kept to a minimum to allow sleep. Seats were comfortable for economy with ample leg room. Good choice of movies and TV shows. On the return flight from KL to Melbourne a dinner was served of curry chicken with salad and sticky date pudding. This was by far the best meal our of all the planes. Plane was an older model so seats didn't recline but luckily plane wasn't full so could stretch out. Breakfast was a very bland chicken roll saw a lot of people have a bite and leave it aside. Service once again excellent. Overall a good experience the fares were about $400 cheaper than Thai and almost the same as Air Asia. I have flown them many times and the service is always without fault. All flights were full or close to full and left and arrived on time.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-28;KUL-JED-KUL MH150 and MH151. It was a fantastic trip for me and my family. The cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. The food were delicious. The IFE also very good with many choices of movies. I will definitely fly with Malaysia Airlines again in the future.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-22;MH122 (SYD-KUL A330-300) MH758 (KUL-SGN B737-800) MH765 (REP-KUL B737-800) MH141 (KUL-SYD A330-300) Business Class August/September. Despite their travails over the past months Malaysia still rates with the best the cabins were full both to KL and Saigon only 5 pax (out of 16 seats) from Siem Reap and 17 pax (out of 42 to Sydney). Check-in was hassle free at all locations with lounge access after border protection and security (note MH now use the QF Business Class lounge at SYD rather than their own lounge down in the bowels of Kingsford Smith). There was no priority boarding at KUL or REP but once on board service was exemplary on all sectors with friendly and attentive crews the exception was REP-KUL (2 flight attendants for 5 pax but no teamwork or co-operation rapid meal service CSM spent most of the flight reading his paper and no priority landing passes which meant almost 30 minutes to clear immigration at KUL - not good). Food and beverage was good with tasty meals the satay is always a winner and a good wine selection (interestingly wine wasn't offered with the 'lite meal' served before landing - dinner time - but available if requested however they embarrassingly ran out of all white wine on the SYD-KUL sector). The standard of catering on the two short sectors was astonishingly good. My only complaint would be that the meals were rushed when a more leisurely pace would have suited the time of day.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-22;Flew Malaysia Airlines recently on KUL-LHR-KUL on their flagship A380. Upper deck was a breeze and seats food and IFE was on par with the likes of the competitors. Crew were friendly pleasant and offered juice/drinks consistently every hour. Flight was slightly longer due to the new flight path which took longer than usual. The loads on KUL-LHR was 100% full and LHR-KUL was 90%. Transfer between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5 was a breeze at LHR. Good flight and excellent crew like always. Keep up the positive spirit.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-19;Flew domestic route Kota Kinabalu - Kuala Lumpur return with B737-800 (90-95% passengers load) and international Kuala Lumpur - Melbourne with A330 (60-70 % passengers load). I would said positive points were smooth check in on time flight welcoming cabin crews and good legroom. But I think MH needs some improvements with certain aspects if still want to stay in line with other legacy airlines such as SQ CX QR EK. These are things such as: food services. For instance for domestic 2.5 hr flight it is not reasonable to be served refreshments only. My meal from MEL-KUL was a tasteless nasi lemak. IFE was very good but would better if they have Malay subtitles for non Malay language movies. Otherwise satisfied with MH in general.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-17;AKL-KUL-AKL (1 July and 18 July 2014) on the Boeing 777-200. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was wide for an economy class. In terms of food I prefer the one from KUL as it is catered by Brahim's instead of the food that was catered at AKL's catering. The screen of the IFE was a too small in the 777 I hardly enjoyed the movies and expected to have more choices. However the audio on demand was up to date they have the latest album of my favorite singers. Cabin crew was friendly and they provided a very good service to all passengers.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-06;KUL-SIN Sunday noon departure. Online booking and check-in is easy enough with an added bonus of being able to drop off bags at the City Air Terminal at KL Sentral before boarding the airport train. After that it's a little disorganized. Boarding time is advertised far too early making passengers wait half outside the gate area for a second security screening and only then getting to wait with proper seating. The staff was OK though none too friendly. They handed out peanuts and drinks and that was it. I didn't mind choosing MH over similarly priced competition nor was the trip in any way memorable. Average in general.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-06;BKK-KUL-SYD-KUL-BKK. For the first leg BKK-KUL the flight was flown with a B737-800 and the leg room was comparable to a budget airline! Not quite what I expected! Food was just okay but it's just a short flight so nothing to complain about. The second leg KUL-SYD was excellent. Attentive and polite cabin crew for an overnight flight and the food was one of the best I've had. Flight arrived earlier than scheduled which was commendable. The return flight SYD-KUL was quite full and the cabin crew seems a little short tempered. My request for water was being brushed away by 1 cabin crew and the second cabin crew replied in a not so polite tone. I noticed that the crew was more friendly to non-Asians and I did not get a single smile from the 2 cabin crew that was tending to my row of seats. Food was great as usual but not the cabin crew. The last leg KUL-BKK was cancelled a few days before the flight and I was put to a flight the next morning about 11 hours away from the original flight. I had to book a room at the transit hotel at KLIA to spend the night. No compensation was made not even a free upgrade to Business Class. Again cabin crew put on long faces. If given a chance I would avoid flying with Malaysia Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-06;ICN-KUL A330 code share with Korean 8/26. It has been many years since I traveled with MH but considering the recent events I had no qualms about this trip. The price and flight schedules were right. Two FA seems sad and about to cry during the flight for some reasons. The rest were fine and professional. Service and food were okay. Flight left and landed on time luggage was present at the end of the trip. My section was 50-60% full mainly locals. I would fly with them again but will see how the recently announced cuts affect service.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-06;My husband flew from Perth to Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo to Los Angeles. When we got seated on the plane in Perth we had to use wipes to clean the surface in front of us and our tables as they were filthy. When we got seated on the plane at Kuala Lumpur we sat there for approximately in a hot plane without taking off for about thirty minutes then advised there was a technical problem and they were waiting for an engineer. We then sat in the hot plane for about another half an hour and not even offered a drink of water. Passengers had to go into the service areas and ask the hostesses for a drink. I understand planes do have problems from time to time but to not even be offered a drink. After about another half an hour we had to get off this plane and get onto another one. On the flights to Tokyo and the following one to Los Angeles the meals were disgusting and we are not fussy eaters at all but couldn't eat the meals. Also on these flights the rubbish incurred by the passengers was not once collected. On the ten hour flight Tokyo to Los Angeles we did not get one cup of tea or coffee. Every time it was time for tea or coffee they said they couldn't serve it because of impending turbulence which we are still waiting for. We flew home from Rome to Perth with Emirates and experienced a lot of turbulence but still received our tea and coffee. We were a bit hesitant going with Malaysian Airlines after the disappearance of their aircraft but did think they would go out of their way and offer a very good service but not to be. We will never fly with them again because of the dirty inedible food and shocking service on their flights.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-01;Flew LHR-KL-LHR on the A380 economy section of upper deck on both legs. The seats are comfortable enough but leg- room is still somewhat restricted. The cabin crew were attentive there were drinks brought around every hour during the flight. The food was standard airline fare but coming out of KL there was little choice it was 'spicy' or nothing - so I had nothing. Having said that most other passengers seemed to find something to eat. The upper deck is a pleasant experience it feels more spacious in economy because of the fewer number of seats. My main complaint would be the temperature it was bitterly cold initially with many passengers wrapped in blankets and coats. Surprisingly there was no amenity pack of any description in economy.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-01;KUL-LHR. Long 12 hour flight was slightly delayed. Nothing but praise for Malaysian airlines. Fantastic crew who did their job to the best ability. The Inflight entertainment on the A380 is the best I have experienced 200+ movies how could anyone get bored on a flight like that? Food was good too.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-01;KUL-KCH MH2520 19 August 2014. KCH-KUL MH2521 22 August 2014. Outbound flight almost half empty seats. Overall experience from the food IFE and crew services in term of friendliness is excellent. Inbound flight with less empty seats is similar to the outbound flight with the exception of cold sandwiches that were served to the passengers the overall experience is truly 5 star for 1.5 hour domestic flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-01;My partner and I flew from Kuala Lumpur to Sydney on August 21st. I found the food very ordinary and the Vegetable rolls are awful. I was so hungry after being awake all-night due to a child in the seat behind me continually kicking the back of my partners seat. The service is also average which is unfortunate. I spilt water all over me and looked for someone to help me maybe grab me a towel or something. I waited until an attendant came into view. I waved to him and smiled to let him know I needed him. He stood there looking at me then turned away. Totally ignored me. He eventually came. By the time he decided to come I had used the blanket to wipe up all the water. Not happy at all with service. I really would like to see airlines group families together a bit separate from adults traveling with no children and I feel it is really unfair to be kept awake all night and inconvenienced by badly behaved children. I can not see me flying Malaysia Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-09-01;How standards have slipped on MAS! Flew Brisbane-KUL on 15/08 and was on MAS again after using a number of other airlines for frequent trips up to S.E.Asia. We were not able to get the seats we requested and ended up way down the back. IF entertainment was limited and not all advertised choices were available. The food was terrible with 'dinner' being a small strip pie even the staff apologized when I questioned what they had served up to us. Breakfast was a little better. Drinks had to be requested and was limited to 2 serves only. Staff then retreated to their area and we're hardly seen for the rest of the flight. It is easy to see where MAS is heading but sad to see what was once a great airline drop its standards so much.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-28;KUL-CDG. A380 was good and flight was filled to the brim. I'm not a big fan of the hard seats but it wasn't hard to get a good night sleep. One of the 2 stewardess weren't very attentive and could have done better while the other one was fantastic. Food is great as usual and they offered drinks on several rounds. Check In is done via a kiosk now so things are faster.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-28;Flew CGK-KUL-CGK on MH710 and MH727 with their brand new B738. both flight departed and arrived on time. Flight service was great with courteous flight attendants and comfortable cabin. However they seem to cut expenses by offering much smaller inflight meals but still okay for the 2-hour flight. The main highlight of the trip was check in facility in KLIA Express station at KL Central which is really efficient and convenient. I paid MYR 35 for 30-minutes train to KLIA and was able to check in and check my baggage there at the station. Overall a pleasant experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-28;"KUL-CDG-KUL seated on A380 upper deck for both legs. Both flights left on time. Service provided by FAs and ground staff was friendly helpful and courteous. Never heard a rude word uttered or given any dirty looks as commented by some of the other reviewers. IFE was adequate and contained ample media to listen/read/watch. Late supper and breakfast were served hot on both flights and were quite tasty. Snack boxes were handed out mid flight with FAs serving drinks nearly every hour throughout the flight. Snacks and drinks were also readily available for selection in the rear galley area. On to the minor negative comments. Though there was plenty of legroom our seats were very stiff and hard on this 388. Hard to sleep on for long haul flights if you're even able to sleep at all. My previous flights on the MH 772s and 744s had much comfy-er seats than this plane. The seat back pockets and also additional window seat storage had food crumbs and dried ""goo"" and needed a good vacuum and wipe.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-28;Just flown MEL-KUL-CDG in business class. 777 on first leg to KL then A380 to CDG and back then A330 from KL to Mel. 777 is spacious. Business class was pretty busy but economy was so quiet - this leg was a week after MH17. A380 is superb - I was in the front section on the upper deck both ways and it was so quiet. A330 is cramped and uncomfortable to sleep. IFE not the best and I am glad I flew in different months as the movies weren't the best. Food was pretty average but service was as always really good. That's always been the standout feature of Malaysian and in the face of everything that has happened their staff are still the most helpful in the skies.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-28;I flew from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur then to Paris. All nice flights saved up for business class which was nice too. The staff were good. Food and entertainment were good. The seat was excellent. All in all a good flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-20;Flew FRA-MNL-FRA. First leg delayed (3 hrs) because they had to change an tyre. The seats are a bit hard and overused on the 777 but I choose them because of the 34 inch seats and legroom. The food was ok and the cabin crew very professional. Flight to and from MNL was in a new 737/800 and everything was ok. Flight back to FRA was on time food and crew ok. It is now the 5th consecutive year that I have taken MAS. In future I will still choose MAS because of their service legroom good prices and the short stop in KUL.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-14;KUL-TPE-KUL outbound on 1st Aug 2014 and inbound on 5 Aug 2014. B737-800 were being used for both sectors seat pitch was OK IFE was excellent food and beverages were great and the crew members were attentive and serve to perfection. Thumbs up for MAS!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-14;MH 795 Aug 4th HKT-KUL 25F MH 135 Aug 5th KUL-BNE 37F MH 134 Aug 6th BNE-KUL 37F MH 786 Aug 7th KUL- HKT 11A. Positives: Good IFE. Expected on long-haul above par for regional flights. B738 and A333 both less than 2y old. On-time dep and arr. Food for Economy ok. Price USD 350 less than SIA and even better than most LCC. Good value for money. Negatives: KUL-BNE flight freezing cold cabin. Apprx 70% of passengers were shivering wearing blankets and jackets. Asked to pls increase temperature. Nothing happened. One particular staff member argumentative patronizing and confrontational. Took forever to get to speak to Cabin Manager but once he intervened issue was sorted out amicably. Nevertheless caught a cold since this was 4hrs after initially addressing the issue. On MH 135 AirShow not working window shades pulled down and no announcements made from cockpit. In light of recent events I find it rather insensitive of MAS not to understand the need to keep passengers informed. Upon request the clearly annoyed First Officer announced we were just passing Alice Springs. Cockpit crew really should communicate more with the cabin especially if AirShow is INOP.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-14;Flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. Unfortunately we experienced a delay while already in the plane because of high traffic at HK airport. The FA's immediately started distributing drinks and peanuts. The flight overall was a pleasant one with friendly and pro-active service and good food. I'm not a big fan of the 737-800 though. The older 777's that they also operate on this route are in my view much more comfortable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-11;We all know this airline has had unfortunate problems however this does not excuse the tardy service well was it even service on two sectors London to Kuala Lumpur and Kuala Lumpur to Auckland in July. For a 5 star airline both my wife and I were very disappointed. We flew the day after the Ukraine disaster the cabin crew on both legs looked for want of a better word 'tired'. We were served very quickly on the London - KL leg the cabin shut down and then left to our own devices. There was not a crew member to be found a couple of times that I wandered back to the galley. In fact there was not even any water or juice left out for us to help ourselves to nor was there as with Cathay on our trip over a cabin attendant roughly every hour bringing water juice and snacks around. The same happened on the KL Auckland flight. I also found the inflight entertainment disappointing especially on the second leg where the screen was not performing well nor would either my wife's or my hand piece retract into the seat arm. If this is 5 star service then it must only be in the front of the aircraft or did we have an unfortunate couple of flights? I hope the latter!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-11;MH is superb in the skies and lousy on the ground. SYD-KL-DEL. Excellent FAs and service. Planes neat and tidy. On the ground its a sad story. City offices in Delhi and Sydney seem to consider customers an unwelcome sight and an insufferable burden. Phone calls go unanswered and the ticketing agent in Sydney had a zonked look on her face and hustled me along. There are others waiting. Rude reservations staff in Sydney. in Delhi the doorman answered the phone after a good 2 minute wait to tell me everyone was out at lunch and I should call later. The call made later were never answered. The next day an over enthusiastic officer who seemed to have been high on something returned my call and was raring to go. I will definitely fly MH and ask my friends to support the airline in these trying times but MH need to get their act together landside.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-08;Several regional sectors SIN-KUL-DPS-KUL-SIN KUL-SGN-KUL in Economy as well as KUL-BKK in Business July 2014 on their 737 and 777. All flights full all flights on time and all flights from pleasant to excellent. MH offered two choices of hot meals with beverages on all flights (more options in Business) the food always tasty their cabin service good to excellent and the aircraft in good condition. The 777's are clearly showing their age with dated IFE but the 34-inch seat pitch is wonderful compared to the cramped 737's. Moreover the generous 30 kg baggage allowance was one good reason for booking MH long haul as well as regional flights. Great value and good service all the way - will surely book MH in the future as well.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-06;Flew 787-800 - Colombo to Kuala Lumpur - Return. Good airline with courteous staff. Flight was fine. I found the seats to be surprisingly uncomfortable which is unusual as I am normally happy sitting anywhere. Not a massive problem though as I dropped off to sleep anyway. The 787-800 is a great little aircraft so no problems there. MAS use it regularly around Asia on short haul flights. Great little workhorse. Would I say they were 5 star? Based on just on this trip no however I would need to fly long haul to have a better opinion. I would recommend them and would fly again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-06;Flew LHR to KUL and on to BKK. LHR leg on MH3. A wonderful flight on spacious A380 upper deck forward section plenty of open space around seats rather than pod like structures. Toilet was the only airline toilet I can comfortably fit in. Staff attentive and Captain announced there were 2 flight crews. Flight fully booked and they were offering economy passengers €600 to travel on the later flight that day interconnects taken care of and a day hotel too. A great bargain. The check in desk told me the flight is always full. Lounge not wonderful though. Food just ok but cramped when carrying hand baggage and seats that do not move. Poor uk newspaper selection and none on the plane. Aircraft certainly recommended. Food on flight and wines really good. The entertainment system had a great screen but quirky interface. If you want in flight info you have to use a mouse cursor hard to see and imprecise whereas all other screens do not. The movies were not as up to date as some airlines but certainly plenty of choice and adequate. My wife's screen hung a couple of times but later reverted to where it left off. The staff were superb. Change at KUL was a shuttle train away and somewhat complex with plenty of walking and having been given no information on the plane you were left to your own devices looking for info screens the first a distance from getting off and with only an hour between flights the luggage did not make it to BKK. An hour was a bare minimum gap between flights for me let alone my luggage. There were no complications such as going through security beyond a hand baggage X-ray at the gate. I guess unloading a plane the size of an A380 takes longer and priority luggage seemed not to help its passage. However a Thai air rep approached us as at the baggage carousel in BKK so we did not have to wait until the last bag came off. We were told the luggage would follow 4 hours later and it was efficiently delivered to our hotel that evening fully wrapped and sealed. The hotel knew the process so presumably commonplace. By comparison the leg to BKK felt dated and so small and we had another breakfast. This time the toilet was so small I did not even attempt it. All in all despite the snags detailed I recommend Malaysia and especially the A380. It is very quiet spacious and felt new (which of course it is).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-06;Flew BNE-KL-BOM. A330 from BNE-KL - fairly empty flight. Staff were a little older very pleasant. So much food. Seats were comfortable enough. It was a late PM flight so I was keen to sleep. I couldn't get comfortable on the lie flat bed - I felt like I was slipping down. I managed a few hours and then got woken up for a really early breakfast (again lots of food). Plane was new and fresh. It was an old plane between KL/Mumbai - and delayed due to an electronics issue. It was like a domestic business seat. Not much space! From Mumbai - KL it was a 777-200 - much better with much more space! KL-BNE was A330 again. Pretty much the same experience except it was a daytime flight so ZERO chance of any sleep. Again food was good and abundant. Won't fly them again despite my good experience. I was pretty uptight on the flight home - watching us move past all the volcanic ash by flying right down the west coast of Australia (safety first).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-06;"Jakarta-KL-Guangzhou on 22/07/2014 went smoothly. Cabin food and staff were good average. On the way back we flew from Hong Kong to KL morning flight at 8.45am. It was on time. Entered the cabin and was met by a very sullen tired and bored looking stewardess. Cabin looked filthy. Pillows were scattered on my seat and on the floor. Table had some sort of dried stain. The seat cover in front of us was dirty. Nothing babywipes couldn't wipe clean so why didn't whoever was in charge of cleaning the cabin do so? A child tried to go to toilet while a stewardess was distributing food. Blocked by her cart the boy waited for her to move. Immediately she barked ""Where do you want to go?"" The boy looked surprised and pointed at the toilet behind her. She then moved the cart to the side a bit with a terribly bored look on her face and signed for the boy to squeeze through. Not even a smile or the kindness and patience expected from FA. From KL we flew connecting flight to Jakarta. Aircraft looked old and tired. No IFE at all. We had IFE on the flight from Jakarta to KL two weeks before but not today. It was a 1 hour and 45 mins flight with nothing to do but eat and sleep. Needless to say in the future I will try my best to avoid this airline. The cheaper price doesn't justify their bad attitude.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-06;Flown from Singapore to Frankfurt with stop over in KL on July 20th. The flight was the most uncomfortable I have had for a long haul flight. The crews were not the happiest the plane was old with the smallest screen I have seen with a small selection of movies. The seat was uncomfortable run down toilets and dirty. I don't think I will fly MH again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;Let me say that passengers who don't have infants and toddlers should not have these problems. We (my wife my 2yr old son and my 6 month old daughter) travelled to Asia from Australia. Everything went fairly well on our way from Australia to Malaysia. We were allowed 3 pieces of hand luggage and 4 pieces of main luggage. Almost all of our hand luggage was full of essential items. When we land in Malaysia for the transit and are about to board the connecting flight we were told that we cannot take 3 pieces of hand luggage onboard as its a smaller flight. We had paid for 3 seats and a bassinet. However after arguing with the ground staff for 10 minutes they still would not let us take the last hand luggage in with us. When we got onboard the flight wasn't full. To add to the misery they had allocated seats for us in completely different places leaving my 2 year old by himself my wife in a completely different section by herself and me with my 6 month old in another section! When I complained to the on-board crew they said that they were unable to help and that I'd have to speak to the passengers of the area where I wished to be seated and swap seats with them. Our return flight wasn't the best either. No bassinet for the complete journey although we had fully paid and confirmed a month ahead of our journey. The excuse was that there were 9 infants on board and only 5 bassinets. My poor wife had to hold our 6 month old for over 12 hours in a cramped seat! At one point my 2 year old was getting unsettled so I asked one of the stewardesses if they have any toys or kids activity books to keep my son occupied/entertained. She disappeared for about 15 minutes and came back with 4 packets of peanuts! Never again will I fly Malaysia Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;Flew with MAS from LHR to SYD and back. First on A380 which was cosy then on B747 which was old and dated. Seats were uncomfortable and staff were really rude. Nothing compared to SQ. Food was woeful and not enough cabin staff to serve. Won't fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;Perth - Kuala Lumpur - Beijong return June 28 flew back July 12. Last minute upgrades to business class (Maximum 2 hours before flight you can book for most flights if they have seats) at a 66% discount was well worth the money. My champagne glass was never empty Head stewardess personally greeted me by name at the start of the flight and thanked me for flying with Malaysia Airlines just before landing. Was asked whether I wanted to be woken for breakfast which I appreciated. Meals and entertainment was first Class. Could not sleep well on the angled flat seats but others slept fine. 22 hour layover in KL on way out and 8 hours on way in. Airport Hotel for both layovers were given without having to ask.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;KTM-KUL-MNL return. The cost cutting is evident and so is the total lack of service from the FA's. The 737-800 operated in all the sectors were fine so was the IFE. As soon as the sub standard meals were served the lights dimmed and the crew disappeared happy to chat and laugh out loud amongst themselves. For a 4 hrs 30 mins flight after the first hour I did not notice any crew before the captain announced it was time for touchdown. This appalling service is simply not acceptable.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;KUL-ICN-KUL A330 economy. Overall satisfied. Most of the crews were helpful and professional yet it seems like some crews need further improvement. In flight meals were quite good on both flights. IFE system was better than I expected. There was a wide range of music and movies. Comfortable seat with decent leg room for medium-haul flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-08-03;3/7/2014 MH 134. 4/7/2014 MH 072. 14/7/2014 MH 433. 15/7/2014 MH 135. The food on the flight from Brisbane to KL was very disappointing also the drink selection was very limited on all legs of our trip to Hong Kong. Overall the experience was fair.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-31;Flew SYD-KUL-SYD. We have flown MH a few times over the years. Sadly service levels have declined. The disposable covers on the pillows looked like they haven't been changed in months. They are meant to be white but were actually yellow. My daughters tray was dirty and all staff could say was 'that's not our issue that's a cleaning issue so just complain when you get there'! Food was very average on both flights and much less food served than normal. My kids were very hungry. I do not recommend ordering children's meals. IFE was OK but could improve. Faulty headphones both flights. Seat did not recline on SYD/KUL flight. There were less cabin crew than usual and they were not very attentive. Definitely not on par with SQ or CX anymore. Only good thing were the seats which made for a comfortable flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-31;BKK (Bangkok)2 to SYD (Sydney) via KUL (Kuala Lumpur). Travelled on a whim as the flights were so cheap. Used to travel on MH a lot 20 years ago and they used to be excellent. BKK to KUL on 737 had surly staff a tiny croissant and no coffee. IFE guide featured latest Hollywood releases but the system only had Bollywood movies. Seat was OK. Flight on time. KUL to SYD on A330 was only 30% capacity yet the service was still very slow and not very friendly. No drink rounds were offered. Food was reasonable but on the small side. Seat had plenty of room and many customers had 4 seats to lie on. SYD to KUL 100% full A330. Service was as good as the earlier virtually empty flight. Staff looked harried as if they had to meet a deadline yet they were so slow One flight attendant looked as if she were about to cry. Food again reasonable. KUL to BKK on 737. Faster service and friendly staff. With very good fares and a 30kg baggage allowance I will fly MH again But they fall short on this run compared to Qantas or Emirates.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-31;SIN-KUL-NARITA (MH 610 MH 88). NARITA-KUL-SIN (MH 89 MH 607). I travelled solo for this return trip on 16 July and 26 July. Boarding was organized and smooth. Throughout my flights the cabin maintained cool conditions smelt great and it also helped that the seats were comfortable which allowed me to catch needful sleep especially on my red-eye flight in MH 88. I must commend the cabin crew on my flights as they were nothing less than professional and friendly ensuring I got what I wanted although I noticed that one had to ask for beverages and they don't do rounds along the aisle to check on passengers during off-service times. The food wasn't the best I have tasted inflight but that was fine with me - had the Nasi Lemak on MH 88 and seafood pasta on MH 89. I wouldn't hesitate to travel on Malaysia Airlines again!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-25;I flew them in June. Unfortunately my travel experience was really bad. I say this mostly as the staff were unfriendly unapproachable and disdainful. The food/entertainment/seat etc were all pretty standard although I thought it might be better than average. The rudeness of the flight attendants was sadly on each of the 4 flights I took - Melbourne-KL-Manila and return. I asked for water and eyes were rolled I told them about the headphones not working and the lady argued with me. All staff appeared tired flustered and not happy to be there.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-25;"LHR-KUL-Bali and return. Part on A380. My husband and I fly long haul regularly with close family living in Australia. This is the first time we have flown Malaysian and sadly will be the last. I was led to believe they were a good quality airline however the only positive I can say is the comfort of the seat with the fact they have a 34"" pitch. Everything else was either satisfactory or poor. The food compared to other airlines was awful and the service wasn't much better. There didn't appear to be enough cabin crew to do what they needed so when I dared to ask for another blanket because I'd spilt water on mine the stewardess was extremely rude to me stating she was too busy and I'd have to wait. When she did bring over she threw it at me and walked off! I don't expect to be treated like that when I had been nothing other than polite. It wasn't as if we had used the call button for anything else.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-25;KL to Chennai. Paris Malaysia air staff had effectively through booked us from KL to Chennai. Very smooth transit and luggage transferred for us. KL to Chennai and return economy class. Very efficient service. Food average. Just OK. IFE didn't work on return trip. Happy enough with flight at the price.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-25;Flew Malaysian back from Bali to KL and then KL to London. Both flights good. Ground crew friendly. Food very good and air crew excellent apart from one rather surly chap who obviously thought my asking for my mid flight snack was a huge inconvenience for him! Both flights choc full despite all of the recent events. Seats terribly uncomfortable on the A380 and IFE too limited for an airline of this standard.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;Flew economy from Auckland to KL and then onto London on 20 June returned on 9/10 July. The 777-200s on the AKL to KL leg are in poor condition. Seat covers were worn carpets dirty and stained tray was cracked and the LCD monitors had a poor picture quality. Cabin staff were quite terse with passengers and a few did not have a good command of English. I asked for a dark rum and coke. The stewardess started pouring a bacardi and lemonade. Advised her twice it was the wrong drink but she ignored me. Passenger next to me asked for a can of lager and had to repeat himself three times before I pointed to a can of beer. Food was barely edible with undercooked chicken and stale rolls. KL to LHR leg on the new A380's was better. Planes are new and staff made an effort to be friendly. food was OK but only 3 drinks offered on a 13 hour flight. passengers were constantly asking cabin crew for water to stop dehydration. Check in staff at AKL was rather chaotic and some leadership is required to deal with passengers with excess luggage who were constantly holding up the queue. Disappointed that passengers relatives were wandering in and out of supposedly off limits check in area. Check in staff at London were terse and did not greet me with a hello or thank you. Only positives were cheap fares and planes all left on time. Sad to see a once top airline declining so badly.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;We flew ADL-KUL-IST then CDG-KUL-ADL and we found MH to be very good. All flights were on time and the staff were very attentive coming around with drinks virtually every hour. The food served was quite good although the infamous MH chicken or mushroom roll was served on 2 legs and was just average. The aircraft's were all clean and modern so really no complaints at all.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;PER-KUL-AMS. Another great flight on Malaysian. Service great food good so glad they now give you mattresses for a better sleep. Only complaint - the IFE needs to be improved but who really remembers what they have watched.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;Flew CGK-KUL vv. Quite disappointed with MH meals nowadays. In CGK-KUL crew offered fish or chicken and I chose fish which taste so-so and it came with mori biscuit. No chocolate or a cup of water like they used to give. In KUL-CGK it was even worse only a cold tuna sandwich which tasted horrible and orange pudding. But IFE was good crew were attentive and cheerful and got sky interior on both sectors but I expected more for the meal.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;KUL-DPS 737. DPS-KUL 777. Very odd seat layout on the 777 2x5x2 which I've never seen before. Sandwiches looked revolting both ways didn't even unwrap them. Rudest stewardesses I've ever seen surly abrupt and when the people opposite me requested blankets they were practically thrown at them. I can only assume their long haul product is in a different league.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-17;KUL-DPS 737. DPS-KUL 777. Very odd seat layout on the 777 2x5x2 which I've never seen before. Sandwiches looked revolting both ways didn't even unwrap them.

I can only assume their long haul product is in a different league.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-13;Flew twice on the Auckland-Kuala Lumpur leg and vice versa a few weeks later on their Boeing 777. The trips were on-time and their cabin crew was very efficient. Food was excellent however the in-flight entertainment could use and upgrade to a newer model. Seat was fine 2-5-2 layout worked well. All in all I enjoyed the trip and I would use them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-10;A good flight from LHR to KL on the upper deck of an A380. Bit of a mix-up over a bottle of champagne my sister had bought from the airline for us as when it arrived it was in a sealed bag with some other passengers' names on it. Catering very good lots of drinks runs. In flight entertainment far too limited in choice for an airline with such a good reputation. Crew excellent. Seats no more comfortable than any other aircraft or airline despite my being led to believe the A380 is better.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-08;Flew Paris to KL on A380 business class July 6 2014. Wonderful flight. Check in smooth. Flight ultra smooth and quiet. First time I have ever had a good nights sleep on any plane. Enjoyed dinner and breakfast. Tasty fresh plentiful and interesting. Wine of very good quality and generous with top ups and further requests during the flight. Staff knew us by name friendly prompt and helpful. Entertainment system brilliant once you got the hang of operating it. Again staff were very helpful with this. Only gripe (and this was very minor I could have done with a wider choice of films to my taste but I suspect that most travellers would have been happy with the choice. The toilets were spotless and bigger than many in the apartment we had in Paris definitely the most spacious I have seen on a plane.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-06;SIN-KUL (737-800) and KUL-AKL (777-200). As a One World Sapphire card holder I was entitled to use the MH Lounges in SIN and KUL. Both were dated and featured a limited selection of refreshments. Similarly both aircraft cabins were tired and filthy - scuffed walls carpets littered with crumbs torn seat covers etc. IFE was ancient and featured only a limited selection of older movies. Two hot meals were served and to be fair they were decent for Economy. However the crew did not offer refreshments in between meals not even water. Indeed both sets of crew I encountered were distant sullen & at times downright rude. Prospective customers should be aware that MH is far from a 5 star airline these days. In fact I would rank it towards the lower end of 3 star carriers. Would only consider MH again if the airfare was exceptionally cheap.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-07-03;HEL-FRA-KUL-SIN on 27th July on E90 (code-share with Flybe Nordic) B777 and B738. All flights were perfectly on time and the cabin crew was absolutely outstanding on the FRA-KUL leg that was half-empty. The B777 was not the newest on the market but the generous 34-inch seat pitch as well as the outstanding service given by a very experienced MH cabin crew made the trip enjoyable. It was great to have a relaxed pre-lunch cocktail service just like in the old days a tasty hot lunch mid-flight sky snack as well as a full hot breakfast before landing at KUL with regular water rounds in the cabin during the night. MH still manages to give a five-star economy experience and we think it wasn't merely good luck. Keep up the great work!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-30;KUL to DPS and vice versa were operated by a B772. Although the C class felt outdated the seats and the entire cabin was impeccable. Crew were friendly and extremely polite. Lounge at KUL is spacious and peaceful. More can be done to improve the premium classes and it's offerings. Professional crew and hats off to the entire crew on this flight for continuously smiling. The quality of the catering on MH has gone down and a lot is left to be desired.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-20;Kuala Lumpur to Kota Kinabalu. The positive point is only punctual operation. I was disappointed with the business class product. I don't understand the concept of using old 738 with no IFE. What do you expect passengers will do with no IFE on a 2.5 hr flight. The seat was fairly uncomfortable. The biggest let down was the food the food served in business class was awful. Stewardess courteous but not attentive nor particular warm and friendly.;NEGATIVE

Entertainment system barely works if you can work out how to get it out of its case. Food is terrible. Nothing kids would eat no snack options like biscuits or cheese and crackers. Nothing I would eat! Why would you offer a curry at 7 in the morning on a flight to Melbourne full of Westerners. No alternative options were provided. We flew at night so everyone could sleep but they kept waking us turning lights on serving food pushing seats up when it's the middle of the night. Flight attendants nothing like on the ads that's for sure! Would never fly them again.;NEGATIVE

malaysia-airlines;2014-06-18;Flew from London to KL (A380) on 23rd May. Crew were excellent and friendly as usual. Good food and inflight movies. Overall a great experience. The flight cost was rather steep paid circa £900 for economy. You could fly cheaper via SIA or via Emirates - although MH was direct. I frequently use Malaysian airlines but have never been upgraded and I wonder if they should start doing so especially when the flights are not full.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-16;Kuala Lumpur to Brisbane. New Airbus A330-300. Check in was fast and flawless. Very good information about the flight status before boarding. Boarding was greeted well. Flight attendants looks slightly old but alert. Legroom was good. The multimedia interface was excellent with wide variety of shows and movies. Food was good and filling. Very quiet flight even with many people. I would recommend this airlines for an enjoyable flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-10;MEL-KUL on A330. The seat was hard and not very comfy to sit for a longer period. Poor selection on IFE service was decent and food was ok. Nothing really stands out just your average decent airlines. Something for sure that it is not up to the standard of a 5-star airline like others. the service food and IFE on MH is noticeably inferior compared to other legacy airlines i.e. Singapore and Cathay.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-10;KL- Hong Kong June 1 2014. Decent flight food fine service great inflight entertainment a big let down (movies and inflight mag).;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-02;Flew SYD-KUL-DEL-KUL-MEL. Like most of the reviews I found that the cabin crew had no customer service and all seemed to hate their jobs. That being said I found everything else great. The aircraft ( We had the A330 B737 and the B777 ) were great and all had personal entertainment screens. The entertainment on the international flights was excellent and on the Kuala Lumpur - Delhi flights there wasn't as big of a selection but still good. I found the food great and alcohol was complimentary on all flights. I would definitely fly MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-06-02;KL-Colombo MH 184 May 15. Colombo-KL MH 185 May 20. Business Class. Service was still top notch friendly and warm. However I can't really say the same for the food served. Not up to my expectations. The satay somehow tasted bland the sauce wasn't as good as before. Cutting costs?;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-28;Flew from KUL to LGK on last week first flight experience from KUL to LGK with MAS. The cabin was clean. The crew service was excellent always responded to guests' requests. I have no comment on the foods and beverages on the flight as my flight was less than an hour and only entitled to refreshments. But as for my previous experience with MAS the foods and beverages were moderately good. Boeing 737-800 with more leg room and reduced flight fatigues.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-26;"Flew Delhi - Kuala Lumpur - Narita on return flights and on all 4 flights the crew service did not disappoint me. They were always up to see what passengers needed encouraging refill of drinks whenever they were awake. On most flights they addressed me by name as Mr. xxxxx without even reading from the list! A small thing like remembering passenger names could really make a positive impression about them. Though there seems many negative comments about seating comfort of B777 it had huge seat pitch (more than 70 inches) and could recline almost flat. Not full flat but there was a slightly angled foot mattress placed behind the seat where it could be adjusted toward leg-rest so that passengers won't slide due to angled flat seat. However I had a problem with seats on newer A330s. They have narrower seat pitch and their angled flat seats are uncomfortable to be honest. It is best if made in ""2nd position"" as indicated in seat adjustment buttons where it gives deep reclined position but not angled flat. Also seat adjustment panels are located in 2 locations one towards aisle or window and can be easily found and the other one hidden inside armrest! The one inside arm rest could choose the positions and can be adjusted manually where as the other can only be adjusted to 3 positions. Ordered Chef-on- Call and was fine. Satay was great. At KL Golden Lounge one should try out local noodles from the noodle bar. They are good! I would score 10 for overall experience due to professional and welcoming service by cabin crew.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-25;HKG-DPS found promo tickets business class seats are same price as Cathay Pacific economy. Travelled with them for the first time. Boeing 737-800 from HKG to KL is cramped for Biz class (similar to other airline's Premium Economy) service and food was good. The Malaysian Satay on the plane is great. Boeing 777-200 from KL to DPS was okay for a 3 hours flight much more roomy than the 737. Lounge in KL is sub-par to other 5-Star airlines. Generally a good flight but don't feel they are a 5-star airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-23;Flew 19/5 and returned 22/5 Denpasar to KL. Flight out on a 777-200 the flight being on time was the highlight. Have to say the meal service was the worst I have experienced. Staff appeared confused and missed a few rows out completely. The meal was down sized to a hot meal only. Return on a 737-800 again on time and easier to use entertainment. The first drink serviced arrived and we were offered either a chicken or egg sandwich. This was the meal service for this full service airline. On asking if I could have a beer with that I was informed that this was a non alcohol flight.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-21;Have to agree with Geoffrey Carver about the Boeing 777 that MAS still use. These belong in the scrapyard with the seats not even meeting premium economy standards. How do Skytrax manage to maintain the 5-Star rating for the airline? Besides the cabin products looking old tired and often shabby the once fantastic cabin crew are now more often miserable and certainly not focussed on customer service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-21;KL to Beijing return A330 each way. Outbound flight only half full and being the redeye there were plenty of empty rows in the center so wife and kids slept nearly the whole way. I ended up wandering up to business only about a third full to chat with a friend I happily realised was aboard also and stayed about 4 hours and the crew were fine with that. Tasty meal kids pack and more than enough booze thank you. Inbound flight was 6am so very full yet tasty breakfast and OK coffee kids happy with the entertainment.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-20;KL to AKL and return. B777. Business class. I hate the 777 with a vengeance. It is uncomfortable incredibly noisy and frankly outdated. Storage is poor.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-20;A380 LHR to KL and return. Business class. Our first trip in the 380 and very impressive too. Spacious comfortable. Good standard of catering. Cabin crew pleasant and obliging. Better than 747 by some distance. No hesitation in recommending.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-17;My husband and myself flew DUB-LHR-KUL-AKL return in April / May. We had a lovely trip both ways with all flights on time. We were really impressed with the flight attendants as they did all they could to make our trip pleasant. We cannot understand some of the negative reviews as our experience of MAS was totally positive.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-17;Penang to Kuala Lumpur only a one hour flight and meal was very limited. The service was good though and the flight was quite punctual.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-17;Penang to Kuala Lumpur only a one hour flight and meal was very limited. The service was good though and the flight was quite punctual.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-16;SYD-KUL-LHR Business class. First leg on nearly new A330 was excellent. I like the angled lie flat seat I seem to be able to sleep well. Food (call the chef service) was excellent and the drinks kept flowing. KUL to LHR on the A380 lovely aircraft and plenty of crew but the seat is awful. I find it very difficult to find a comfortable sitting position. Food OK on this service nothing remarkable. The First Class lounge at KL is nothing special - despite the renovation. I had a long layover and was hoping to use a sleeping room but they were all occupied at 4am (some occupied by staff!) so ended up checking into the excellent airside hotel for a three hour sleep.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-13;KL- Dubai - KL on A330 business class. The seat cabin ambience and food served was of good standard. Entertainment choices pretty limited for medium haul flight but don't bother me much since I am not a movie person. Crews were attentive and friendly on both sectors. Overall it was good.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-12;Used Malaysia Airlines to fly from London to Australia. The flights were on time and the leg to Kuala Lumpur in the A380 was very comfortable. The food was very average and the service too. This Airline is stated in this website as a 5 star airline but I don't think is up to that standard. The service compared with other airlines I flew before was nothing special.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-11;Dehli-KL 5th May. It has been a couple of years since we flew with Malaysia and in the last 6 weeks have flown with them 4 times. On this flight I had to endure takeoff with the seat in front fully reclined. Second time this has happened and a word to crew members is met with a shrug. Food on all flights inedible. Like the other flights no alcohol on offer was coke orange juice or water. I asked for water and got juice. Attitude of FAs unacceptable. Although I live in Malaysia I will avoid this airline wherever possible.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-11;Flew from Melbourne - Jakarta. The ticket was cheap but service was poor no smile when serving food. We had our baby with us and wanted their help to heat up some milk but it took ages for the cabin crew to come when we pressed the call button.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-10;"My family and I flew 3 sectors MAN-LHR (BA) and LHR-KUL-DPS on 13th April on the A380. Booked through MAS. Firstly nearly missed the flight as the domestic flight from MAN-LHR had been brought forward by 2.5 hours MAS had failed to notify us by email post or phone. It was only because I insist on being early that we made the flight! On board MH3 first impressions of the A380 was of dirt and ingrained filth and unfriendly crew. The seatbacks were really grimy and gave the relatively new aircraft the impression of having never been cleaned. No menus or amenity kits. The toilets were average but not cleaned to a good standard. The meals were revolting. No salt and pepper. Coffee offered before meal started. The children's meals were just lasagne. No choice at all. No kids packs offered. Drinks were poured into thimble sized glasses and the white wine was warm and vinegary. Crew flung the meals out in a disinterested fashion. No drinks brought round in the flight at all. We had to keep asking the irritable crew who were sitting in the galley reading magazines with curtains pulled round for glasses of water. Seatbelt signs on permanently and pointlessly since it was smooth as could be in the cruise. We kept hearing ""Ladies and Gentlemen as we are experiencing turbulence hot drink service will be suspended"" What hot drink service was that then? I must have blinked. We flew MAS in 2005 they have plummeted in standards since then. This time I chose them because they were excellent before and paid £710 per person this time around. What a big disappointment.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-08;6 May 2014 MH 388 to Shanghai Pudong. What is going in with Malaysian airlines? Service seems to have taken a dive together with food quality. Revamped First class lounge in KL is worse than the noodle cafe outside. Removing the platinum lounge to make way for that not so good. Also what's with the entertainment onboard? Please change it around faster. Having the same TV and movies running for months is not cool. Been flying MAS for 10 years and platinum member for 3. So I have seen the decline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-07;We flew Malaysia Airlines from Kuala-Lumpur to Melbourne a few days ago and we were pleasantly surprised with the service they provided. The cabin crew were excellent. Constantly checking if you were OK. They all seemed very happy and cheerful. Inflight entertainment food etc are all basically the same in any airline but the crew can make the difference.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-06;Bangkok - Tawau v.v. via Kuala Lumpur. Their hard product for this route is not up to industrial standard very old 737-800 in all flight worn out interior black stains all over torn seat cushion not fully functioned toilet and no entertainment at all. However they are not bad in other product offering. The food although far from decent in portion are tasty. Seat pitch is reasonably good perfectly punctual. Every of their staff are terrific service with smile and tried to solve the problem caused by their ageing aircraft. They really show us what Malaysian Hospitality mean.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-05;Frankfurt - Kota Kinabalu via Kuala Lumpur and back (B777-200 for long haul flight B737-800 for domestic flight). What I appreciated most - apart from the on-time arrivals - was the rather generous legroom on the B777 (rarely found elsewhere nowadays). However otherwise I found Malaysia Airlines quite average. 3 of the 4 planes did not look as if they were just delivered from the factory the cabins had a slightly worn look. Likewise the cushion had probably not been in contact with detergent for several weeks. The (vegetarian) food was only mediocre beverages were not served between the meals (on a 11-12 hour flight). Water and soft drinks were available in the galley but if one has a window or center seat that is of limited use.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-05-03;April 2014. I was pleasantly surprised. Our flight PER - KL was good. It was delayed an hour in Perth and then we raced for our connecting flight to Paris only to find that flight had been delayed as well but the food was really nice and the service was with a smile. KL-Paris on the A380 top deck was a great experience. The Entertainment had a great variety and snacks were available all through the flight. Paris to KL we were seated on the top deck again and I don't think I would like to fly below after experiencing this as there are not many seats the food comes out quickly and best of all is cleared away quickly. Kids were happy as they could plug their laptops in very easily and I found the headphones comfortable. Hubby sat next to the window and I was quite jealous of the little locker he had there and the shelf to lean on. I cant complain about anything. KL-Perth - back on the A330 and we noticed the difference with space might not be much smaller but it certainly felt more cramped. First thing I noticed was how dirty it was looked like a previous passenger had spilt something down the seat opposite me on the aisle and it hadn't been cleaned the carpet was also very worn down the aisle and there were a few unsmiling hostesses and our buzzer didn't get answered however it was a smooth flight with a great landing into Perth which is known for its turbulence on landing. All in all we enjoyed every flight service was great especially on 3 of the flights and not a sausage roll in sight. I would fly them again if I could sit up top and the price was right but Singapore Airlines is still my preferred airline - they do beat Malaysia in all areas. On another note my daughter left her ipad in the pocket of her seat when we landed in Perth and it was handed in and we picked it up the next day - so relieved.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-28;Flew KUL-LHR and return. Clean sleek and simple. Flight was on time and I felt comfortable. For this trip I had also flown BA to Prague and it was such a disappointment. Only thing I would suggest to MAS is to upgrade its inflight meals.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-27;MH - 128 Melbourne to KL - New A330 Aircraft was very clean and new Inflight entertainment was very good staff were not very attentive at all. Chicken sausage roll I found to be excellent however everyone else in the travel group hated it! Breakfast dishes were both terrible. MH 791 - Phuket to KL - New 737-800 Flight was excellent Chicken Lasagne was one of the best I have eaten cabin crew were good. Best flight of the trip! MH - 149 KL to Melbourne - Old 777-200 (1997 to be exact) however the comfiest plane I have been on! Headrest had an excellent range of movement to create a nice pillow the IFE screen was old and hard to see but not needed as I slept the whole way.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-27;6 flights in total London-KL (A380 upper deck) return KL-Kuching return and KL-Langkawi return. The London-KL flight wasn't too bad cabin crew were efficient but the food didn't taste too great but edible. Inflight entertainment was quite good. The internal flights were only about an hour and actually the food served was better than the long haul flights. The flight from KL-London was delayed by 3 hours - I wouldn't have minded so much but the flight departed around 3am and all the passengers were tired and cranky including us. At KL the ground staff at the transfer desk were not at all sympathetic. They said that the delay was due to waiting for passengers from a flight from Perth and as there were so many people connecting to this flight they had to wait for them. They gave us some meal vouchers and I asked them if I could use them anywhere our departure sector they told me yes except for Harrods and another restaurant. We went to a 24hr cafe and they declined my voucher! On both the long haul flights there were babies crying throughout the flight which did not make the trip too pleasant. Overall i would fly Malaysia Airlines again as the price was not too bad for the product they provide however if I had the choice I would probably pay a bit extra to fly with Singapore Airlines as the level of service was a lot better.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-21;We recently flew from KL to Brisbane on MH134. We have flown Malaysian several times both in economy and in business. Overall quite happy with the experience. The food is good although the gluten free options available to my partner are very limited and need improvement. The chef on call service available to business and first class passengers finally seems to be up and running. The service from cabin staff is excellent and very attentive. One negative is the delayed departures from Kl. This was the second flight we have taken from Kl where the flight was significantly delayed.. Malaysian airlines need to improve on this. Also the inflight entertainment choices are only average. We will probably fly Malaysian again although it will depend on price comparison with other airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-16;Mumbai to Perth with a stopover at KUL. By far the worst experience I've had. The flight in Mumbai was delayed by over 2 hours due to late arrival of incoming flight. Finally staff started boarding and let passengers into the gates. However everyone was stopped from boarding and were kept waiting at the aerobridge for more than 1.5 hours! There was little explanation with some staff talking amongst themselves about a technical problem. No one was allowed back into the terminal to use the toilets. Had to run at KL with hardly 10 mins to catch the connecting flight. Their seats are by far the most uncomfortable business class seats I've seen. The angular seats leave you with a terrible back ache. Never again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-14;London Heathrow - Kuala Lumpur 12 April on MH 003. The Malaysian airlines first class is not as impressive in comparison to other first class A380's out there on the market. It lacked style and good cabin ambience. It felt like MAS simply had to put a first class in for the sake of it and didn't really think through the idea. I've thought that MAS was the leading carrier in south east asia and hope that it will redesign its first class cabin. It such a shame with an amazing aircraft like the A380 that the first class product is simply mediocre.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-13;Flew from Perth to Paris on Friday 11th April. A fantastic experience. Could not complain on a single element. The food in economy was plentiful and extremely tasty and well presented with a lovely drink service too. Snacks and refreshments offered during the 13 hour flight KL to Paris. In flight entertainment was adequate not the best I've had but certainly enough choice. Flew KL to Paris on a new A380. Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft 2) but I did have the bonus of the small upstairs economy cabin. All up highly recommend and a bargain for the price you pay!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-13;I have travelled frequently with MAS between London and KL for the past 4 years. Throughout this time I have also travelled the same route with Singapore Airlines but had generally chosen MAS as they fly direct. The general standard over the past 4 years on this flight has been consistently anything but pleasant. The standard of food is what you would generally expect in an economy cabin albeit served differently. The cabin staff are unwilling to serve anything alcoholic prior to departure I have tested this on every occasion I have flown. The seats fail to recline fully every time I point this out to the cabin staff ends with the same unsuccessful trial and error approach to rectification despite knowing that this is how they have been designed. On my last sojourn I wished to sit next to a colleague. The flight was fully booked but despite this the check in staff provided me with a boarding pass that was next to my colleague. Shortly after boarding another passenger approach with a boarding pass which had also been issued for the same seat. The flights are consistently delayed. My last 3 flights have been delayed by 3 10 and 2 hours consecutively. As MAS are the only carrier to fly direct from London to KL the cost of the flight is considerably more expensive more than flying with other airlines that are not able to fly direct. My last journey was the one that finally broke me in the future I will choose to fly via an indirect route as I can't tolerate the consistent level of service provided by MAS any longer.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-13;LHR-KUL return on A380. Checked in was fast and hassle free especially in Kuala Lumpur. Was very surprised at the service in Economy Class. I travelled long hauls about 10x a year with various airlines (mostly Etihad). Crew were very efficient serving meals within 40 minutes of take off in a full cabin! However surprised by lack of choice. Plastic cutlery which is not very premium like. Plenty of drinks and crew answers call very fast indeed. Despite a busy flight the lavatories were cleaned frequently. The most by any airlines I've flown with so far. The crew were hard working and professional smiling and they interacted well with passengers. Its the small details that makes this crew the best I've flown with. Some might not like it but at least doesn't feel robotic. TV screens were big and selection of movies were good enough. Headsets were ok. Definitely the highlight is the crew not even the A380 size could beat it. If only the prices were more affordable and the Frequent Flyer programme were better I'd be using this at least 3x a year!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-13;Flew A330-300 Brisbane to KL and then A380 KL to London return. Second trip in less than 12 months flying Malaysia and once again could not fault the cabin crew and level of service. Seats on A330 angled/flat but managed to get some sleep and A380 seat pretty much flat and ok comfort wise. Only real complaint is that less than 12 months could not believe how the standard of meals had dropped. Ordered via chef on call and worked out ok but most meals I just picked at as were terrible. Very disappointed as were restaurant standard on last flight 11 months ago.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-11;"LHR-KUL-BKK and return. MAS A380 is an excellent product whilst the seats are not individual 2-2-2 formation they are comfortable and great when travelling with a colleague/partner. Flight attendants very friendly service excellent chef-on-call meals worked fine and wasn't too bad for plane food. Seats comfortable for sitting/relaxing and sleeping. would recommend rows 78 or 9 on the upper deck for a more private cabin. KUL-BKK on a very new 737-800. Again all excellent. All flights bang on time in both departure and arrival. Before we booked the flight we done a lot of research and at GPB 1739 return this really is a great product for the price and really knocks the socks other airlines with there individual business class ""cabins"". MAS is circa £1000 cheaper and I can safely say i would have no hesitation in booking with them again. Great product for a great price.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-08;DPS-KUL B777 Economy class. Flight delayed 30 minutes and no information on the delay. Cabin interior looked very tired. Food was really awful and service was slow. Cabin crew looked unhappy and surly. Please avoid the airline unless the fare is extremely low.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-03;I flew Malaysia Airlines sub MasWings from LBU-SDK via BKI on 31st March 2014. Check in at LBU was longer than normal as the staff member couldn't seem to get my booking for my BKI-SDK flight and I had to give him my booking details. MH3938 from LBU-BKI left on time and landed early. MH3104 from BKI-SDK left and landed on time. My baggage was out under 10 mins. The only let down was we were given a pack of peanut and no IE. Drinks came with some options. Overall good job from me.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-04-02;MH711 March 8 2014. Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Jakarta recently. Flight was okay overall but it was not without its unpleasant moments. One of the lavatories at the back of the plane was out. As a result quite a large line formed after the food service. While I normally do not use the front lavatories as I know those are for Business or First class I assumed given the circumstances it was justified. What followed was a very ugly scene with the flight attendant who accused me of lying about the lavatory being out of order. We argued for quite some time as well as while she called to confirm. Only then would she let me use the restroom. I didn't appreciate being treated like a small child. I think it is highly unlikely that the lavatory broke mid-flight which means Malaysia Airlines undertook the flight knowing it was a toilet short of what it needed on a full flight.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-31;My wife and I travelled from Heathrow to Auckland and back with MA in business class. Firstly the food was excellent (my wife had a steak which she confirmed was better than any she had eaten in a New Zealand restaurant). Food and snacks just kept on coming! With the exception of the KL - Auck leg (777-200) the planes were in good condition and most comfortable. Unfortunately the 777-200 doesn't have fully flat beds and for us it was uncomfortable as one seemed to slip to the bottom of the seat as soon as one fell asleep (as mentioned by many others here). The A380 is great! We liked the lounge at KL and at Auckland although the Heathrow lounge is not quite as good. Massages were available in the lounge at KL but we felt they were a tad too expensive so didn't avail ourselves of the opportunity. I would definitely use MA again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-31;AMS-KUL-SIN and KUL-AMS. Really disappointed would sum up my feelings. It was my first experience of MH we usually fly SQ for our trips to the Far East. Dirty old looking plane that looked like it hadn't had a deep clean in years. Very old entertainment system which seemed to go faulty throughout the flight to the annoyance of passengers and indifference of crew. Outbound the crew seemed completely disinterested disappearing for hours after serving lunch much more friendly and professional crew on return trip but same stale hard product filthy toilets dirty worn out seats (arm rest came apart and seat would not remain upright). Food and beverages decidedly average with no choice on two of the four meals we had. Would only fly again as a very last resort.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-31;MH003 and 135 on 10th Feb. Returned 13th March on MH134 and MH004. Flight from Heathrow to Brisbane. Poor quality food. Staff reluctant to offer extra beverages especially on the outward leg from Heathrow to KL.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-30;Having completed 4 long haul flights I found MH to offer good value for money all flights operated on time the food and wine was of an acceptable standard the entertainment has greatly improved especially on the A380 they need to upgrade the B777 to the A380 level. Cabin crew were excellent. We travelled MH003/11 Feb LHR-KUL MH141/12 Feb KUL-SYD and MH130/16 Mar AKL-KUL MH004/18 Mar KUL-LHR. We took advantage of an upgrade offer on the AKL-KUL flight for a small fee We noted that the food service was poor for business class eg only 1 dessert choice and no cheese selection.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-27;My last flight with MH was October 2013 from Melbourne to Istanbul and back. Cabin crew were brilliant all done with a smile and the food was good. Would definitely travel with Malaysian again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-27;I flew with MAS sub MASWINGS from Sandakan to Labuan via Kota Kinabalu on 24 March 2014. My 1st flight MH 3094 was delayed and they put me on the next available flight MH 3037. I was able to catch my connecting flight on time. Both flights were on ATR 72.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-26;I travelled from LHR-PER stopped over in KL on my return. Travelled on A380 the seats food service and comfort were incredible. The inflight entertainment had a good variety of films. Cabin crew were courteous and friendly. I only have praise for Malaysia Airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-26;PER-KUL-AMS in January. The cabin crew were rude no smiles and not friendly at all. It was as though us passengers were a major inconvenience for them. Like so many negative reviews about Malaysian Airlines the seatbelt sign stayed on almost the entire flight despite smooth flying. Passengers were ignoring the seatbelt sign and would leave their seats and the cabin crew ignored it. We booked 2 seats together yet when we checked in we were separated for some unknown reason. The meal was awful. That was my last flight with Malaysian Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-25;My wife and I travelled on flight MH 120 to Kota Kinabalu ex Perth Western Australia 13th March 2014 and returned on March 23 2014 on MH 121. Both these flights did not serve tea or coffee with the excuse that there was a safety reason. The crew was nowhere to be seen when departing the aircraft in Perth (except for the captain who said goodbye). We have travelled all over Asia with a number of airlines and we have never had this type of service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-24;Flew SYD-KUL-SYD on the new A330. Way out cabin crew were fairly disinterested and it was difficult to get their attention but on the way back some of the best service I have had I didn't need to ask for anything. Seats were quite spacious and fairly comfortable. Good choice of films on IFE. As others have said the chicken pastry is awful. Would overall recommend.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-21;DPS-KUL return. Outbound on a 737 - even though it's only a 3.5 hour flight it's unusual for major airlines not to have individual IFE (even Qantas has it on DRW-SYD!). Return on a 777 that was much more pleasant - in fact just having 9-across on a 777 is a reason to choose Malaysian (or Singapore) over someone like Emirates and their cattle trucks. Otherwise it's the Malaysian I remember from a few years ago - reasonable service facilities and organisation. Food has really gone downhill - one of the meals tasted good while the other seemed uncooked but both were very small and simple.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-19;SYD-KUL-HYD and return in economy. Compared to the competition the level of service was not up to the mark. General attitude of staff was not friendly. Though both the aircraft's were pretty new the quality of service only meant that the overall value was still lacklustre. Food was OK and the choices were very limited. Staff tended to be between neutral to rude. I stood up to stretch my legs on the flight when the seatbelt sign was off and was told by a crew member in a 'commanding tone' to go back to my seat and sit down. It took at least 5 presses on the flight attendant button and 15 mins of waiting for them to serve a glass of water.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-17;We flew to KL from Adelaide on an A330 - nice and clean. Seats not very comfortable though - inseat entertainment very good. Service was fantastic - never had to ask for anything. Meals were a bit pathetic for a nearly 8 hour flight. Please get rid of those awful cardboard like chicken/veg rolls they are disgusting and not the sort of thing I really felt like for breakfast. Overall a good experience better that Qantas but nowhere near the standard of Air New Zealand.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-13;KUL-SBW-KUL B737-800. I flew last few month with MAS the service was excellent. The cabin crew were nice and the domestic flight had inflight entertainment. The inflight meal where I had a special request was ok but still a lot of room to improve. I will fly with MAS again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-12;Flew economy class on an A330-300 from Kuala Lumpur to Perth. The aeroplane was very clean staff were very good and friendly the seats in economy class was quite comfortable but they should give more space. The toilet was very small. The meals provided was in few choices and good. The inflight entertainment was good too there was a lot of movies music shows and dramas. Overall it was good.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-10;Flight between SYD-KUL-SYD were on new A330-300s. Excellent service food was great on both sectors. My only negative comments are about seats. They were the worst seats I have sat in as for sleeping just forget it. The A330 business class seat is a disgrace on MH I found it extremely uncomfortable never again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-10;Flew with family to New Zealand from Heathrow into Kuala Lumpur and then onto Auckland. Return journey was Auckland to Kuala Lumpur and then to Schipol. Flights were on time allowing ample time for making connecting flights. Staff were very friendly and helpful and worked tirelessly on these long haul flights As with a lot of airlines economy class seating is not the most comfortable but you get what you pay for. The food was very good and the vegetarian option which I had was varied throughout the journeys. Couldn't fault the inflight entertainment which provided excellent selections of current movies and old favourite TV programmes. All in all a very pleasant experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-06;Flew to KL from London on 19th Feb 14 on A380. Collapsed when stood up too quickly hitting my head hard on the ground (I've flow hundreds of times and this was a first so beware sitting for many hours then standing up too fast). Crew were outstanding finding a row of seats for me to lie down on. providing an ice pack for the bruising and regular checks to make sure I was ok. Even moved us to the front of the plane for a fast exit. Well done MAS - faultless service.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-04;Flew business class on an A330 from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur. I just have to say the aeroplane was very clean staff were very good my only negative comments are about seats. They were the worst seats I have sat in as for sleeping forget it. The toilet was very small and by the way this flight was not cheap. I would never fly with this airline in business class again. Economy short flights yes.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-04;KUL-DXB-KUL. Airport check in staff were good check in was quick. Flight en route to DXB was 30 mins delayed but arrived on time. Flight back to KUL was on time and arrived 30 minutes early. Outbound stewardesses did not smile at all and did not showing much interest in customer and comfort - disorganized team. Otherwise return flight FA's were attentive. Food for lunch was so-so and sandwich was awful. IFE was good and functioned well. All in all sad to say nothing special about MH and it was average.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-04;I am a frequent flyer. Having flown 6 sectors with Malaysian over Christmas and New Year I have enough experience to make a judgement. The cabin crew are generally inefficient and disinterested. The food is mediocre (breakfast during an 8 hour flight consists of a soggy chicken pasty and no hot drinks). Despite relatively calm flights on all 6 sectors I was offered tea just once due to the seatbelt signs being illuminated for most of the flights on all 6 sectors (which the majority of passengers ignored but the cabin crew ignored their non compliance). No safety demonstration given on 2 flights. They failed to honour a bulk-head seat reservation that they charged me extra for due to a change of aircraft and instead gave it to someone else.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-03;Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Seoul (MH 0066) on 15 Feb 2014 and Seoul to Kuala Lumpur (MH 0067). MH 0066 flight was delayed 3 hours because of a problem with the cargo we were sat on the plane waiting. MH0067 - The cabin crew were not very interested or friendly during service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-03-03;"MH148 MH1. MEL-KUL-LHR 5 Feb. Flight crew and aircraft excellent. Some of the complaints on here are truly childish. Things like ""cabin was filthy"" ""no chicken curry"" ""no window seat"" you arrived safely in comfort that's the important thing folks. Complaints about cabin crew maybe reflects your attitude to them and the way you treat them.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-28;Flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. My first flight with this carrier was very positive. The entertainment system was great for a four hour flight and the food was very delicious. Looking forward to flying with Malaysia again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-28;I have flown hundreds of time on various airlines and have never felt the inclination to leave a bad review until now. We flew from Melbourne to Hanoi with Malaysia just a few days ago and it was an experience not to be savoured. The staff were very unhelpful when I asked if there were any rows of seats available after take off I was promptly told that by the flight attendant that she didn't know and that I should walk to the rear of the plane and check for myself this was despite the fact she had just walked the aisle several times prior. Generally the staff were very unfriendly and unhelpful. Then the food arrived it was the worst dinner I have seen on a plane - needless to say we skipped dinner. All in all I would not fly with this airline again as I know what great service can be found on others like Emirates Etihad or Qatar.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-28;4 flights on MH in Business Class. MH 726 Jakarta to KL: The 2 female flight attendants serving were friendly and managed to address passengers by name. Although upon boarding neither were smiling. and indeed they look most unhappy. The forward toilet was dirty. I was also surprised that my cutlery had not been properly cleaned. The issue of MH's Nasi Lemak has received a lot of media coverage and yet the product on the flight from Jakarta to KL was not complete - it was only rice with prawns in a sauce with an egg. MH 129 KL to Melbourne: Boarding was efficient crew friendly and generally service was good. However the purser did not seem to do anything except look unhappy and did not interact with more than a couple of passengers. Surprised to be told that champagne could not be served while the aircraft was on the ground! The selection of newspapers and magazines needs to be less myopic. Similarly a better selection of world business and general interest magazines would be appreciated. MH 146 Melbourne to KL: Flight was much less enjoyable and probably only saved by the efforts of the female flight attendant in business class who made up for the poor service from the two other males and flight service director. She was the only person who addressed me by name. No menus available. The two male flight attendants went about their jobs with the minimum of interaction with customers service was very off-hand. The chef-on-call dish of beef was very tough. Most times when I went to use the toilets at the rear of the business class cabin they were occupied. As there were only 10 passengers in business class and they were all in their seats it suggests that the flight attendants allowed economy passengers to use the business class toilets. MH 723 KL to Jakarta: Not much to complain about although the flight attendant did not address passengers by name.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-27;SYD-PEN-SYD (via KUL) in Economy. SYD-KUL-SYD on new A330-300s. Check-in at SYD was fast and the agent was really friendly. Fast-track through immigration and security provided because of elite status. Priority boarding for status passengers honoured. Seated in bulkhead rows on both flights where legroom was plentiful. Onboard catering was reasonable and of a decent portion but nothing outstanding. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with the exception of one particular female attendant on the SYD-KUL leg who was a bit abrupt with other passengers. IFE was AVOD with a reasonable selection of movies and TV shows. Seat itself was much more comfortable than I was expecting and recline was also quite generous which made it comfortable enough to get a decent amount of sleep on the overnight flight back home. Both flights on time. KUL-PEN-KUL was on very old B737-400s. These planes will thankfully be gone by the end of this year. Priority boarding on the domestic flights for status passengers honoured. Both flights slightly delayed. Peanuts and juice offered on these flights. Cabin crew for these flights were friendly helpful and enthusiastic. Overall I was very satisfied with my experience on all flights and for the price paid it was great value for money.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-27;KL to Brisbane on MH135 on A330. Check-in was efficient and the flight left on time. During the 8 hour flight we only had one meal. It was announced that there was a choice of fish pasta or chicken curry. My wife and I were both looking forward to the chicken curry. When the trolley arrived the hostess told us that they had run out of chicken curry. When she saw the disappointed look on our faces she told us it was the pasta or we go without. We both chose the pasta which turned out to be bland and awful. The cabin crew just couldn't be bothered serving passengers. We barely saw them during the entire 8 hour flight. The entertainment was average. Also I had never been on a flight where announcements were made so frequently. They were made twice in English and Malay. If you were trying to sleep or use the in-flight entertainment these constant announcements were annoying. I will not fly Malaysian Airlines again unless the price is extremely cheap.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-25;BKK-KUL-HKG 23rd and 24th Feb first flight on a 737-800. I've used MH a few times before and always enjoyed the flight check in quick they use the Thai lounge in BKK which is just ok. Boarding quick and on time departure the aircraft was clean and fairly new I must say it was very comfortable. Food was ok and cabin crew did a good job - very friendly. KUL-HKG checked in at KL Central I made a mistake with online booking date ticket desk managed to change the mistake quickly for a charge of about £20.00. MH KL lounge is fine with a decent selection of food although I always find it very busy. Flight operated on a 777-200 I had to accept the last seat 4E in the centre middle but it turned out to be fine! I like the seats on this aircraft find them very comfortable. I used the same aircraft the other year for a long haul from LAX to TPE crew on this flight were very friendly food was just ok I managed an hours sleep before landing on time.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-25;I flew Business class last Dec from KL to Perth (return) 3 Adults and 1 infant. I must say I was very disappointed with the service. Service was slow our food was extremely salty thus inedible. They did not give me the baby food that I had pre ordered. I am now having trouble with my seating arrangements and customer service has been very slow to rectify this problem.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-25;MH 171 KTM-KUL 21 Feb. The cabin crew were not very interested in service and completely disappeared after the meal was served. I could hear the chatter and laughs from the galley and also saw them using tablets in full view of the passengers. Unprofessional.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-24;SYD-LHR-SYD (via KUL) in Business Class. Flight between SYD and KUL were on new A330-300s and flights between KUL and LHR were on the A380s. All flights on time. Cabin crew on all flights were very friendly courteous and helpful without being robotic. Check-in at SYD very smooth and quick with a very friendly agent. Angled flat-bed seats on the A330-300 is behind industry standard but they were comfortable enough to allow sleep but storage space is severely limited. Flat-bed seats on the A380 are much more comfortable with a lot more storage space for personal items but still not an industry-leading product. Forward mini-cabin on A380 feels very private and quiet. On-board catering reasonably good on all flights with the satay being consistently top-notch. Check-in at LHR also quick with friendly agents. All seat requests honoured as well as Chef-on-call meal orders. A very good product overall let down only by the hard product on the A330-300 but it was excellent value for money. Taking everything into consideration Malaysia Airlines will usually be my first choice to Europe.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-22;MH002 SGN-KUL-LHR on 737-800 and on A380 for the London leg. Good service from Ho Chi Minh. Nice food and nice plane (I'm used to Ryanair's version of the 737-800). Disappointing service on the long-haul to London. Cabin attendants failed to clean up a full glass of red wine which was spilled all over the exit door in front (I was in 74A which is a window seat without another seat in front. Incidentally this seat isn't worth paying extra for unless you are over 6 foot tall - the tray table and console are poor). Passenger in 73 left wine on the flimsy tray table (he had similar bulk-head style tray-table as me) which then got propelled across cabin due to turbulence. Took several attempts to get steward to clean it up. Will be avoiding Malaysia Airlines in future.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-21;Leaving Frankfurt 19th Feb arriving 20th Feb. MH 5. I have just returned from New York via Frankfurt with 2 different airlines of which one was Malaysia. I really have to say that it now feels like a different airline. In short I feel that the cutting cost is obvious. I feel the spirit of the crew is not there.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-20;We flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur and back from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur and from there to Amsterdam on 18 Feb 2014. The flight Amsterdam - Kuala Lumpur had decent service and friendly staff. However the return journey from Denpasar to Kuala Lumpur was a disappointment. Staff were bland and ignored your wishes. Even worse was the journey between Kuala Lumpur and Amsterdam. The food was distributed quickly the lights did not work which meant we could not read our book. We had different expectations of this airline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-19;"KL - Langkawi - KL - Phuket. Three flights on average 1 hour each on my tour of the Far East. The first two flights were on an ageing 737-200 and the last on a newish 737-800. Was surprised that the airline was dry on all but the last flight. Old business class on the 737-200 - which was very tatty. The newish 737-800 was very comfortable. FAs on all flights were friendly and efficient. My wife ate the food on all flights and said it was ""okay"". The lounge at KL was very average and again no booze. MA was for the purpose we booked them - okay. Would only use them again if I had to.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-19;Flew KL to Melbourne late last Saturday night. Had been offered and received a Boarding Pass for this leg of the trip the previous day in Yangon. At that time I'd been asked if I wanted a window seat to which I'd replied that I did. When I got on the flight I found myself squashed in the middle of the row two people each side. The seat didn't recline and the in-flight entertainment didn't work for most of the journey. This was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on and definitely would not recommend Malaysia Airlines to anyone.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-18;Flew KL to Denpasar 9th Feb. Rude check in clerk altered our pre booked seating allocation separating my family of 4 - I had booked these seats 6 months in advance. Cabin crew equally unhelpful. They left the seat belt light on for the entire trip. When I approached the business class cabin crew to use the lavatory urgently I was told to go back to my economy seat and wait. For a supposed full service airline there is no service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-18;MEL-LHR via KL return. Very disappointed with the Biz class seats on the legs to and from Melbourne to KL. The seat only had 3 settings and it had to be the hardest seat I have sat on. The cabin was filthy. The food was very disappointing. Overall this Biz class was certainly not worth the money. They need to review the aircraft they use on MEL to KUL leg - this is substandard. On a positive note the A380 (KL to London) Biz seats were very comfortable and the staff very friendly!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-17;I flew business class from KUL to NRT. From the (just renovated) lounge to the service quality of the cabin crew I would say that the experience was average. The newly renovated lounge atmosphere was simply chaotic and noisy food variety on offer was very limited. Noodles from the noodle bar barely edible. Shower facilities was nothing to write about. The service delivery was just mediocre. There was no drink rounds after the meal service the cabin crew were busy chatting away in the galley. I was expecting more from the cabin crew. Food quality are at best economy standard. Fortunately the experience was saved by the comfortable seat and generous leg space of Boeing 777. I would not recommend anyone to fly MH unless the price is cheap.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-17;Flew KUL-MEL A330. First class lounge in KUL was terrible. Service OK but A La Cart breakfast horrible. Food on board was worse. Inedible 'spicy chicken' limp salad and cream cheese instead of proper cheese. Meal before landing was even worse. Undercooked pastry with unidentifiable mushroom filling. That was it. 3 bites and it was gone. MAS used to be an unbelievable product. Its Air Asia flatbeds or SQ or EK from now on.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-17;Excellent service food was great. New seating and aircraft for the MEL-KUL leg was great the way personal space is utilised is brilliant. The 777 aircraft on the KUL-FRA route was very tired and dated the fleet definitely needs retrofitting and IFE viewing quality on these aircraft is poor. Nonetheless service was great and would happily fly with MAS again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-13;Travelled economy class on MH003 11 Feb LHR-KUL seat 80H and MH141 12 Feb KUL-SYD seat 26C. Both flights the crew were very good the seat and entertainment selection is far superior on the A380. I would recommend this airline as they offer a good product and value for money. The areas they could improve is the quality of the food especially the inflight snack on the LHR-KUL sector.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-13;7th Jan. Late flight Brisbane to Paris via K/L. A great airline. Excellent service from beautifully groomed flight attendants. The vegetarian food was the best I have ever had on an airline. There was plenty of good service with drinks. Very helpful and gracious staff. Put up in a fabulous hotel in Kuala/L. in between flights.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-12;Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur return on A330-300 flight on time and flight attendants were helpful and friendly plane was clean and looked fairly new. Would not hesitate in recommending Malaysia Airlines for travel.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-10;Travelled A380 KL to HK. Seat 56C economy class. This flight appeared to be only a third full. I noticed some people changed seats to have a length to themselves. The cabin was clean and spacious. The flight crew all impeccable with presentation and attitude. Security was tight at KL which I'm not complaining about at all. Plenty of leg room and very comfortable. I have travelled on various other A380 aircraft from different carriers and I found Malaysia to be of the same standard in every aspect. Food was fine I quite enjoyed it and drinks were plentiful.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-10;Travel from Sydney-KL MH142 and KL-Sydney. Everything was just average the food being served was horrible! I will not consider using this airline in the future.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-10;Travelled economy class from KL to Melbourne (MH147) on 6 Jan 14. Service was below average. Food was awful. Toilets were dirty.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-07;19th Jan 2014 SYD to KL A330-300. Beautiful aircraft I was seated in 21E. Flight time was 21.55pm departure and timely. Cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. Food was acceptable and crew worked all night on flight attending to seat calls. IFE very good selection. We had quite a bit of turbulence and flight deck crew kept us in the loop. All in all very pleased with Malaysia Airlines. Will fly again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-03;Travelled A380 from LHR to KUL on 17/1 in 1st Class. Surprisingly although interior is less luxurious than SQ or EK but seat and ambience is cosy and inviting. Crew are as usually very attentive. Food is just average. Flight entertainment hardware system is not bad but need to improve on movies and TV programs list available particularly to those with interest in golf cars etc. none available. Perhaps need to provide wet towels more often as interior is too dry after long hours.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-02-03;My wife and I flew from Manila to Kuala Lumpur on January 30 2014. The check-in process is very antiquated. Long lines are not managed at all. Sure baggage allowance is generous. but in-flight service is atrocious. Food was terrible. Attitude of the staff was indifferent - they just did not care. We were glad when the flight was over.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-29;Took MH1 flight from LHR-KUL and had an aisle seat in the economy class on the upper deck. Management of the queue at the gate was done in an organized and orderly manner and the staff were more than helpful. Since it was economy I didn't expect much because honestly one can only get that much of comfort in an economy class. There was an empty seat beside me so that gave me a good extra space. The in-flight entertainment had a good variety of movies music podcasts and e-books and the meals were great. The cabin crew displayed genuine friendliness and professionalism. My request for a cup of water was also immediately attended to. Overall I'd say the whole flight experience was great.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-29;We travelled Business Class from Sydney to Sri Lanka via Kuala Lumpur and back. The trip going to Sri Lanka was good. However on the return flight on the Colombo-KL sector they ran out of main course options. There were only 12 adults in Business Class and yet this happened. This is poor form for a business class service proposition. On the KL - Sydney sector they ran out of the amenities packs - when I requested a pack the hostess informed me that for some reason they had only loaded 50% of the required packs. Again they also ran out of the brunch options! Despite this the journey was comfortable and the staff very professional and pleasant. The trick might be to pre order your meal? Not sure.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-28;Flew Melbourne to London return. Experience inferior to that 4 years ago. Paid extra for seat choice. Change of aircraft type meant chosen aisle seat became middle of 3. Service very impersonal. Would prefer quality food not quantity.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-28;LHR to KL on A380 in business class then KL to Melbourne in business class. 3 hour delay at Heathrow not sure why as nobody seemed to know. Onboard seats ok and service was fines with plenty food and drinks the bad point being on arrival at KL no cases appeared. I only hope our cases come back with us on the return journey.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-28;Flew Melbourne to London return. Experience inferior to that 4 years ago. Paid extra for seat choice. Change of aircraft type meant chosen aisle seat became middle of 3. Service very impersonal. Would prefer quality food not quantity.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-28;Flew business class January 2014 it was a special price. We usually fly Qantas or Singapore. No comparison in terms of inflight entertainment and seat comfort I found the staff of Malaysian hit and mostly miss. On our KL To Mumbai the staff were so disinterested it was almost amusing. I rarely eat the food my companions commented it was reasonable and all agreed. Inflight entertainment outdated and seat recline was good flat position was uncomfortable if you can get the special price it's worth it otherwise I would not be happy paying full price for this level of service. On time was always good. Flew Sydney to KL then KL to Mumbai Colombo to KL then KL to Sydney.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-25;MH767 SGN-KUL and MH020 KUL-CDG. The flight to Kuala Lumpur on a 737-800 was about 1hr 50 mins and the level of food service was extremely lavish for the length of the flight - very impressive. Unlike many airlines like BA where seats in both classes have the same seat pitch and are 3 adjustable seats either side of the aisle their business class comprises a permanent 2x2 layout with extra legroom. The flight to CDG was on an A380 Superjumbo. It was the quietest smoothest flight I have ever experienced. The seat food service and comfort were incredible. I arrived after some sleep feeling fresh and ready for another day. Malaysia Airlines are at the top of their game - I made a good choice.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-23;London to Australia via KL and return journey. Food was bland and the crew surly and rushed. Have had much better service with other airlines. Thumbs down.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-20;Melbourne to Paris return in Business. First time in Business on Malaysia. Previous experiences with airline had been mixed. Overall their Business product doesn't have the polish of Emirates or Singapore but is a satisfactory alternative given the price. 777 MEL-KUL A380 KUL-CDG-KUL and then A330 KUL-MEL. 777 is aged but found it very comfortable (more so than the much newer A330). A380 was spacious and seat was good. A330 seemed more cramped than either 777 or A380 and lacked privacy. All flights had good service. Food varied from good to excellent and there was always plenty of it. IFE was a weak spot with not much of any interest to me. Lounges too were mediocre even in KLIA which surprised me being home base. However despite all this given that the cost of the ticket was substantially less than any other carrier and comparable to China Southern it represents good value and would happily fly them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-20;Flew business on A380 from KUL to LHR and return. Wasn't impressed with their business class offerings compared to EK Qantas or SQ. Comparable to the old biz class seats from their 777 and 747 which reclines at an angle. The saving grace for this airline is the exceptional crew. Genuine hospitality and very warm personnel. The highlight of this trip has be about how bad the food was. Was served satay which was excellent as usual but they now serve a menu done by Chef Zubir of Masterchef Malaysia. Huge disappointment. Beef ribs were inedible as it was tough changed to the cod which was surprisingly too sweet. Such a terrible experience for the price I paid and will certainly be avoiding MH in the future because the tremendous drop in quality.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-15;Flew business class Perth (Australia) to Paris (France) in Dec 2013 and back in Jan 2014. Terrible experience both ways. Malaysia Airlines delayed flights to London Frankfurt and Paris for a handful of passengers delayed arriving in from Jakarta/Singapore (the stories differed) and showed no care that hundreds were inconvenienced when they should have instead re-booked those few late passengers. No-one took responsibility to help with onward travel plans that were now destroyed. Meals not great (not enough food to ensure your choice was met). Movies poor choice. On return trip a wailing child in the small economy section behind business class meant I could not sleep. It wailed for at least 9 hours. I paid for business class for the supposed comfort and experience. Let me tell you it is not worth it. Even had a crew member tut at me when I wasn't immediately ready with my breakfast choice (never mind she appeared out of nowhere with no warning that they were collecting breakfast choices). Lounges very poor - terrible toilet facilities and food just not up to scratch. I am extremely disappointed.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-14;KL to Sydney in business class on a new A330 airbus. Cabin crew were very attentive great in flight service drinks plentiful and food very good. I have no issues at all with the seat comfort and size. I am over 6 feet tall and I find the seat adequate for my needs. I continue to be very impressed by what great value for money Malaysia deliver in business class. I will be flying with them again no hesitation!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-14;Adelaide to KL on a A330 airbus in business class. Another great flight! I have only praise for the fantastic experience I continue to enjoy when flying Malaysia airlines. The food in particular on this flight was of a very high standard and worthy of mention.;POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2014-01-13;MH17 Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur 3 January 2014 Business class on 777. Seat was outdated and uncomfortable. Cabin crew were not helpful and attentive. Catering was really bad and disappointing. Garlic bread was inedible and hard as a rock. Meals were ordered through Chef-on-Call but was given different meals. Cabin crew replied 'maybe they thought rice and potatoes were the same' when I asked about the meal. IFE was not updated and still showing last month movies and TV programs. Definitely not a 5-star airline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-13;Kuala Lumpur - Bangkok on Dec 30th. After reading the mixed reviews of this airline I was somewhat sceptical of flying with them. Old tatty Boeing plane from beginning of the 90's so worn out and tired cabin. Seats and tables were broken to the point where the entire seat row wouldn't recline. Food was actually inedible which is bizarre for a 5 star rated airline even air Asia can offer tasty dishes. First time on premium airline I had to return the food. FA's were efficient and courteous in service. There was absolutely no point in paying more flying with MH on this route. Will not be flying further with them.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-13;Return flight from KL-Langkawi. MH use very old B737-400 for this route the seats and interior looked very tired. It is not a 5 stars airline for sure Malindo aircraft is certainly beating MH. For an hour flight only peanuts and one round of drink was served. MH really need to replace their old B 737-400 to stay competitive.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-13;Travelled on MH1 LHR-KUL 3 Jan as part of an American Airlines ticket originating in West Palm Beach via Chicago and London. The seat comfort on the A380 lower deck is as spacious as it is on the upper deck. The wide seats and the legroom made the journey most pleasant. The meals were sumptuous and the service is beyond expectation. Crew were definitely top notch. I have never had a comfortable long haul flight in economy in over 20 years when legroom started shrinking.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-10;Kuala Lumpur to Perth in business. The KLIA lounge was really poor and thought the on board product would impress me. Obviously I was wrong no clear indication of priority boarding (so I queued for a long time before getting into the plane). Cabin was clean no doubt. However there was no personal storage compartment at all in this 'new business class seat'. Nowhere to put my ipad book headset etc. Asked the staff she said just put them on your seat? Seat was hard and didn't seem to support lumbar. Had to put a pillow under my neck to make it bearable. I tried so many configurations and I couldn't lie comfortably to sleep so I stayed up! I'm quite tall (179cm) and the angled lie flat seat was too short for me. I kept sliding down then hit the foot rest and exerted pressure on my legs. No amenity bags of any kind. Seat pitch was good but really tight seat width! Poor seat. In saying that the cabin crews were professional efficient and friendly. Satay was great. Though I didn't understand why did they put the dessert on the table even before main was served? Substandard IFE selection couldn't find anything to watch. I noticed they only had ONE kids movie! Really?! Its poor product cannot be fully complimented by their great cabin crews. MH really needs to think about their product offering to stay competitive. It was overall ok but not great or even good and Certainly not 5-star!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-09;Travel very frequently using domestic route KUL-BKI. I'm not a fan of airline food they are all bland especially when you are travelling domestic economy. But this particular trends get my attention. Back in 2011 the food was very good: 2 selections of Malaysian dishes (chicken or fish) with dessert (normally Kit Kat and fruit slices). Then in 2012-2013 the fruit slices were gone. My latest trip on 6-8 Jan 2014 we were given only the main dishes no dessert / appetizer. Looks like they are not even trying to improve the main dishes and lack of creativity. Not sure if this is the cost cutting measure they are trying to pull but it is not worth the money you are paying for full service carrier. And the cabin crew for domestic flight is OK (since there's no other FSC operating on that route). The Enrich miles program is good though love it when they made Miles promotion last December. But I've seen better from the other carriers.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-09;PER-AMS-PER in business. Malaysia airlines feels like a cut price airline rather than 5 star. Fare competitive and significantly less than other carriers. Lounges substandard especially in KL. No alcoholic drinks pre takeoff. 777 quite old and seats angled although reasonably comfortable. Service variable: professional on outward and staff called you by name. Unpolished and unfriendly on way back. Food terrible. brunch of vegetable fritatta with chicken sausage truly revolting and almost the only meal I haven't been able to eat in my life! Most carriers would consider this meal too substandard to serve in any class let alone business. Malaysia is ok if you are paying a discounted fare but avoid it otherwise.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-09;MH21 1 Dec 2013 Paris-KL. MH131 2 Dec 2013 KL-Auckland. My flight from Paris to KL was the best experience I have had on a plane. The plane was clean and new looking the food was great the staff were brilliant. When I jumped on my second MA flight from KL to Auckland it didn't compare at all to my first flight: the plane interior was shabby and the service was half of that of the Paris-KL service. Regardless of the second experience I still rate Malaysian Airlines as a brilliant economy-service airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-08;Took return flights to Australia via KL. Don't understand how MA qualify for 5 star rating. Outbound flights 17 Oct were both night flights from Heathrow and KL MH001 and MH123. First time travelling Business Class and didn't come up to expectations. Crew were noticeable by their absence and surly when present. Hospitality from the crew was minimal and not a smile in sight. Quality and choice of the food was disappointing lacking imagination. Return flights from Melbourne 04 Dec via KL. Both daytime flights MH148 and MH004 Crew were much better they seemed to want to deliver a good personable service making both return flights more enjoyable. Unfortunately the food again lacked imagination and therefore disappointing. To summarise standards of the crews on aircraft are inconsistent so its pot luck whether you have an enjoyable flight or not and food was consistently poor.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-08;HKG to KUL business class on A380. The business class product on this short flight was disappointing. The service was mediocre and food poor. My chair could not recline and luckily the seat next to me was empty and could be used. The upper deck business cabin lacks privacy and even though the seats are lie flat it was not comfortable. The IFE is adequate but pales in comparison to Emirates or Cathay. Headsets were given out 30 mins after take off and collected back 30 mins before landing! In Cathay the headsets are already attached at the seat and can be used throughout the flight. MAS has a long way to go to catching up with its competitors and it does not feel like a 5 star airline.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-08;Recently travelled to Bangkok from Kuala Lumpur. KUL-BKK was codeshare with Thai Airways so I had a chance to compare with Malaysia Airlines. BKK-KUL was operated on a B737-800. The seat pitch of this particular B737-800 was only 30' which was extremely tight! Like many reviews here it was way too tight even for a 2 hours flight. I am 178cm and I found some difficulties to sit comfortably on that seat for even 1 hour! Cant imagine how could they use this configuration as in LCC. They really need to do something on this! Cabin crews were slightly inorganic but efficient and generally responded well to requests though at times without a smile! The meal service was somehow pathetic: a small noodles with a small kitkat bar and a bite-size banana cake and all were quite tasteless. IFE option was substantially less compared to their Medium-Long haul flights: only a few movies and TV series. In comparison Thai Airways was far more comfortable as the seat pitch was at 34' and it offered a full meal service with a smile too! What a shame that I feel MH could do so much more!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-08;LHR - Jakarta on A380. I booked on MH as I'd read about the kid-free zone on the upper deck economy class cabin. This is not the case at all. In fact there seemed to be more babies and toddlers in this cabin than elsewhere on the aircraft! Overall the flight was fine which is probably about as much as you can hope for in Y class. Crew were efficient food was adequate although I'd have preferred sandwiches and a piece of fruit in the snack pack rather than peanuts and cookies. The IFE is reasonable but not as good as other 5* airlines. Similarly there were no little extras such as hot towels menus or amenity kits. Overall it didn't feel particularly 5 stars.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-06;HKG-KUL on 1/1/14 on the last MAS flight of the day. 737-800 refit has an extremely tight seat pitch configuration and this really affected comfort on the flight. The cabin crew did a really good job but when someone reclines it makes you feel claustrophobic so you need to stand up for a while then there is a problem. For anyone who wants to fly this airline between Hong Kong and KL I would recommend going for one of the earlier services on the A330-300 or the A380 where the seat configuration is more suitable. The 737s should be reserved for flights under 2hrs. Normally I would recommend this airline for long haul but for regional services I have been extremely disappointed.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-06;LHR-BKK-LHR. First the good. Flights were on time and bags arrived quickly and their cabin crew are great. The A380 was extremely comfortable particularly their flat bed. However we were a bit underwhelmed with the quality/choice of the food and drink on the intercontinental sectors (KUL-BKK-KUL was quite the opposite). Also although we flew on 4 January they AVOD system still only had December's programmes available. Don't know if this affected all MH flights or only our A380. Pretty poor though.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2014-01-02;Adelaide-Kuala Lumpur-Beijing. Happy with the Business Class product offered by Malaysia Airlines but if this airline wants to compete with the new player on the block in Adelaide Air Asia then clean the fuselages of your aeroplanes! A clean white Air Asia A330 (yes in all white colour) pulling up alongside Malaysia's sooty white fuselage is not a good look. Also noticed a dirty A330 at KL so ours was not a one off. Also hoping Business Class lounge at KL will be re-opened soon. One small gripe about food service lunch out of Adelaide was served at 11.30am after a 10 am departure. Was too soon. Two years ago a light breakfast was served with lunch later in the flight. Maybe a cost cutting exercise?;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-30;MH72 KUL-HKG. Was looking forward to flying the A380 in First as I prefer Asian carriers for travel. Airport check-in was fast and I was greatly relieved as there were huge lines for Business and Economy. The First Class Lounge is closed for refurb and the Business Lounge needs a refurb too. Boarding was easy. First has a separate entrance directly into the cabin. There are 8 seats and nothing special. The crew were very pleasant and the Dom Perignon champagne was great. The A380 already looked tired. I walked through the whole plane and was not impressed. The FC Galley is located directly behind the cabin which separates it from Economy. I don't know what they were thinking in this design. Luckily it was a short flight so all the clanging and banging didn't bother me. Had this been a long flight I would have been very upset. The menu was fairly minimal for the short brunch flight. I picked the lamb dish which wasn't bad but strange there was no salad offer. Dessert was an unopened carton of Haagan Daz with a plastic spoon. Next time I'll stick with Cathay or Japan Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-30;KUL-DPS on B777-200ER Business Class. The 16-year old plane is overly-dated together with its interior. Don't get me wrong the interior was nice and clean but you would know that the plane is from the last century. The good part is that the seat was less sophisticated than the newer planes meaning the leg-room is extremely spacious. Cabin crews are polite and nice but the food needs to be improved. Look forward to Malaysia Airlines replacing all of its B777-200 with A330-300 over the next 2 years. In the mean time Malaysia Airlines will be milking these workhorse planes prior to retirement meaning their Business Class tickets on B777-200 will competitively priced in the market.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-30;"Flew from London Heathrow to Sydney on 21st December 2013. Have flown with them several times previously and was always happy with the service. On this particular occasion I was disappointed. Both flights (LHR-KUL and KUL- SYD) were pretty full. In-flight service was interrupted several times by turbulence. I fly MH because of the 34"" seat pitch in Economy but on these two flights I felt like the space had been reduced somewhat. The food was awful out of four meals served only one was edible. Would I fly with them again? Possibly if there was a sale on airfares.";POSITIVE

malaysia-airlines;2013-12-25;"CDG-KUL-DPS and return end November mid December. Out on their A380 to KL and then a B777 on to Bali back on a 737 to KL and then A380 again home to France. Having flown business and even first class on other airlines of 4 and 5 star rating I cannot understand how MH have kept their 5 star rating particularly when it comes to ""food and beverages"". Food out more or less inedible their signature dish was OK but lukewarm main course burnt cheese course didn't appear and the desert was like eating cardboard (another signature dish). Food back sadly was the same although we were hoping for something better out of KL. The flights were on time and the cabin crew did their job no lost luggage. One of the toilets was out of use for the 13 hour flight back from KL to Paris but that happens. It was the best deal at that time from CDG to DPS but won't be flying with them again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-25;I have been using MAS to get in and out of Yangon in the last few months (10 sectors so far). I switched to them because they have good business fares that beat anything Silk Air or SIA have. It makes it worth the extra 44 minutes into KLIA out of Changi. Unfortunately in the last 3 trips I have seen 3 cancellations 5 delays and was at one point directed to 4 different gates over 5 hours for a flight from KLIA to Changi. Last trip out of Yangon was two hours late and I missed my connection in KLIA then got downgraded to economy and waited for two hours for the flight. So to make a long story short I am back flying Silk Air. It might be twice the price but they get you there on time and planning connections is possible. I like the MAS cabin crew and the product but the on time performance just keeps getting worse and KLIA is a train wreck.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-23;KUL-CGK previously had wide body flight at least once a day. Now all served using 737-8 which is small and crowded. Food desperately needs improvement as it is tasteless. Paying for the most expensive flight for this route when other bigger plane like KLM is just half the price of MAS with better inside facility but food and steward/ess are lousy.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-23;BNE-KUL-HKT 20th December. Timing of the Brisbane to Kuala Lumpur flight is such that you just want to get on the plane have a drink and try and sleep so not having a big meal served for me made perfect sense. Breakfast was more important and it was great without hot meal which I did not fancy. Good legroom in economy on the A330-300 smooth take-off and landings and friendly cabin service make MAS one of my favourite choices up to Kuala Lumpur. Onward flight to Phuket was pretty cramped but over quickly so my ratings are for Australia to Malaysia only.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-20;Brisbane to KL 15 November 2013 and returned on 23 November 2013. Travelled to Penang on 20th November and left Penang for KL and then to Brisbane on 23 November. Malaysia Airlines is one of the worst to fly with. The service is poor and on the trip there was no dinner given to passengers. No drinks were offered and when I asked for water it was ignored. On the way back we got no food except for a snack and then the meal was served just an hour before the plane landed at Brisbane Airport. I wont be flying them again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-17;I have been working in Brunei for the last 2.5 years so I am a frequent flier. My flight route takes me from ABZ to Miri via LHR and KL. The A380 airbus is an excellent plane it is roomy new and fresh. The cabin staff are a wonderful bunch who are always willing to help. I am extremely happy with all aspects Malaysia airlines have to offer from the airport itself to the lounges and most of all the wonderful Malay people. My baggage has never gone missing as things are very well organised. I have now reached platinum status and will continue to fly with MA for the foreseeable future.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-17;KUL-CDG 13 Dec on the A380 Upper Deck with family. Excellent and impeccable service provided by crew. Meals were sumptuous especially the quiche before landing.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-16;MH1 London to KL 11th Dec 2013 on A380. Fantastic experience for the moment I arrived at check in until I disembarked at KL. I missed my original flight (MH3) due to fog at London and was re-booked onto MH1. Lounge staff made the 8 hour wait a pleasure! The crew on the flight were excellent as was the food and service. (I was addressed by name frequently). The drinks just kept coming. The food was outstanding the best business food I have had large portions and each component cooked separately and assembled on the plate not all heated together on the same plate and served. They had taken time with the food and it showed. Very comfortable and roomy seats I am 6 feet 1 inch tall and had no issues at all even managed 6 hours sleep no problem with the bed comfort. If you are looking for a quality business product at an affordable price look no further.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-16;Disappointed with the services. Travelled from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur on MH787. The meal that I had pre-ordered was not provided. I ordered a seafood meal and got the vegetarian meal the flight attendant said there was nothing but pasta left - tasted horrible. When I asked for orange juice the flight attendant said all she had left was apple juice. No apologies just take it or leave it. When I requested headphones I was told the flight was too short! So I watched a silent movie for 1.5 hours. However on the flight I took from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket headphones were given to all passengers without requesting them. I don't expect this kind of service from a 5 star airline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-11;PEK-KUL on a cold and sunny late November morning in a B777-200. Flight not fully booked business class with roughly 60% occupancy. Plane left Beijing/Peking with a few minutes delay and had good tailwinds arriving in KL ahead of schedule. Seat comfort ok did not perform a thorough test of all technical options. The flight time of almost 6 hours gave the crew enough time to unwind all the famous service features of Malaysian and their personal charm as well: Food (brunch) superb and in generous rations - did not get my favourite choice due to limited stock but the alternative was really ok too. Beverage selection almost at the level of intercontinental first class but being a morning departure at 9am I restricted myself just the champagne and the white wine. The crew addressed the passengers by name. One hour before landing they offered their well known Satay service - this time lamb and chicken - and underlined their excellent service reputation. AVOD ok more options than I could ever use - I had to concentrate on F&B. Choice of newspapers and magazines limited compared to top European competitors.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-11;Flew from LAX-NRT-KUL-BLR. The service was really good the cabin crew were very courteous. Seating was quite comfortable. Food was great - enjoyed it but the airline fleet was a bit old. The Inflight screens were very old on 777-200LR from LAX to NRT the windows were scratched from KUL-BLR no personal screens on 737-800. Overall the airline fleet was old.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-04;Horrendous experience flying from London via Kuala Lumpur to Yangon. Flight MH3 was delayed by over 22 hours from 10.50 on 8/11/13 to 09.00 on 9/11/13 following a technical issue causing it to return to Kuala Lumpur. There was no attempt at warning anyone who was already checked in not to leave home very early to get to the airport even when the travel agent had over 25 people travelling. Unfortunately it then got worse. Returning to the airport on 9/11/13 I was unable to check in because no onward flights from Kuala Lumpur to Yangon were booked or available even though the previous day we had been reassured it would all be done and the travel agent had also been reassured. For the next 4 hours I had to queue at Customer Services hoping I wouldn't lose another day of my holiday. All they really seemed to want is for me to cancel the flight and go away. Eventually I travelled on Thai Airways and Bangkok Airways to Yangon who were great but the planes was full because of Malaysia Airlines. My luggage even managed to keep up. I tried to complain at Kuala Lumpur airport on my return journey but even the Duty Manager was not interested. The last few times I travelled with Malaysia Airlines they were really good but I won't bother again not after this experience.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-04;I always try to travel Malaysia Airlines to Australia and I travel a couple of times a year. Last trip was fantastic with the new plane but the main benefit is their brilliant customer service if something goes wrong. I've had to change my flight return several times with other airlines and nothing has beaten the sympathetic and efficient service of Malaysia Airlines. I always travel economy.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-04;"Flight MH 006 KUL-FRA on a B777-200ER was delayed (just as all other MH flights bound for Europe this very night) by about 90 min thus the plane left shortly before 1.30am made up almost an hour en-route and arrived 20 minutes late in FRA. Information policy on these and other delays was mediocre airport announcements given in English were almost incomprehensible (not an MH fault). After boarding there was only a brief apology for the delay no details given. The plane seemed fully booked did not see any vacant seat in front. Welcome drinks offered were non-alcoholic chilled and delicious. With the first beverage service at about 2.15am I tried to have a glass of champagne - got it and it was lukewarm like a cup of tea after 10 minutes. Tried to switch to the white Burgundy and later to the Mosella Riesling - all the same completely unacceptable. They tried to get me a cool glass of wine but had no ice cubes or dry ice (as other airlines use) and so there was no way. During the Satay service I was thus forced to switch to their red wine choices first took a glass of tasty Crozes Hermitage when I had almost finished the glass one too eager hostess filled this glass up with a standard Bordeaux - at almost 3 am I was not in the mood anymore to ask for a new service. This spoiled the whole meal service of course. The generous and high quality supper absolutely matched the expectations you have when you sit in a better class of a five star airline. My wife not drinking any alcohol was therefore extremely content with the service level offered. Seat quality fully ok not full flat seating but comfortable - had some good hours of sleep across Asia. AVOD was ok as well but the screen offered only limited resolution ""of times long gone by"". This should be addressed and resolved immediately. Breakfast in the morning was again of outstanding quality and variety able to feed hungry lions - really superb. I would have given a 9 or even 10 without the problems mentioned (so does my wife) but this flight showed that there is something to improve in the control processes.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-03;"CDG-KUL-CDG. I recently flew from CDG-KUL-CDG. I flew on the latest A380. The aircraft was new and spotless. The check-in was smooth the departure was on time. The flight crew were excellent. The inflight meals were tasty and adequate. I loved the breakfast which was shrimp and rice it was delicious. The cabin crew were friendly and kept smiling with professionalism. The IFE system was superb lots of variety and excellent touch-screen monitor. The seat was very comfortable and I had a wonderful sleep with enough legroom (I'm 6'2""). Overall I was very much satisfied with this airline and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-02;SYD-KUL-LGK-KUL-SYD: Firstly the long haul flights. SYD-KUL flight was on an aged B777-200 with small television screens and old broken seats. KUL-SYD flight was on a fairly new A330-300. The return flight landed 30 minutes late primarily due to the fact that it took the ground crew an hour to board the plane. On both flights the cabin crew were rude surly and inefficient. The food was generally appalling especially the sausage roll served two hours before landing and poorly planned with wine served mid morning and tea served in the afternoon. Drink runs were lacking on the both flights especially the return flight where I had to suggest that the cabin crew make one and even then they missed several rows of seats. The KUL-LGK-KUL flights were both serviced by extremely old B737-400. The fact that MAS still operates these planes is a disgrace. The interior was extremely dated the seats were broken and the air conditioner works poorly on the ground. The return flight landed 45 minutes late in KUL due to problems with the air conditioner. The cabin crew were younger and generally more pleasant on these flights. Overall MAS is inconsistent the cabins are dirty and I am baffled how it achieved the 5 star airline status.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-02;We can not fault their services at all. The flight to Thailand and then to Phuket were as smooth as the travel back to Australia. They catered for my husband who requested that if there was a possibility of getting a seat with more leg room could they let him know and they did. My boys requested for drinks and nibbles and got them pronto. Will definitely be flying Malaysia again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-02;JHB (Johor Bahru Malaysia) - KUL - KIX (KansaiJapan) on 18 Nov. Firstly JHB-KUL included service beverages and refreshments. But the flight from KUL-KIX was delayed 3 hours. Because the flight was full some passengers could upgrade from economy to business class for free and they just bought their tickets below RM 900 (JB-KUL-KIX). The provided breakfast was ok. Friendly crew on the flight a smooth landing at Kansai Airport.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-12-02;Flew last month with their leased b737-800 KUL-KCH. Cabin well kept. Not great like their new sky interior. Seat comfortable on this route. Cabin crew service was excellent. Friendly full of smiles helpful and professional.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-27;LHR-KUL-LHR. Booked this flight at a very reasonable price. The check-in was smooth ground staff really helpful as I lost my way to the gate. Cabin clean bright and new. Seats are comfortable after reclining it legroom was more than enough. Food served was tasty and comparable with other airlines such as Emirates Singapore Airlines and Qatar. IFE was installed with good selection of movies I could whatever I wanted. Throughout the flight the Cabin Crews were efficient and always smiling. Same service coming back too. Malaysia Airlines is really a great airline will not hesitate to fly them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-27;London to Kuala Lumpur 26/11/13 on A380. Flew business class to KL from Heathrow the plane was spotless upon boarding many pleasantries from the well presented cabin crew very helpful and obliging. Great food as well. Only a slight nag if you are taller than 5ft 10 then the flat bed is too short between the head board and the back of the seat in front ie you cant stretch out on your back to sleep. Other than that great experience and I am flying back in a few days on the 23.55 back to LHR - I hope it will be the same experience apart from the bed.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-27;Flew SIN-KUL-BNE return in business class. 737-800 for Singapore-KL and A330-300 for KL-Brisbane. 737 nice new planes and only a 45 min flight - service efficient but naturally basic. KL-BNE was day flight. Took off at 10am and the first meal service was 2 sandwiches and some fruit. There was then no other food served until 2 hours from Brisbane. What food was served was of a good quality but why it wasn't the other way around in terms of meals I really couldn't understand. Considering it is a reasonably new product I was very disappointed by the seat on the A330. It is narrow hard and doesn't got flat which on the night flight back from Brisbane makes a huge difference I think MAS are good and the value for money was very good but this is not a 5 star airline not even close. Compared to Qatar/Cathay etc they are miles behind.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-25;Flew NRT-KUL on the Boeing 777-200. It was a midnight flight on a clean spacious and comfortable seat. Slept very well the food was above average. The IFE was great as latest movies was installed. Crew was offering water through the whole flight. Overall Malaysia Airline's service really suits the 5-star awards.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-25;Although I do undertake around 10 long-haul trips per year this trip from Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam was my first leg with Malaysian Airlines. It was a bit of a disappointment as I had been looking forward to a new experience. I felt the cabin service was not of the quality expected and experienced with most other airlines. There was no eye contact and no smiles. There was an air of impatience too if a request for say a choice of main course required a second look at the menu. I just felt my server just wanted the chore of serving passengers to be completed as soon as possible. Having said that the flight was conducted professionally with pre-take off and landing checks in the cabin being completed diligently. I hesitate to recommend but this was of course a first time experience perhaps future trips would be better.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-22;We flew out of Perth November 5th on a late afternoon flight to KL and then on to Narita late evening. Dinner served an hour or so after takeoff. Then came an announcement that due to turbulence hot beverage service would be terminated seat belt sign went on and crew disappeared. Turbulence was minimal and we wondered what the fuss was about. During the early evening lights were dimmed and crew conspicuous by their absence and were not really seen until close to KL. Passengers observed going to galley and having to ask for water. The flight on to Narita followed the same pattern turbulence lights dimmed and little crew service. We had not flown with Malaysia for a long time and wondered if this was their normal standard of service and would it be the same again for our return journey. We departed Narita on the 19th late evening and our first observations were that we must be flying with a different airline! Service was great and crew pleasant and attentive at all times. Yes the announcement about turbulence was made and the seat belt sign came on but this did not faze the crew. The same excellent service was given on the KL to Perth sector.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-22;KUL-JHB with old 737-400. IFE was not installed but the seat is very large and comfortable. The flight attendant was hospitable and very polite. Refreshment was good during this short flight. Recommend to everyone for this 5-star service.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-19;KUL-BKK-KUL. Overall Malaysia airlines provided the best service on my flight. Nice crews good entertainment comfortable seats new aircraft and etc. The only imperfection was the food not tasty and a low class menu. Anyway I'll still fly with MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-18;SYD-KUL-KIX and back. All flights full. Excellent service lots and lots of food snacks cabin crew always offering drinks. IFE was good. Seats had lots of legroom and recline. Seats also very comfortable. Cabin crew very friendly however only one female cabin crew on first flight SYD to KUL who was in business class very surprising. Overall a pleasant experience. KLIA is a great airport to stopover at. Highly recommend Malaysia Airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-18;I decided to go with Malaysia Airlines instead of Jetstar because you get full service meals drinks entertainment etc but it was a horrible old plane food inedible costing me around $1000 from Melbourne to Phnom Penh. Rude staff uncomfortable seating (economy) poor selection of entertainment. Coming back to Melbourne I was seated at the back right next to the toilets smelt horrible. Never again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-12;KL to Hanoi on B737-800. MAS are making significant efforts to compete. Their service is outstanding quality of food and wine very good. Seat comfort on the short haul flights is similar to other airlines in 2x2 configuration aircraft quite new. MAS provides prices which are almost always lower than Thai or CX not to mention SIA.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-12;MAS operates old B777 on FRA to KL with no full flat bed and seat layout is 2x3x2. Service is perfect food and wine excellent. They deserve more attention and a full flat bed in Business class.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;"Hong Kong to KL to Adelaide a bad day for Malaysia Airlines. Scheduled departure 2:40pm but major delay to aircraft arriving. Departure estimated to be 4:30pm but eventually closer to 6:00pm. Captain cited technical issues but no other explanation. Flight OK up until half hour out of KL. Entered holding pattern due to ""traffic conditions"" at KLIA. We were not too concerned as we had experienced something similar flying in from Adelaide a few days earlier but by now we had eaten up our 4 hour transit to catch a connection home. After 3 or 4 circuitsthe co-pilot announced some ""unexpected news"" that we were diverting to Penang due to the fuel situation. We proceeded to Penang with a later assurance that we had plenty of fuel to get there. In my experience most airlines have problems from time to time with weather equipment and other factors out of their control but it is how they handle the situation and their paying customers that is a true measure of their quality. This situation unfortunately highlighted some deficiencies with Malaysian Airlines systems and processes. We got plenty of apologies but not much more. On landing at Penang we were given very little information about what would happen. We got the usual announcements about not moving until the seat belt light goes out but nothing about what would happen next. Passengers gathered their possessions and stood up expecting to disembark but silence. Eventually after about half an hour the pilot announced that the flight crew had exceeded their allowed flying time and another crew would need to be flown up from KL to fly the aircraft back and this would be about 12:30am ( we landed at about 9:30pm). So there we sat for 3 hours. The cabin crew were conspicuous by their absence and it was hard to identify anyone in charge. Very little attempt was made to make an effort to look after the comfort of the passengers and almost no information or updates were passed on until the replacement crew arrived around midnight. Of course the headphones had been collected before landing so we could not pass the time watching a movie. It was possible to go and get a drink from the galley if you were able to get past the groups of agitated passengers. Eventually we left around 1am and arrived at 2am at KL. On arrival we were given vouchers for hotel and taxi and boarding passes for a flight to Adelaide the following evening and pushed out of the airport without our luggage. I suppose we should be grateful that Malaysian Airlines found accommodation for us but it was in a village called Sepang about half an hour from the airport and while rated 3 stars I think this would be rather optimistic. I could not help thinking that this was a pretty cheap effort and this was reinforced by the expression on the face of one of the ground staff who asked us where we had been accommodated. In the end we arrived home 24hours late and minus one bag. This experience raised many questions about Malaysia Airlines' commitment to passenger satisfaction and comfort their cabin crew organisation the suitability of KLIA as a hub their fueling policies and procedures and their management in general. It is hard to imagine a circumstance where I would consider travelling with them again.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;KUL to SYD - flight delayed because baggage can't be loaded problem was not MAS but airport facilities in KL. Kept informed by Captain whom decided to leave without some bags rather than indefinite delay - fair enough. Very full flight and extraordinary number of small babies - all of whom wailed on take off and landing. Cramped and noisy flight. Difficult seating arrangements for families especially those with small children and babies. Cabin crew civil but not usual friendly service. Filthy toilets but some what understandable given the very full flight and origin of some passengers. I do wish they'd managed more cleaning of the toilets but the state of the cabin on landing is horrendous. My bag didn't arrive on the same flight and was delivered the next day. I imagine this was just awful for many people but I coped ok till the next day. All this is within reason and managed as best as possible. My big complaint is the food. The second 'snack' of the sausage roll really needs to be changed. How many people have to complain before the airline does something about this. Why be known as the airline that you have to bring your own food before you fly? Change the sausage roll it truly deserves to be dropped. It is horrendous and it's the first and last thing I think of when flying MAS economy.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;Adelaide-KL-Phuket return. Firstly they ran late for every flight. No drinks regularly offered you had to ask constantly for water cups of tea and coffee served with powdered milk. The food is disgusting dried up pastry sausage roll. The meals were awful and half the food was left off my husbands tray. Our final journey KL to Adelaide I just wanted to cry I was so uncomfortable in my seat.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;IST-KUL-BNE in late October. We fly annually to Europe with MAS. The service only seems to get better. The cabin crew were uniformly helpful and pleasant. Food and beverage service very good. The only area needing improvement is their lounge at KL which is getting a bit tired and at times very crowded. Also the lounge used at Istanbul being the Millenium Lounge is an embarrassment. Any of the other lounges would be a better choice by MAS. We will continue to fly Malaysia Airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;Over the years Malaysia Airlines is going bad. The service is one of the worst I have ever had. Heard a lot of people say the cabin crew treat Asians differently if compared to Europeans. I guess where you come from affects their service towards you. Everything in Malaysia Airlines is downgraded the comfort the services the food etc.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-10;LHR-KUL-SYD in Business class. LHR-KUL on the A380. Check-in agent at LHR very friendly and advised of fast-track through security and location of lounge. First class lounge (due to OneWorld Emerald status) very nice with great views of the tarmac and having a good selection of food at the buffet stand. A-la-carte menu was of excellent quality. The staff at the lounge were very helpful friendly and accommodating making the experience a complete pleasure. Priority boarding not quite what it should be as there is a boarding gate for business class passengers and economy passengers on the upper deck who board together and a separate boarding gate for first class passengers and economy passengers on the lower deck. Despite this boarding was relatively quick orderly and efficient. Non-alcoholic pre- departure drinks offered. Flight was delayed due to a crew member being injured prior to departure and they had to wait for a replacement crew to arrive. Seat was very comfortable in both the sitting and flat positions. There was also plenty of storage space for personal items. Good selection of IFE with a reasonable amount of latest releases. Cabin crew were excellent on this sector. They were very friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Pre-ordered meal through their Chef-on-call service was honoured. Quality of meals on this sector was quite good. Flight arrived late into KUL but some time was made up in the air. However it meant that the connection for the flight to SYD was still a bit tight. KUL-SYD was on a new A330-300. This flight was held back to ensure that connecting passengers and their luggage made it onto the flight which was much appreciated. Cabin crew again were great on this flight. My pre- ordered meal was honoured and it was excellent. This was probably the best steak I've ever had in the air! The satay of course was excellent. IFE similar to what was on offer on the A380 flight from LHR to KUL. The seat is comfortable in the sitting position but not so much in the angled flat position. Storage space for personal items is very poor on these seats. Flight arrived an hour late into SYD. Check-in luggage did make it through but did not come out first. However I was just glad that the luggage made it to SYD. Overall a great experience and one that I will continue to use due to the consistency of service standards and good value for money.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-06;Travelled London to Melbourne and return via Kuala Lumpur on A380 and A330. What was otherwise a pleasant journey was marred by poor quality of food served on all 4 legs.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-06;MEL-KUL-PNH/BKK-KUL-MEL. Everything was just ok not fantastic with this so-called 5 star airline. The most disappointing was the catering - very average. How could they serve us a below-par sausage roll for a main meal. I noted they are cutting corner with food. Why? I don't know. The best was 30 kg luggage allowance and that's all. Will fly with them again if the price is right (cheap) but have to bring my own food along.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;LAX-NRT-KL-DPS and return. Where did this gem of an airline come from. Usually take JAL or Cathy Pacific - but the ticket price was worth a chance. Unbelievable Satay and meals. Gate staff in NRT were a bit frigid but all others were spot on. FA both male and female were wonderful and took the time to talk with the passengers about themselves. Unfortunately they had to apologise for the seats and knew that they were not the greatest - but at least they were honest. Video movie etc on a par with the other carriers. KL lounge was beautiful - unlike LAX - but the shared lounge in NRT had little to no food - but they went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. Top shelf service based on the value of the ticket. Can hardly wait to fly them again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;SYD-KUL-CGK-KUL-PEK PVG-KUL-SYD in Business. I have to say the service improved a lot with MH this time. Not every leg was great but I have to say most of legs are better than I expected and better than my last experience with MH. I discovered I could use QF first lounge in SYD as a Emerald member great experience as always. service between SYD KUL SYD are better than medium haul such as KUL-PEK and PVG-KUL. KUL-CGK-KUL legs are okay but nothing special. For 2 hours flights it is okay. No toiletry bags was distributed for 6 hours flight from KUL to PEK. PVG-KUL leg was not great one of staff in business class was really unprofessional. I ordered chef on demand when I booked my ticket but seem they mixed up my booking. Never mind the staff member was really unprofessional could not care less it is airline mixed up the meals. The flight could not land in KL due to the bad weather. We have to land in Penang and waited for two more hours. First lounge in KL is good but so dated. I think MH is going to do some renovation. Seats are not great you can only have 3 positions and not designed for lounging only for sit and sleep. It was a much better trip than my previous trip with MH. I hope MH could keep it up as I am going to travel again in couple of weeks.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;My wife and I travelled from London to KL on MH3. 10.50am on 29th Oct 2013. I would like to comment about the food. The fruits were either too hard or too soft. It would be better to serve only ripe fruits as the rest is inedible. Chose fruits that travel well and put them together. The watermelon was over-ripe and the kiwi fruit was rock hard. Also the satay beef was too dry. This is the second time I have noticed this in Business class recently.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;KUL-CDG. Experienced a wonderful time on board the MAS A380. FA's were extremely attentive friendly nonetheless. The reclined seat was comfortable. IFE was OK with a variety of international and local films. Worth every penny flying with MAS. Highly recommended to all.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;Flew Malaysia Airlines 4 times in the last month. The flight departing Kuala Lumpur to Sydney at 22.50 provided no evening meal but a snack only. This turned out to be an inedible mushroom sausage roll. The alternative (non vegetarian) was not available. This is clearly inadequate for a 5 star airline particularly as we had been on a connecting flight with a 3 hour transit at KL and the breakfast serving would not be for 5 hours. Malaysia certainly need to lift their catering for long haul flights.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;Flight MH001 - LHR-KL. In a word excellent. IFE food comfort and service cannot be faulted. Clean spacious A380 professional cabin crew. Flight MH1164 - KL-PEN. Good efficient short-haul connection.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-11-04;"Firstly we arrived at Melbourne Airport with a stack of ski gear right up to our luggage limit. One of us was over one under - one spot on. The lady just asked for passports and said ""they're being strict on the luggage tonight just shuffle some stuff between the bags and I'll weigh them again"". We got the same at Narita on the way home (even when we were running a little late because of a train ticket mix up on the way). Food was good (except for those disgusting chicken sausage roll things we got for the ""light snack"") and the vegetarian options are a little crap. Seats were comfortable with wings that allowed you to get some shut eye on the full flights. Leg room was ok (but I'm 6'3"") so I'm used to being uncomfortable sitting anywhere. Drinks came around every hour to keep everyone hydrated. The entertainment system was fine staff were pleasant.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-31;I had 4 flights with Malaysia last month Sydney to Istanbul via KL and return. I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews here but I have to say that I was delighted with everything. The person next to me on the IST - KUL leg left some belongings in the lounge and told the onboard staff who sent someone to retrieve them! Service was excellent and wonderful value for money. I'm not tall and didn't find the angled seats a problem. The only problem on this flight was having to turn off all electronic devices even those in flight mode which was a bit annoying as I only had a Kindle and a tablet to read as something was causing interference in the cockpit.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-31;KUL-Heathrow. Great airline. The plane was clean and the staff were friendly. There was an excellent choice of films documentary comedy etc. The food was great for airline food even a smoked salmon side salad. I would fly with this company again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-30;KUL-HKG-KUL Economy Class on A380. Full flight both ways. Boarding at KUL was chaotic due to change of departure gate at the very last minute which also resulted in late departure from KUL. Assigned seat was taken by another passenger and was informed by the passenger that the stewardess told her to seat there. Had to wait for almost 10 minutes while the cabin crew rearranging the seating according to the seat number stated on the boarding pass. Meals were good on both sector. IFE crashed 3 times and the supervisor only managed to fix the problem one-hour before touchdown at HKG. Cabin crew were not interested in their job.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-30;KL - Denpasar - KL using rewards ticket. Both flights on time bags out quickly decent quality food and drink very friendly cabin crew. Very good experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-30;Travelled COK-KUL-MEL MH129 Oct 2013. The 737-800 on the COK-KUL sector was congested but the 777 on the KUL-MEL sector was okay. Inflight service was perhaps the worst we have encountered. The catering was most noticeable as meals were insufficient and no choice of drinks. Malaysia Airlines is cost cutting even on tea and coffee. I suppose you get what you pay for. Will never travel Malaysia Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-29;Return trip from Brisbane to Bangkok. First time on the 330 on the Brisbane to KL leg. Had read other reviews which were critical of the seating comfort on the 330 but I found the comfort more than acceptable. Cabin crew very attentive and food excellent. Had booked a meal using Chef on Call and was served the meal for breakfast. Flight to BKK was on a 737-800. Was an older plane with no IFE but cabin crew were good. Flight on the return from BKK to KL was on a newer 737-800 with IFE. Only complaint for the return flight to BNE is that was more than 2.5 hours into the flight before I was able to get my first drink and that was after asking for it. After that no problems having wine etc topped up. Food was very good and the Lobster Thermidor was better than that on SQ.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-29;LAX-NRT-LAX Economy. I purchased the ticket while they were on special offer the fare was very reasonable. LAR-NRT: Check in staff were not friendly aircraft was old but the seat was comfortable. Entertainment system crashed twice and the sound and screen quality was bad. Inflight service was okay and the food was average. NRT-LAX: Check in very slow. Poor entertainment service and the flight attendant who delivered our meals (dinner and breakfast) was disrespectful. I wouldn't recommend this airline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-29;What an absolutely non-customer service focused Airline. Never again will I fly with Malaysian Airlines. It was the first and last time. Normally I fly with Singapore or Emirates but had seen some reviews saying that Malaysian was good. How wrong could you be. 19 hours delayed bag lost. When I missed our connection due to delays not one person from Malaysian made any effort to help over 20 people also delayed with me. I arrived Terminal 1 Heathrow was told to go to the tranist area in terminal 4 where I was turned away by security. I then had to return to Terminal 1. I then queued for an hour at least before I was told to go landside for assistance. This then took four hours before I was rebooked. I was then given some pittance value food vouchers that were only eligible in a terminal I was not departing from. Then even though the staff had over 9 hours before I departed on my rebooked flight (with Etihad) I was told on departure my bags would not make it. My single stop trip had also been turned into a 2 stop trip which added another 6-8 hours. No help whatsoever when they lost my bag just left at an airport in Australia with no clothes. Pay a little extra and travel with Singapore Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-29;Travelled on the new 787 plane LHR to KL and sat in the upper deck seat no: 33H an aisle seat in a row of 2. Was impressed with the cabin which is small (about 10 rows) and has a seat configuration of 2-4-2 unlike the lower deck which has rows of 3-5-3 in economy. Service was very good and food reasonable with frequent snacks on offer. Boarding in this cabin is also smoother than in the lower deck as you board using the same door as business class. Plenty of films/TV shows etc to watch including recent films as well as classics. Absolutely no complaints at all once I was on board. However Malaysian Airlines customer service is the worst I have come across and was so incompetent/rude on the several occasions that I dealt with them that I will never travel with them again. In London before my flight they would not allow me access to my flight details on the internet and refused to reserve me a seat: in Bali I was unable to contact the office either by phone or in person to change the date of my flight to KL and was forced to fly with another airline although I had paid for a flight with Malaysian Airlines and in Kuala Lumpur I spent 5 hours in their office trying to ensure my flight back to the UK would not be cancelled. A woman seating next to me in the main MA office had been there 2 days waiting to speak to a customer service adviser.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-25;In July 2013 my husband and flew to Sri Lanka from Melbourne for a 3 week holiday. The flight was good from Melbourne to Malaysia short turn around then on to Colombo. The return was hoped to go as smoothly but not to be. I have two issues with the airline both about treatment to passengers. Firstly flying from Colombo to Malaysia we were subjected to extremely loud promotional material about the airline for over 30 minutes. It left us with fingers in our ears and quite annoyed as it was very early morning. Many people were clearly discomforted by it and a request by another passenger to turn it down was ignored. That alone would lead me to not fly again. I made the mistake of ordering a vegetarian meal on the flight over and had the most bland and unimaginative food possible. My husband enjoyed his food but noted it was considerably poorer quality on the flight back to Australia. I will avoid this airline from now on and next flight was booked with Singapore Airlines.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-22;PER-KUL-LHR. After reading the reviews on here I was a bit sceptical about flying but was very pleased. The food was excellent the crew were very efficient and pleasant could not fault any of this. The seat comfort was ok once the optimum position was found. The pillow and duvet were fine considering how much cheaper they are than EK or QR it did not lack in quality in comparison with the ticket price.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-22;We travelled from Hong Kong to Adelaide on 21-22/10/2013 and the leg from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur on the A380 was easily the best flight in 15 years of travelling on Asian airlines that I have encountered. Seating had plenty of leg room (something missing on the A330-300 from Kuala Lumpur to Adelaide) and the cabin service was unbelievably good. The staff actually looked to be enjoying their job. Will certainly be flying Malaysia Airlines again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-22;SIN-KUL-AKL. I don't think they deserve to be classified as s 5 star airlines I traveled with Thai Airways from Singapore to Auckland and their plane was much newer better food and flight attendants were friendlier. I boarded a very old Boeing 737 from Singapore to KUL with connecting flight from KL to Auckland. The aircraft from Singapore to KL was old with many of the seat arm rests torn off. Some staff were not friendly we were served a dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible and the inflight entertainment took a long time to work after take off. A real disappointment.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-20;LHR-KUL-BNE. Thankfully only one way. Having flown Singapore Airlines Emirates Kingfisher Air Asia Malaysian Airlines were a real disappoint. Most disappointing was the customer service which was badly lacking. Very strict on luggage limits. Poor food service taking a long time after take off to serve no regular checks on passengers for drinks or food and generally unfriendly. Perhaps the cabin crew were having a bad day but given the choice of competitors we won't be flying this airline again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-20;IST to KUL in business October 2013. Flight delayed 7 hours due to technical problem on the ageing 777-200. We were bussed to a nearby hotel but hotel and especially food provided was of low quality. Once we did take off the plane was showing its age although I found seat pitch generous and slept ok on the angled lie flat seat. No champagne before take off and no satay which they brag so much about. The older all male crew were efficient but not warm or attentive. IFE pretty poor compared to BA Emirates etc. Amenity bag small but adequate. Their A380 may be better but overall the experience fell a long way short of market leaders.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-15;KUL-MEL 6 Oct MH 129. Been travelling Malaysia Airlines regularly over 20 years now have noticed their inflight catering and staff attitude (some of them) is getting worse and rather appalling. They need to start treating all Economy passengers much better. Recent flights got served a snack from / to Australia flights. Dried pastry overcooked and almost inedible lucky to get a second drink if you needed one. Very disappointing. They could take a tip from Air Asia Staff.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-15;KCH-KUL-HKG-YVR. MH2597 (KCH-KUL) overnight in KL then MH072 (KUL-HKG) before transferring to CX 838 (HKG-YVR). The planes used on both MH sectors were pretty new with a 737-800 and A380-800 used on the first and second sector respectively. Both flights left on time and the flights were smooth with no problems encountered. The 737-800 interiors were brand new and comfortable enough for a 90 minute flight. Cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The A380 interiors were showing a bit of wear and tear some of the carpets in the high-traffic areas near the washrooms were a bit worn out. Cabin crew on this flight were also efficient and worked well as a team. A relatively short flight (just under 4 hours) so didn't bother with the entertainment system. Seating on both flights were comfortable enough and the food was hot and tasty but nothing special. Would be nice if they brought pineapple juice back like they used to have about 15 years ago. The orange and apple juice options are getting a bit boring.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-13;9/10/2013. BKK-KUL. On their new B737-800. Love the interior design. Sky-interior and leather seat. Good legroom for 2 hours flight. Staff service was amazing. Full of smile friendly and cheerful. Food not much to say. Just delicious. Inflight entertainment provided on this route. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-13;MEL-KUL in business. Disappointing flight with very little attention from crew who had the annoying habit of talking to you with their heads turned away. It meant that they had to begrudgingly repeat what they'd said much to the frustration of all. How they won worlds best cabin crew is inconceivable. Angled lie flat seat comfort ok. Drinks haphazard. Pillows a joke - so thin you'd get more support using the blanket. Meals surprising - a feta cheese pie and orange juice for dinner! More in keeping with a budget carrier.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-10;AMS-KUL-MEL. A pleasant flight operated by a B777 on the AMS-KUL sector (MH17). The flight attendants in business class were impressive: well-organised and very responsive. Plenty of room between the seats. On the other hand the KUL-MEL sector (MH129) was operated by an A330 with the seats being smaller and the pitch noticeably tighter. Very prompt service of the sandwich refreshment shortly after take off much appreciated by those (probably the majority) who had transferred from in-bound flights and who were anxious to relax. Service of the main meal before arriving in MEL was significantly slower!;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-10;KUL-HKG-KUL in economy. A squeaky-clean A380. Boarding orderly departures on time. arrivals ahead of schedule. Good newspaper selection. Comfortable seats. Food much nicer than on B737s that MAS flies regionally. Crew very pleasant attentive chatty generous with drinks fluent in English/Malay/Mandarin. Haagen-Dazs ice cream was served. Overall a great flight.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-10;Below average airline for the price they charge. The much cheaper Air Asia was better in service. Some seats wouldn't push back absolutely no in-flight entertainment (in KUL-HYD sector) and average food. Had a bad experience with the staff not wanting to check-in a hand baggage at the gate a request that most airlines would accommodate.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-09;Heathrow-Kuala Lumpur-Sydney. After boarding at Heathrow the entire A380 stayed on the tarmac for 4 hours due to a failure to lodge the flight authorisation form with Heathrow. This delay means that after a 13hr flight to KL we missed our connecting to Sydney. No one on the plane was able to assist passengers that needed connecting flight and upon arrival at KL no one helped with the transfer counter either. Ground staff were incredibly rude unhelpful and tried to refuse us food vouchers. They simply handed us a computer printout and told us to go to Cathy Pacific counter for a boarding pass. Turns out they stuck us on a flight from KL to Hong Kong then to Sydney. That flight was full and we were sent back to line up again with Malaysia Airlines. This happened twice more and it was 4 hours standing at the transfer counter before we were put on a flight to Singapore then Sydney. When we arrived in Sydney 12 hours later than the original flight our checked in bags were missing. Turns out our bags were still in KL. No apology.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-07;SIN-KUL-BKK-KUL-SIN. All 4 flights on fairly new 737-800's I pre booked seats 5F and 5A on all flights checked in at SIN very late only 40 min before departure but the great staff and the ever efficient Changi Airport made this a non issue. SIN-KUL flight only around 50 min with a snack served I used the Malaysian lounge in KL and it is very comfortable the food served was of good standard too. Flight to BKK around 2hrs with a meal served arrived on time. Return check in quick used the Thai lounge in satellite E which is fine once again flight to KUL lasted just over 2 hours a choice of meals which were good quality. back in KUL had around 1 hour before connecting back to SIN a great trip enjoyed the service on new aircraft look forward to using MH again.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-07;SYD-KUL-LHR in Business class. SYD-KUL on new A330-300. Very friendly check-in with fast-track through immigration and security. Used Qantas First Lounge as a OneWorld Emerald member which was just fantastic. Priority boarding provided and was in an organised fashion. No alcoholic beverages for pre-departure drinks. Flight departed on time. Seat was comfortable in the sitting and recline positions but are angled flat. This was not a problem as it was a day flight. IFE was AVOD but a little limited on latest releases. On-board catering was disappointing on this flight. Cabin crew friendly courteous and helpful. Flight arrived early into KUL. Lounge in KUL was reasonably good but the catering was disappointing. Shower facilities are getting tired but they did the job. KUL- LHR on A380. No priority screening or boarding for this flight. Again no alcoholic beverages prior to departure. Flight departed a little early. Seat was very comfortable in the sitting position and turns into a flat-bed which was also very comfortable and allowed me to get almost 7 hours sleep on the 12.5 hour flight. The kink in the leg- rest part of the seat which was previously a bit of a problem appears to have been fixed and straightened. The lavatories on these planes a very spacious. IFE much better on this flight with a lot more latest releases. Catering overall was also disappointing on this flight except for the excellent satay. The cabin crew on this flight were fantastic and it made the whole experience a pleasure. We arrived a little early. This was not my final destination but priority baggage was quickly delivered. A solid business class product overall but catering needs to improve. Excellent value for money.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-07;Flew Business from London to Perth and thought the overall experience was good. The seats were better than I expected after reading this forum and the service staff on my flight were all polite and helpful. Food was excellent. The only main negative point was that the inflight entertainment was rubbish compared to what you get on other airlines. A real disappointment especially when flying long haul.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-07;Melbourne to Delhi on Oct 1 and while MEL-KUL leg was okay - even though we were woken up a few hours before arrival into KL and offered a breakfast of rice and prawn (the option was frittata had run out). The second KUL- DEL was the worst flight I have been on. We were sitting in a 737 which had only 2 toilets for the 120+ passengers flight felt like a domestic short haul flight but ended up being a torturous long haul. I understand that there was a delay due to unforeseen circumstances. The crew were far too young and far too involved in their own chatter at the back of the plane people had to go up to ask for water and biscuits. Flight was bumpy so the seatbelt light was on and no tea or coffee could be served. I asked for Sprite and it had run out. When the seatbelt sign went off we had to ring the call bell to ask for tea and coffee. It was a very unpleasant experience - and one that has me convinced that something has gone downhill in this supposedly five star airline it was the first time I had flown Malaysia and there won't be a second. I had tried to web check in exactly 48 hours before on my return and found most seats blocked.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-07;KUL-ADL MEL-KUL Business class. MAS Adelaide check-in for return trip failed to provide the fast-track immigration pass needed in Melbourne and was rudely ejected from fast-track queue despite showing business class boarding pass. Queued over 30mins in slow lane. Seats when fully reclined are very uncomfortable. On return flight only one particularly rude FA insisted that small bag in foot well be stowed for takeoff and landing. Never seen this before. MAS impossible to get hold of by phone despite promised callback service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-02;Flew First Class KL to LHR on the A380. Aircraft was new and only 8 seats in First Class so felt like a rock star. Seat was fantastic and huge TV screen. IFE was fantastic. Flight attendants great - very friendly and attentive but not overly familiar. Food and beverage was business class standard - limited choices of wines (FAs couldn't really explain about the wines other than red or white) food choices were not what I would have expected from first class. Overall first class cabin with business class service.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-02;Flew business class from Sydney to KL. Aircraft was new and very clean check in was smooth FAs were friendly and attentive and well above average. Meals were good though not great wine selection OK. IFE was great.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-01;Flew KUL-MEL on their new A330. Nice and modern cabin. Good selection of inflight entertainment except for the annoying ads at the start of every movie/show. However the cabin crew were appalling! They seemed uninterested and made their passengers felt like they are a burden.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-10-01;My wife and I flew Business Class Perth to Kuala Lumpur A330 then A380 to London 2nd July 2013 then back to Perth by the reverse route 28th September 2013. 10 out of 10 to MAS because all 4 flights were excellent. We were so well looked after by the very friendly and efficient cabin crew who could not have done more to make our journey as pleasant as possible. As a retired Airline Captain I have travelled the world for many years and I can thoroughly recommend MAS.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-30;Travelled from Bangalore to Singapore and Singapore to Delhi last week (both ways stopped at KL). I must say that quality has gone down very much compared to 2008-9. The staff is not at all caring. The food was very oily. The staff is more concerned about finishing their tasks and are not really concerned about customer. Empathy is totally missing.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-26;BNE-KUL-LHR on 18/9/2013. BNE to KUL on an A320. KUL to LHR on A380. Flights were on time or earlier. Crew on both flights were excellent. We have flown this route frequently with MAS and have found their service and comfort good. Food was excellent on both flights. Lounge at KUL is getting a bit tired in the area of the showers but does the job.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-26;Flew Adelaide to London and back again in Aug/Sep 2013 business class. The A330 from Adelaide to KL has to be the most uncomfortable seating experience I have ever had and as far as converting into a bed and getting any sleep that is quite impossible. The A380 KL to London is comfortable but Malaysia Airlines has chosen the most basic of fit outs and this shows (I flew Emirates recently on the A380 in business class so can make a direct comparison). As always staff polite and helpful and food good but the planes let the airline down badly. Will not be using them again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-26;Flew SYD to MLE via KL. SYD-KL was in A330-300 then 737-800 to Male. Airbus had very comfy seats good food and service and very good individual inflight entertainment. 737 had typically uncomfortable seats fairly good food but had a few small flat screens for all to watch. Terrible movie featured. Downloaded some movies on the IPhone for the return trip so I didn't have to endure that again. Price was good though. Had a 15 hour layover in KL the way there and 2.5hrs the way back. Was really happy with the 15 hours visit to KL and had a fantastic time shopping and sightseeing there. Got a beautiful hotel room for $100 US which gave us two 2-hour sleeps to refresh us. Service good on all legs. Very hard to sleep through the night in Economy seats. Would happily fly MAS again but would likely prioritise AirAsia as you can get a Flatbed in Premium class for the same fare as Economy in MAS and most other full-service airlines.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-24;SYD-KUL-LHR return. Malaysia aren't that bad - they are just not as good as the competition. The A380 leg between KL and Heathrow is ok if not as good as rivals but the Business class seats on offer between KL and Australia are extremely poor. The Service is friendly and efficient but every flight I have taken with them has ether had problems with lavatories broken seats (other passengers) or problems of one sort or another. Also on a two hour delay with connecting flights to London there was no info provided about if the connecting flight was being held or not. Now that Qantas had upgraded it's offerings Malaysian is definitely the poor cousin if flying between Australia and Europe.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-24;LHR-PEN via KUL and return. A380 is a super quiet plane. Sat on upper deck at the rear of the plane. On the way out the crew were excellent. On return not quite as outstanding. The food and beverages were ok although lacking on return trip. Seat fairly comfortable. Brilliant to be able to watch the take off and landing from camera positioned on tail of the aircraft. Over all quite comfortable with adequate leg room. I would fly MAS again. It was nice to see the mood lighting enjoyed by Business class passengers gradually getting brighter but in economy they whacked up the bright white lighting which was not very pleasant. I can't understand why this feature is not available throughout the cabins especially on such a new aircraft.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-24;KUL-HKG A380 - Overall flight was satisfactory for this regional sector although might loose out in the long hauls. Positives - food from KUL was of good quality and cabin crew were very friendly. Drawbacks - sleeping position is not 100% flat and most would only be able to sleep on their backs without moving about the table is way too small for its class and the serving tray during meals can barely fit the dishes on it the handset for the inflight entertainment system is a little hard to use and the screens in this cabin are non-touch.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-22;LHR-KUL-HKG in Business Class. Two wonderful flights with great customer service. The business class seats in the A380 (LHR-KUL) are spacious and comfortable. MH offers a nice variety of meal selections. The food was tasty. The second flight was on an B737-800. I was in first row. The seats are comfortable and the food was also tasty. The crew on this flight was fantastic.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-22;KUL-CDG on A380. The aircraft is nice and entertainment system was sufficient for the long flight. But the crews were terrible. Poor services throughout the flight not attentive to the needs of passengers and when requesting anything seemed reluctant to provide anything. No smiles from the crew. Definitely not a 5 star airlines with this kind of poor service.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-19;"Our family flew from Australia to Malaysia and took several short hops up and down to Singapore on MAS before flying back to Australia. The cabin crew invariably made us feel welcome with our young children and were extremely helpful all along the way. Mostly new B 737-800s and A 330-300s with decent inflight entertainment options too. But the standard of catering on the long haul sector has dropped dramatically over the years. On the outbound overnight flight we were offered a disappointing mushroom or chicken roll for supper and the same dish appeared as ""breakfast"" on the flight back. There may be some savings to be had in cutting back catering but I think MAS has gone too far when compared to the competition.";POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-18;Finished 5 domestic sectors with MAS over the last two months (KUL-SDK-KUL SBW-KUL-SBW-KUL) on old B734 and new B738 MAS is certainly not a 5-star airline anymore. Having flown with so many other airlines in the past their services were not better than most of them. The male cabin crew were mostly rude and unhelpful. Was this what you should expect from an airline who once claimed to have 'World Best Cabin Crew'. They are an OK airline but definitely not a 5-star airline.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-17;We have just completed the first leg of our holiday travelling on the A330-300 aircraft from Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur then the A380 to Paris. We sat in the second row. I had read previous reviews which had criticised the seat comfort of the A330 so it was with some trepidation that I felt how firm the seat was. However my fears proved to be unfounded. The seat is able to be adjusted in multiple ways. The staff on this leg were outstanding. The second leg was in the A380 we had booked seats in the smaller front business section and these were very comfortable. We both were able to get a number of hours sleep. Again the staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative was my meal on this flight which was overcooked. We are sure our return journey will also be enjoyable.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-15;Flew MEL to BKK with a 2 month old A330 and a new 737. The standout was the new aircraft. The A330 was so comfortable modern and beautiful! The seats were extremely comfortable for economy. However everything else was pretty poor most of all the cabin crew. They were horrific! I never thought that cabin crew could be so rude to the point that it made passengers feel uncomfortable. The only reason I would fly with this airline is because of the new aircraft and its beautiful hub (KUL) is always a pleasure to transit through. Everything else was atrocious! If you want service do not fly MAS!;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-15;Flight from Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne 8/9/13. Plane a little dated but I can cope with this bad service however is a different story. Just after meals were served I got quite a bad blood nose after which I fainted. My traveling companion recognised the need for me to lay flat and recoup. He quickly took our untouched meals to the stone faced stewardess to enable me to lay flat and asked for assistance she showed no concern for me whatsoever. When asked for some extra tissues she threw a couple of handtowels my way. We complained to the head steward who apologised and offered us our meals back which we declined. Having flown over with British Airways who were professional on every level it was very clear to me that there was an enormous difference between these similarly fared airlines. I will never fly Malaysian Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-15;PER-KUL-BOM in Economy Class on September 13th. PER-KUL was on an A330-300 and KUL-BOM on the super congested 737-800. The only meal served on the PER-KUL leg was breakfast at 5am (choice of quiche with sausage or rice with shrimp sambal) since the flight had taken off at 1.30am. Perhaps it was automatically assumed that people would've had a nice heavy dinner before boarding the plane. Whilst the food served on the KUL-BOM leg was good (Roti and chicken curry) it was a bit disappointing to know that none of the FA's spoke Hindi which pretty much made it very hard for a few passengers who could not speak or understand English. Overall I think MH's quality seems to have dropped a bit.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-15;13 September. BKK-KUL-LHR on 737-800 and A380. Return trip was considerable better. I sat at 1A on the 737 and although the food was bland the cabin crew managed to top up my glass several times. The KUL lounge was full and seemed relatively pointless given that there were more comfortable seats outside. It was hard to get a drink. After finally getting onto the A380 we had to wait an hour after some confusion over the cargo which meant we missed our slot. The pre-ordered food was great and I had finally worked out that the flat-bed seat of most comfortable when it not quite flat. One of the stewards told me they had recently been modified but was not quite sure how. I managed several hours sleep and awoke to a pleasant breakfast. The cabin crew were polite and efficient. the aircraft was spotless and the toilets big enough for a small party were kept spotless. A far more positive experience than the outward journey.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-15;This airline really should be downgraded from it's current 5 star ranking. I flew them all over Asia out of their KL hub for several weeks. I was shocked to receive an e-mail from them notifying me of a major schedule change and cancellation of one leg from my trip just a few days before leaving! Customer service was mediocre over the phone. No compensation given for this huge hassle which caused a very long layover at KLIA. Food was offered even on short flights but it did not taste very good and wasn't presented well. The service onboard was pretty good and attendants were generally very helpful. Malaysia Airlines is better than most U.S. carriers but it is not in the same league as Singapore Airlines or ANA. I had very high expectations and I was let down.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-13;LAX-KUL-HKT round trip. B777 from LAX was great service food and AVOD. Seats are angle flat and first generation. Bit narrow but comfortable enough for 5 hours sleep on long transpacific legs. B737 service to Phuket was also very good and no problems with crew or plane.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-10;"KUL-ADL 8th September. Morning departure from ADL. Check-in was efficient and well handled by ground staff. Boarding was very well managed by ground staff in Adelaide. Once on board the plane things were different. Cabin crew were just plain disinterested had poor English skills and again there was minimal interaction. Tray tables were dirty video screen was smudged and talk about a sticky in flight magazine pages were stuck together! The food was mediocre this time and before landing a flight attendant went around barking ""seat belts seat belts""! This is a 5 star airline? I think not.";NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-10;Flew from Sydney to London and back 4/9/13 - 9/9/13. A330 and A380. Have to say disappointed in comparison to Emirates and Singapore. Seats seemed small even on A380. Biggest gripe was that it was freezing - on all legs. I did ask why it was so cold and was told I could have an extra blanket. Staff were ok nothing remarkable. No eye shades and I was so sore because of the seats. Entertainment was average. Food ok. It was alright but I'll never book with them again as it was too cold and uncomfortable.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-09;Flew business class Istanbul-Kuala Lumpur in an aged Boeing 777. The seats are not lay flat but angled very hard for me to get any sleep. Service and menu was disappointing. This airline needs to move with the times on long haul the competition is doing a much better job and offering a better product.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-09;LHR-KUL A380. Great check in given exit row seats for long legs. Customer service was non existent like we were an inconvenience. Prodded my wife in the shoulder to get her to put her seat upright. Very little verbal anything and bad English when used. For a flight with 90% westerners I would have expected better. KUL-Phuket on Boeing 737 a shocker. Cabin was filthy spent half the flight planning how I would clean it. Will never fly with this carrier again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-08;7 September. LHR-KUL-BKK on A380 and 737-800. Having flown on a Singapore Airlines A380 on several occasions I was keen to see whether the experience with Malaysia was comparable. I had managed to get a seat in the smaller front cabin. Check-in was efficient. The LHR lounge was pleasant with good service champagne on tap and a great view. Boarding was smooth with a priority line for business passengers. I was fortunate in having an empty seat next to me. The cabin crew were efficient and pleasant. I had pre-ordered my food with Chef-on-Call and the quality was excellent. There were however three problems. The A380 seat although flatbed was simply not comfortable - it seemed as it was raised in the middle slightly and it was not easy to sleep on. Secondly having reserved a seat at the front of business on the 737 I was moved to the back with no explanation given. And thirdly they failed to transfer my bag at KUL and it would be following on a later flight. I will need a lot of convincing to book with Malaysia Airways again.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-08;Jakarta (CGK) to Amsterdam (AMS) via Kuala Lumpur (KUL). It was a long flight. The flight attendants were really nice friendly and helpful. They served delicious food. I really enjoyed the flight. MH offers great in-flight entertainment with plenty of films music and TV channels.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-08;So we're a couple travelling Brisbane to London via Kuala Lumpur currently seated in the Air Malaysia lounge in KL. The first leg is complete and failed to impress. Not only did the breakfast egg option run out before seat row 6 but the coffee was horrendous and twice had sugar added when it was specifically not requested. Although I am trying to be optimistic about the upcoming 13hr leg we have just confirmed that the attendant that checked us in 11hrs ago put us across the aisle from one another! Perfect considering my fiancé is a nervous flyer.;NEGATIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-04;I travel with them at least once a month either in Business or Economy class. Their inflight service attitude is normally above standard and while airline meals are what they are MH catering is tasty and ok for regional flights. What I want to comment on is the appearance of the cabin: on many recent flights I took within the region especially on B737s the cleanliness left a lot to be desired. Any aircraft I boarded had either dirty finger or palm-prints on the overhead lockers. The way they looked it appeared to be from aircraft mechanics as they were oil/grease based prints. Nobody bothered to clean them up. Additionally the aircon vents and even overhead monitors that drop down from the ceilings on B737s all had a huge accumulation of fluff attached to them. It all gives the interior of the planes a shabby look and not representative of a 5 star airline. What prompted me to write this review was a recent domestic flight on Vietnam Airlines where the planes were spotlessly clean and looked all new even when they were not. Malaysia Airlines get it together and clean your planes properly. It is a disgrace for a 5 star airline to be so careless about hygiene.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-04;BKI-KUL on 9 Sep 2013. Fly their new B737-800 sky interior. Had a great experience. Seat was comfortable and have a nice legroom. Crew service as usual professional efficiency and friendly. That flight was full but the crew cabin managed to serve all passenger very smooth and fast. 3 choices of movies. Its ok for me because it just a short-haul flight. Inflight food was delicious. I had chicken. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-03;Flew CDG-KUL in Business on A380. Ground staff were ok but the airport is the worst to fly from in Europe. The lounge which is used by most airlines is not worth going. Once on board things change for the better and the Malaysian Hospitality can be experienced immediately. Staff were very friendly and offered great service. The seat was comfortable and included a comfortable duvet and pillows. The amenity kit from Tumi with Clarins product was very handy and of good quality. I ordered Chef on Call where you can choose a meal before you fly and the quality and presentation was nice. The satay and starter was great. Between meal times you can choose freshly prepared noodle soups freshly baked cookies or fruits. Breakfast was quite nice too and I managed to get some sleep during the flight. IFE was extensive and had a good collection. The A380 is a great aircraft to fly and together with the product Malaysia Airlines offers it is truly a 5 star experience.;POSITIVE
malaysia-airlines;2013-09-01;KUL-ADL on 30th Aug. Ground staff at KLIA are appalling. After security there was only one person at the boarding gate to check boarding passes into the holding area resulting in a very long queue. No consideration given to people with babies and young kids. Boarding was a free for all resulting in congestion once on the aircraft. FA's were efficient but that was all. No smiles no interaction just the bare minimum. Food was good but the portions were small. Since it was a night flight they took too a long time serving the evening meal and that cut down on sleep time in what was a flight of 6 hours and 45 minutes. They would have been better off serving a snack and a drink and then lights off with a more substantial meal before landing. Toilets were clean no announcements from the cockpit crew and AVOD was just mediocre.;NEGATIVE
