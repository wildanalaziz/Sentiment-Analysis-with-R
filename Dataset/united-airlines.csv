united-airlines;2018-09-13;" |  Edinburgh to Charleston via Washington. The flights to Edinburgh were ok but the planes we were on were very old and filthy. I used the warm towel they provide before the meal service to wipe off the center console between the seats and it was black. Yuck! The flight attendants were nice and the food was fine. Our return flights were not good. Our transatlantic flight was cancelled but we were not notified until we were standing in line to check in. We got a nice hotel room amd meals and the flight the next day was on time. But again the plane was filthy, the blanket smelled like body odor and had holes in it, and the wool throw smelled like a wet dog. There is no way those had been cleaned between uses. Again the center console was visibly dirty. I paid almost $5000 for this? The flight attendants were unfriendly and we were made to feel that we were an inconvenience for them. Our connection was in Newark and the plane we were supposed to leave on was diverted to another airport. Flight was delayed for hours while we waited for another plane. That one was United Express and that plane was very old and the interior was not maintained. My husband wents to the lavatory at the back of the plane and said there was a crack in the interior plastic. Part of my armrest was missing. I have to wonder what the state of the mechanics on these aged planes is like if the interior that is visible to the customers is so bad. I will avoid United Airlines whenever possible in the future. Think twice before you book with them.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-12;" |  Lufthansa/United failed to put my luggage on the airplane in Munich, for some unknown reason. Despite filing a claim, my luggage was still sitting in Munich three days later. Eventually, they flew it to Charlotte, NC where I had stayed one night upon my arrival before traveling onwards. I called every night to track the progress (or lack thereof) of my luggage. Even though I had updated the address from the address of the first night's hotel to the new location, every single time I called they had the address of the first night's hotel. Three days after my luggage arrived in Charlotte, I called for the 7th time because I still did not have my bag. They told me it had been dumped off at the hotel where I had stayed 5 nights before, despite the fact that I'd updated the address over and over. So now my luggage is at some hotel I stayed at 5 nights ago that I am not planning to return to. After an hour on the phone with United this evening, he's told me (for the 5th day in a row) that I should have my bag by tomorrow. United is incompetent. Over and over I heard them say, ""I apologize for that, ma'am."" It would seem that they've all be trained to deal with issues in this way, rather than by actually sorting them out. Very, very unhappy with United/Lufthansa and not fly with them again, even if it means paying extra to fly on another airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-11;" |  Denver to Philadelphia. The plane was delayed because of a warning light about a fuel pump after the flight was fully loaded. It then took 20 minutes to get a mechanic and another 20 minutes to figure out the warning didn't matter and we could fly anyway. ""its a redundant system"", they told us. The experience was made worse by the fact that there was no air conditioning during the period of the delay on a hot day in Denver. The airplane was not cleaned after arrival in Denver from San Francisco. I was stepping on crackers left on the floor and there was garbage left in the compartment on the back of the seat. My family flies UA regularly but this had me thinking I should look for alternatives now whenever I can.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-11;" |  Tokyo Narita to Hobbs via Houston. I traveled alone with my 10 month old daughter both ways. No flight attendant helped me out in any way like putting luggage up in the cabin, picking up her toys for me, or even just being friendly. Everyone treated me like I was a hassle to deal with. One attendant refused to give me my bassinet because service had started, even though I had already been waiting for an hour. It only takes a few seconds to latch it on. One flight attendant actually made eye contact with my smiley daughter and waved, which was nice. One Japanese male attendant who I spoke to in Japanese, replied to me in English even though (he was speaking Japanese to the other staff so) I know he spoke Japanese. Why not speak back to me in Japanese? That is just plain rude. Other than that, after experiencing JAL last year, I thought the food was extremely disappointing. I also specifically made a phone call just to request a bassinet, but when I went to check in, there was no such request. I was baffled. I can’t say how disappointed and annoyed I was about the staff on both flights. If you are traveling alone with an infant, they will treat you like an inconvenience.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2018-09-10;" |  After arriving at the airport at 4:30am in San Diego we flew into Chicago. Little did we know we would not be leaving that airport for 36 hours. Our flight to our destination was scheduled to leave at 6pm. After our gate got changed 10 times and our flight got delayed further and further we scurried up and down stairs to each one. We then arrived at the last gate at 9:30pm. We sat and sat and were told no updates. We then were told we were waiting on the plane to arrive that we were flying out. The plane landed. BUT we only have one pilot, so we waited for another plane to land for a second pilot. Thenone of the flight attendants timed out on her shift and could no longer board our flight home. BUT by the time the other plane landed the staff timed out as we watched them walk right out of the gangway to the plane passed us never to be seen again. So, we waited on another plane for a whole new crew. We were assured for the first announcement over the intercom of the night that we were heading out soon! At this point it is 11:30pm. 30 minutes later, at 12am, we are notified that the flight is cancelled. after waiting 9 hours and running around the airport, it is canceled. This is not even the worst of it. We call United customer service to see what can be done 2 times (go ahead and listen to those calls- they are pathetic) only to be told there are no more flights to JAX and that we cannot be helped.  The couple in front of us got another flight booked automatically that left 6am the next day why our customer service experience was so different is beyond me. We ended up buying the only flight we could in a different airport. We ended up purchasing a flight from MDW in Chicago to JAX. Sometime after purchasing the flight I was so relieved to find one! That is until I realized the flight I purchased from Delta airlines was on September 27th when I need to leave ORD right then and there on now what is September fourth. So with even more stress added, I am out over $500 more dollars, I still have no way home, I have nowhere to stay no way to travel, I don’t have my luggage, I am defeated. So, after searching for some more time, there are no flights out of ORD to JAX for 2 more days. I ended up purchasing another flight for $935.60 from a different airline and airport in Chicago that did not leave until 1 pm the next day. We were left with no other choice but the sleep on the ground. So, it is now 1:30am. We are wondering where is my luggage that has everything I need in it and were told our luggage went to JAX already without us. It didn’t make sense. So, we then stood in another line and were told that our luggage is at ORD but if we exit to get it, we cannot get back in until the morning. So, we agreed to get our luggage in the morning before we spend another $40+ dollars to transfer to MDW where our new flight is.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-09;" |  Cedar Rapids to Toronto via Chicago. First delayed flight due to weather, then after boarding there was a plane “malfunction” meaning we would miss our connecting flight. Couldn’t get us anything until the following night missing a day and a half of our trip! Then when trying to see if we could get a partial vs full refund depending if we canceled our trip vs still going they said those seats for the next day were now gone! Forget it what a joke! They were so quick to take my money but didn’t refund me for a checked bag I didn’t even take because of the cancelled trip. Phone customer service was just as terrible saying I had to fill out online for a refund when I told them it kept coming up with an error, sounds like lazy workers to me! Will not fly again!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-09;" | Syracuse to Sacramento via Chicago. Never flying United again. If a representative is taking pain to go through the reviews (which I highly doubt), it’s high time to change your employees. What angered me was not the delays or inconveniences of last minute gate/terminal changes. That I can handle. What irked me was the sheer arrogance and attitude that each one of your employees show towards customers in general-especially the ones at Chicago O’Hare. I am yet to come across one who is civil and decent enough. As customers, we shouldn’t have to deal with your employees attitude and sarcasm. I give this airline zero stars. Nowhere else have I felt this poorly treated ever in my life.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-08; |  San Francisco to Seattle. What a joke of an airline. The staff is rude and unprofessional. The whole experience was so stressful that I have sworn myself never again flying United. I don’t even think they care about customer service. The only nice people are the pilots!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-08; |  Newark to Aruba. United cancelled my flight to give the seats to another group that was cancelled the day. Before then delayed my flight and cost me two whole days in an airport and 2 missed days of work . They offered a laughable 150 compensation to fly with them again. Please read before booking. They are over priced and have no one to speak to in customer service only emails and no phone calls or conversations. I will never fly them again and I suggest you do the same;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  Newark to Raleigh Durham. Flying United once again was a horrible experience. Even though a passing storm stopped several hours before the departure the outbound flight was cancelled. I had to go to a university to attend classes for one week and when I checked in on the rescheduled flight, the flight attendant made me check my luggage even though my luggage basically met the carry on requirement, which caused me to be late to my class though my rescheduled flight left at 6am and I had plenty of time to get to class by 9am. One the way back my flight was delayed 4 hours though only a 1.5 hour flight. Once I got back to my airport, because they made me check my luggage again, I was delayed another hour since the luggage were put into a room without alerting anyone. United airline operates giving zero consideration to the customer's time, paying good money. Their attitude seems to be """"we are doing you a favor"""". The attendants are rude and I have never flown out on time nor reached my destination on time. United new carry on baggage policy is a scam. You have to board basically with nothing with you unless of course you pay more. It is a shame how United treat their customers so poorly and without much dignity.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-08;" | Pittsburgh to Denver. It wasn't enough for United Airlines to make your life hell on the plane, they've overachieved and ruined your day before you even check in! I got to the gate to check in and immediately was informed I was restricted. Yeah thanks for alarming me. Then I'm notified my flight was delayed, but received no notification that this happened. Great, now I'm at the airport 4 hours early. But then it gets worse. I researched the night before and United states you are allowed a personal item and a carry on (sizes are listed) but they don't mention that it depends on the class. If you have basic economy you forgo your free carryon rights and must pay to check it in. Now they've put a damper on my day, trip and wallet. Then my flight was delayed 2 more times just to really kick me in the knees. Bottom line, I would much rather give my nonprofit salary to any other airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-08;" |  San Francisco to Medford . The flight was fine but we paid a lot of money and still had to pay more for baggage and to go on an earlier flight. We also paid to get premium economy so as to have a bit of leg room. The airline check-in was a nightmare. We were coming in from overseas on a different airline and had to re-check bags and get seats. There were kiosks, which I assumed were for checking in bags only. We wanted to try to get an earlier flight so I started to approach the “additional services” counter. However, the attendants started yelling that the counter was only for missed flights. The whole time we were there, the people at the counter were yelling at everyone to use the kiosk. There was no-one there welcoming us and answering questions, they assumed that we should know their process and yelled when we didn’t. After being in the UK and experiencing the polite service there, it was disappointing that one of our major airlines is so rude to customers. Frankly, I would rather fly Southwest where they will be polite to me and won’t “nickle and dime” me like United. Unfortunately, few airlines fly in/out of our little airport.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Wichita to San Francisco via Denver. Horrible delays today without explanation from Wichita to San Francisco. Flight UA2188 from Wichita supposed to fly out at 6:25am, 4 hour unexplained delay. Missed connection in Denver. Flight changed to UA0733 that was also delayed 2 hours unexplained then canceled for flight UA3436 back to Kansas City at 3pm for connecting flight UA5312 to San Francisco which has now been delayed as well. Wide spectrum delays on United flights as a rule, come to find out, especially on the planes from Canada. The planes are old and in disrepair. I will have been bounced around 19 hours and missed a full day of work with expensive parking fees at San Francisco along with now ridiculous drive time. I will never fly United again and will not recommend them. I spoke with another passenger that stated they've been trying to get home for 3 days with United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Newark to Delhi. Miserable employees especially entourage to lengthy nonstop destinations. Seems they should stay and work domestic. Hardly any courtesy or know how to respond to their customers. Maybe they are overworked.

united-airlines;2018-09-05;" |  Paris to Newark. Very friendly staff (except one FA who was a bit cranky, but her colleagues more than made up for it). The food and beverages in business were good. The salads served for lunch and then for the pre-landing snack were fresh and tasty and the pre-arrival snack is a big improvement over the microwaved chicken or mystery meat wrap they used to serve. The seats on the 767-400 are still the old CO/UA BusinessFirst seats. Not bad, but not as comfortable as the new Polaris seats - which at this point you'd start to expect on NYC-western Europe flights, given what the non-US carrier competition now offers. However, we had plenty of pillows and blankets, including a cool gel pillow that was really comfortable. Star Alliance lounge at CDG isn't anything to write home about, but it was fine. The new United Polaris lounge the we used on our outbound flight is a huge improvement over the old United Club.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-04; |  Tampa to Denver. Did not have a seat next to my daughter (she is 14). As I approached the service at the gate they ignored me for about 2 minutes and then told me rudely that they are not open yet. Second time after my trip in July which got me stranded in Denver overnight with no blanket or services or hotel room. I will try to avoid United and will never ever recommend flying United - service got extremely bad over the years.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-04;" |  United Airlines just lost a customer for good! Just finishing off a 2nd leg of a flight. The first leg from New York (LGA) to Houston (IAH) was an incredible 1st class flight with outstanding service. However, my connection from IAH to Lubbock, TX (LBB) was miserable. One would think that a tiny plane at 60% capacity with NO first class section would allow some flexibility, but apparently that’s not the case with UA. I ended up next to another 6’5 male in an already ultra-tight seating arrange (reason #1 I don’t fly United). I quickly felt like the ultimate “commoner” no longer in 1st class when asking to change seats to one of the 3 bulkhead seats with no passenger after the main doors were closed. “Sorry sir, only Gold and Platinum flyers are allowed” is not a comforting feeling after I just spent $1165 on a last minute first class ticket!! If that’s a company policy change it! That’s classless United Airlines. I didn’t request a first class seat. I requested a poor bulkhead with the tightest legroom of any carrier I’ve flown. I think the seat would have cost me $18, but it originally wasn’t available.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-03;" | San Francisco to Seattle. I’m appalled by the horrible attitude from the ground staff in SFO. I was one of the last few to board (with 25 minutes to spare before takeoff), and was told that there was insufficient space overhead bin for the remaining passengers’ bags. I was asked: “Will your bag fit in front of you?” by one of the male staff, to which I answered “Yes, it’s just clothes.” I was then yelled at for no good reason. He said “I didn’t ask you what was in the bag, I asked if it would fit.” I’ve never been treated like this by service crew anywhere in the world. You would think that there would be some semblance of service!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-03; |  San Francisco to Birmingham via Chicago. Never again. Given a flight with an impossible connection. No way to travel over 2 terminals in 10 minutes. Logistics planner that sequences flights sucks as does customer service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-03;" | Flew Orlando to San Francisco. I travel on a regular basis, but not normally on United, Now I understand why! The gate agents, flight attendants and baggage workers are some of the rudist people I've ever met. They seem extremely incompetent and give you the run around if you have a question. I lost my wallet on a plane and it took me over an hour to find someone who could help me. I finally went back to the airport, which was a $60 Uber ride away to figure it out on my own. In addition, my husband was checking a firearm and it literally took 30 minutes to complete after being sent to several different places by several different people. I booked in economy because I didn't read the fine print that talked about the inflexibility of this type of fare. When we inquired about changing, they treated us like we were second hand citizens. Its not like the ticket was free, even if it was, that's no way to treat anyone. Finally, there was a child screaming at the top of his lungs on our flight and not one attendant offered any help to the mother. In addition, they didn't even insist that either of them put on their seatbelts. Unbelievable! Things look pretty in the terminal and everyone is dressed very well, however, the customer service is horrible.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-03;" | I flew on a flight from Tokyo, Narita to Denver international, coming back from a family vacation. Our flight was a total of 10 hours and 10 hours and 20 minutes long. Departing time was 5:15pm - 12:35pm. The flight price was $1,394. I gave it a average of 7 stars, based on the overall stars of 21. I feel the value for money was not where you want it to be. The flight was bearable, but not extremely comforting, there were times where I had to really get creative in the position of my body to get at least 20 minutes of sleep. Leg room was mediocre at best. A passenger sitting next to me who was a little over six foot had 0 space between his knees and the seat in front, he sometimes had to press his foot against the seat in front. Seat Comfort = 2/5 - Value For Money = 2/5 In terms of the cabin crew, they were not nice, but they were not rude either. You could tell some flight attendants were a bit rough around the edges, wanted things to be done quickly. But some were more understanding and nice, but still have that edginess. That is all okay because they ended giving out some decent food. The problem I have with some airlines is that the food is just bland, and this is the same with United, but thankfully, they came with salt and pepper, good job. Dinner meals were okay, but breakfast was great. If your settling in for a long flight, try the omelette meal if they have it, the meal is rather delicious for airplane food. Cabin Staff Crew = 3/5 - Food And Beverages = 4/5. One thing I desperately have to mention is the washrooms in that airplane. I mean I had never seen anything like it. If your a person that frequently visits the washrooms, and does not like to wait, United might not be for you. On my flight, there was not a minute that the washroom was empty. There was also somebody in it, and there was also a lot of waiting, you couldn’t just sit at your seat and wait for someone to finish, because they’re people in line that will snatch that’s opportunity up right away. Man the washrooms on that flight were something I will never forget. My last topic is in-flight entertainment. I felt the roster of movies was pretty good, and I got to watch some very good movies, that are brand new. The only downside is the technology to watch it. It was a touchscreen tv on the seat, but to be honest it was challenging to use, a light press on the screen when you want to exit out will not work at all, and you might be stuck with thinking that your screen isn’t working and not watch a movie for the whole flight! But instead you had to press hard on every single button to get it to work. This is okay and is a lot better than the screen not working at all, but is frustrating. In-Flight Enternainment = 3/5 Well the flight was bearable, an above average flight as you can say, and above average is okay with me on a gruelling 10 hour flight but anything below that is a nightmare. Overall this flight was what you call plain mediocre. And if you have a bit of patience you’ll get though it fine, and if you don’t find another flight. Bearable, Above Average and Mediocre, are things that I feel itchy about, but for a 10 hour flight I would recommend it, but the price is a little bit out of hand.";POSITIVE

They couldn't offer us to go on another flight, they couldn't offer us a pillow or blanket to keep us warm and comfortable while we had to wait.

It's a terrible day for me, due to long weekend we had so many plans and all have been cancelled last minute. My elder daughter is so disheartened.

united-airlines;2018-09-02;" | Hartford to Tampa via Chicago. First let me start by saying if United is your only option for an airline you may want to strongly consider driving to your destination, you will likely get there quicker. Second when your flight is canceled 90 minutes before departure because the aircraft is “not available” United will never tell you why, so do not ever expect any type of compensation for your loss of time or other expenses. Lastly, not only will you ever hear and apology, but instead the agents are rude and act like they are doing you a favor for rebooking causing you to lose an entire day of your time. Never again my friends, and yes please do use my real name! I rarely ever leave poor reviews but this is more than justified!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-09-02;" |  San Francisco to Frankfurt. Worst airline in the world is United Airlines. I'm a gold member for many years. The airlines constantly has flight delay, extremely bad or worst customer services - bad attitude of gate agent, attendants, and all known to everyone the worst food services among all the airlines I've experienced. I fly often with European and Asian airlines, even latin american airlines, all I have received much better services than from United. This is the latest experience I had just 2 days ago traveling from SFO to Reykjavik connecting at Frankfurt. Notified in the morning of departure, flight was delayed for 1 hour 15 min. I have 1 hour 35min connection at Frankfurt originally. Got to airport, the check-in agent said the flight should take off per new time and will arrive only 30min than original. It turned out flight was late departure for 2 hour 15min, and arrived 1 hour 10 min later than planned. And got text message at FRA saying they put me on the flight next day midnight arrival to Iceland. That is 1 and half day later. I only going to be at Iceland for 3 days. Then to make things worse, they couldn't get my baggage transfer to the new flight that I had switched to at FRA airport. Now I'm stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can't get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said ""open to the photo page"". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United's attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn't send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do. They made many phone calls while asking me to wait and took care of everything and handed over my new boarding pass and told me they've notified baggage handling of my new flights.";NEGATIVE

On top of that, the attendant was unsure if we would get a refund if we cancelled the flight. Again, completely unsympathetic.

Every personal detail I entered and gave them such as passport no. DOB, Expiration date and ticket details all matched, but they still didn't let me go through. I'm baffled and wondering as to why didn't United rectified my ticket when I have given them my passport details and all. They took me to the TSA and adding salt to my injury, they kept me waiting for an hour, took me back to United Airlines and asked me to verify her details which the customer service on the phone did, but the United Airlines rep on the desk at the airport refused to verify it. The customer rep on the phone spoke to the rep at the desk and he still refused me to travel back.

My family and I were rerouted because we missed our connecting flight in Chicago when the first flight from Buffalo was almost two hours delayed.

We filed a baggage claim and were told that the luggage was still in Chicago but would arrive on a later flight. Since our connecting flight wouldn't be leaving until the next morning, we waited at the airport and when the last flight arrived around 11pm, still no luggage. We are now left without any luggage and we will be catching our cruise at it's next port of call. This means we will be without a change of clothes and toiletries during a one week cruise. United Airlines has only given us a lot of explanations why they can't help us. The only reason we will even be able to board the boat is because we purchased new tickets through another airline. After the humiliation and frustration that we have been put through by United Airlines, I would never recommend this airline.

Then they informed us because we wouldn't be on the first plane in the flight arrangement they would need to ""cancel"" per policy and charge us additionally to schedule us a new flight, even though we already paid for two seats on a flight that is already leaving from Maui to sf which we would be on. United had ""waived fees"" for flight issues related to the hurricane up until the 26th August, but had no sympathy or sensitivity to the fact that our issue is directly correlated to the waivers they were issuing. Terrible customer service, terrible policies, terrible compassion, and overall I am not surprised with this experience given everything United has received heat for in recent history. I'll never book with them again. I have to believe our experience is part of UA's attempt to fix their stock price, never again.

The flight from the Boston was delayed for more than 5 hours due to thunder storm at Newark and the problem with generator failure at the gate which caused missing of connecting flight to Atlanta. After waiting in queue for 2 hrs at Newark, the boarding pass was issued for 5:40 pm that day(August 11th, Saturday). After the boarding was announced for 5:40 and the gate was opened for crew members, the plane was cancelled. There was already very long queue at consumer service there were no other options than standing in the queue because I was unable to reach customer service via phone. After waiting for line for more than four hours, the situation became very worse due to rude behavior of the customer service representative. She mentioned that next available flight is on Monday morning(August 13th) and there is nothing she can do to help. She also mentioned that hotel accommodation cannot be done as it is weather related although the flight delay from Boston was due to power failure at the gate as well. She convinced me to fly back to Boston next morning(Sunday) and forget about the family vacation or wait at airport until Monday morning. The representative walked away stating that she has other customer to take care of and asking me to make decision to wait until Monday or fly back to Boston on Sunday. It was already past 10 PM and my younger daughter(5yrs) was sleeping on my shoulder. The customer service representative did not came back to the window for more that half and hour and I walked to the next window and requested to talk to the manager. The guy at other window called their team leader who offered option for stand by tickets for next day and spend the night at the airport. I was already tired and hungry and there was no other option than crying or comforting wife and two kids. Spent cold night at cold airport floor. I was not able to get accommodated on 9 am flight on Sunday. I convinced my wife and two kids who where crying after loosing hope of getting flight. Next available flight for stand by was on 11:01 am. There was already about 60 people on standby list and I was flying in a family of four, so the hope of getting boarding pass was very minimum. But it was our luck to get boarding pass for 11:01 plane to Atlanta.

United did not help with any accommodation for a place to sleep in the night for any of their customers. When I checked into a hotel that I was forced to pay for, other people staying at the hotel had vouchers from the Amarican Airlines company because American Airlines cares about where their customers go to sleep at night in the event of a flight change or delay. The day of the flight there was no representative seen at the desk gate D10 from the hours of 7am-10.30am. There was no one there to talk or help any customer until the time of boarding.

My initial flight from Detroit was at 4:45 which was delayed and hence i was rescheduled in another flight at 5:50 pm. I boarded the flight on time, but United Airlines made me to sit inside the flight for 3 hours without taking off and took off at 8:30 pm to Newark, but they diverted to Washing DC and reached DC at 10:45 pm. I missed my connection from Newark which was scheduled to be 8:50 pm. When i landed in Washington DC, i contacted the United Representative who asked me to go Newark in the same flight which is going back to Newark and ask the Representative over there. So i have to wait to go to Newark to ask about my options. In the meantime, United didnt offer any food or water as it is 11 pm and none of the shops are open at DC and I didnt have any food after lunch. I boarded the flight in DC to Newark at 11:30 pm and again we were made to sit inside the airplane for another 2 hours before take off and reached Newark at 3:30 am (next day). I have to wait in line for 3 hours to speak to United Airline customer representative and took more than one hour to reschedule to another flight which i have to tell them what flights are available by looking from my personal phone. By the time i completed the process, it is 7:30 am and my reschedule flight is at 2:15 pm from Newark. I had 7 hours and United Airlines said wait in the airport to take the next flight which is through Air India. United never offered any accommodations or food and never ever thought about their customer. I waited in the airport and reached India the next day, but found out my bag didnt reach. When i contacted Air India which was the carrier which brought me to India, AirIndia mentioned that United Airlines never handed over the bags to them. Its been 2 days after i reach and yet to receive my bags and AirIndia told me United is yet to give the bags. Don't travel through United Airlines, as this is my second worst experience with United Airlines. Exactly three years ago, i flew through United from Washington DC to Frankfurt and United made to sit in the flight for 6 hours without taking off and asked us to get out of the flight after 6 hours of delay stating they have technical issues. At that time, i decided never to take United, but this time Lufthansa asked me to take United as part of their alliance as Lufthansa flight are booked for certain dates. I was assuming that United Airlines would have changed in the last three years and would be better. To my assumption, they have changed, but worse than the previous time. Atleast last time when the issue happened, United provided accommodations and food, but this time they didn't care about any of the customers and didn't even worry about anything about their customer.

The weather could not have been more picure perfect in London and same was the case in EWR. Upon probing the customer care, they admitted that it was mechanical failure. The reason they say weather is that then they are off the hook. They could only find flight to fly the following day. Now I went from direct flight to connection through Frankfurt. I had to spend one additional day in hotel, food, clothing all purchased at my cost. Unfortunately, my flight next day was also delayed. The guys in Lufthansa said that my connection in Frankfurt was fine. I missed the connection. Now I contacted United. They said it was not their issue anymore and I have to deal with Lufthansa. Lufthansa put me now through Denmark. Fine print: My flight from Denmark to EWR was standby and Lufthansa said that it was confirmed. We go to Copenhagen to find this hard truth. Called United and as expected they passed the buck to Lufthansa who passed the buck to SAS and who in turned passed it to United. With great difficulty my family and I made it back to USA, The SAS flight was horrible. Old plane, poor service, charge for even a soda. Horrible! I came back and filed a complaint with United. They make their feedback site so restrictive that you cannot explain details or upload bills properly. They dont even have a contact number to follow up. When I didnt hear back from United and called Mileageplus service, they basically said that wait your turn and we will call you when we get to it. What arrogance and callousness.

They were not ready to give out baggage to passengers for whom flying the next day was not an option... again because their crew had gone home. It almost felt like their crew had to rush home once the clock struck a certain hour otherwise they would turn into pumpkins like in the Cinderella story!

They took 30 minutes to get us off the plane (again), they took twice that to get our bags off of the flight, and they finally lost one of our bags and put it on another flight.

Whatever expectations I did have on United's long-haul product were exceeded. Due to the fact that it was a flight to the United States, we had to go through additional security checks and ""recheck-in"" at a United service counter. It was a quick and efficient process. Our flight departed Heathrow thirty minutes past the scheduled time. The flight was nearly full, and I had a window seat on this flight. The seat configuration on the 787 was a 3-3-3. Once in the air, a refreshments service occurred, which was followed by lunch. There were two options: chicken or pasta. I opted for the pasta, and it was pretty decent. It came with some sort of grain and corn salad, as well as a bread roll, butter, cheese and crackers. It was a good portion of food. The United Economy seat was very comfortable with heaps of legroom by economy standards. It is made of leather and reclines relatively far back. The inflight entertainment was outstanding, with plenty of choices and a very modern and responsive touchscreen. The seat was also fully wired with a headphone jack, a USB port and a power outlet below the seat. In addition, I would definitely recommend flying on the 787 because the windows are much larger and darken at the touch of a button. The inflight service was okay, not up to par with Lufthansa or Austrian. Although it was a day flight, I got four hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow provided, both very comfortable. Before arrival we were served a warm turkey sandwich, as well as fresh fruit, chips and a cookie. All of it was delicious, especially the fruit, which was a nice touch. We landed in Los Angeles 18 minutes before scheduled arrival. Overall, United's hard product (the seat and entertainment) are outstanding, however their service needs a little work. I would recommend United Airlines and I certainly look forward to flying them again.";POSITIVE

I have had multiple occasions of delayed flights, sleeping in airports, damaged and lost luggage (steel reinforced cases may I add that still get smashed), rude customer service agents, missold upgrades and rude flight attendants. I have been offered a $400 voucher in compensation of all of these however when I tried to use it, they said it's not valid for anything other than booking new flights. So my existing flights that are booked months in advance, I cannot use this on. Naturally, I don't want to fly again with United so the compensation is useless.

united-airlines;2018-08-13; |  Worst flying experience I’ve ever had. Our first flight was delayed so we had to completely reschedule all our connecting flights. We made it to Houston to wait for our next flight and after waiting 2 hours our flight was delayed another 3 hours. After 8 delays/times changes for our flight and 7 hours of sitting in the airport all they did to help us was give us a $10 voucher. We asked about the delays to try to figure out what was going on and see if there was another option. We were responded to very rudely and disrespectfully any time a question was asked and were not given any sort of response besides “can’t help you”. I will never be flying United again.;NEGATIVE

My flight back to San Francisco also was delayed by an hour because it has arrived from Denver, CO later than expected. I heard that's because the original plane got broken and United had to replace it. This seems to be a pattern. There should be some serious systemic problems killing United and there is no evidence the United management cares about it. On the other hand, United customer service reps were helpful and crews on both planes were nice. Overall, I now regret that several years ago I got a Chase United credit card and made United my default choice for air travel. In the retrospect, it was not a wise decision.";NEGATIVE

They boarded the passengers on the plane and were getting ready to depart. Over the intercom the flight attendant said “The captain had a family emergency so we are getting a new one and he will be here in an hour and a half”. Ok, pretty normal stuff happens right? We come back an hour later, sit at our gate, and we hear the person say “Um, there seems to be a sudden maintenance issue that may take several hours” It was 2:04pm when they said that and I boarded at 6:25pm. Thats 5 hours (including waiting for the pilot). Do not fly united, they are terrible.";NEGATIVE

Then they started boarding, since I was very tired a fall asleep, I woke up over an hour latter when people were getting out of the plane, I thought we arrived to Chicago. But no the plane moved to another gate and that’s it. We had a delay of 12 hours. I could drive for less money and headache. I would not recommend United if time is really important to you.";NEGATIVE

When my flight was delayed from 10:50pm to 6:30am because the pilot decided to not show up, i tried to get help from the person at the front desk and he told me he couldn’t help because he was “off work and not getting paid for this.” Then, we were not given hotel accommodations because we were “local” even though I live an hour away. Now, on the flight that has already been delayed by 8 hours we are still sitting on the tarmac waiting for the first officer who didn’t account for the fact that there was going to be traffic. I cannot explain the amount of frustration I have, because I think there is a way to handle these type of situations, and United absolutely does not know how to do it. I’ve never experienced such disrespect from customer service representatives, or such a lack of compensation for their actions. Will not be flying with united ever again.";NEGATIVE

This was my second time flying with United, the first times was a disaster, missed connecting flight due to incompetent TSA, then the new flight was delayed 4 times, i swore never to fly with them again but 3 years later i decided to give it another shot. Once again they validated their incompetence by messing up my tickets. They checked my 9 yr old in as an infant causing massive confusion, back and forth trips to different attendants, leading to the missing of our flight. They rebook us onto the next flight only to have us miss that as well because surprise! They gave us the wrong tickets again. Absolutely awful customer service. Only 2 times i have flown this airline and both times they have ruined my flights and made no attempt to accommodate us for the massive inconvenience. Never ever will i be foolish enough to purchase from United again.";NEGATIVE

But our flight was delayed 3 hours - and the plane itself was sitting in the port the entire time but they waited to fill the fuel up just as we were boarding. delaying us even further. When questioned on alternative options/compensation in any form for the inconvenience we were ignored. They have horrible customer service - attitudes from every United employee within the airport itself. I would never voluntarily choose United for future travel.;NEGATIVE

At the day of my flight, I went to the airport and I surprised that there is a special line for New York travelers, then I knew that the airplane got cancelled! Without even knowing then I tried to find different route because it is a board exam and I won’t be able to postpone it. And after plenty of begging I was able to change my routes to SF then to NY. Both flights got delayed and we still don’t know the reason! Finally, today I’m going back to Sacramento, and now I’m at the airport and received a text message telling me that the plane got delayed 1 hr and 30 min!

My flight started with the announcement that the flight is over-booked and so someone had to leave, they offered $450, a flight next morning in first class and a hotel for the night. I didnt take it. I had boarding group 5 but somehow managed to board the plane first. Seats were actually better than at most of translantic flight, legroom was fine, width wasn't that bad too. Entertaiment screens was however just ads, so the only way to watch movies was to download the United app and then watch, but there was big selection of movies so actually a good entertaiment system, food was for purchase, drinks were free. The crew was nice too. We departed at time, and arrived earlier, we only waited 10 minutes on tarmac. I dont understand why is United so hated. I had an excellent experience.";POSITIVE

The flight attendants became out of legal hours - didn’t they know they are delaying the the flight over and over. They put us in line for hotel vouchers, a 3 hours line to get our vouchers, this is a true torture- the flight was suppose to leave 6 hours ago- it is now almost 2 pm. Everyone is exhausted and they don’t have enough stuff to put us in the hotel. Stay away from this unprofessional outfit. I’ll never use them again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-08-06;" |  United delayed my flight by 3 hours and so I attempted to change my flight to an earlier departure as I had urgent business in NYC. After speaking to three different representatives on the phone who refused to help me, the manager of the supervisor of the original staff member I spoke to put me on an earlier flight and told me I was good to go. After arriving at my new gate, the O'Hare employee at the gate informed that I was never checked-in so I didn't have a seat on the plane and that I might not make it out. That flight was then cancelled, and my checked bag eventually flew to LaGuardia on my original flight and instead of offering to deliver it to my house, United insisted that I come back to the airport in two days to pick it up. Long story short, the customer service provided by this airline is terrible, I'm never flying them again and I can tell you if you're ever in need of help this airline will do absolutely nothing for you.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-08-05;" |  Los Angeles  to Honolulu. This wasn't the best flight I've taken. The seats were very uncomfortable and felt super hard leather. There was no exact entertainment system so instead you had to put your phone or ipad inside the holder which I didn't have with me. They didn't have that much stuff for breakfast. The United Wi-Fi was super expensive : $11 for 1 hour, $15 for 2 hours, $21 for full flight. They only offered one website free which was unitedwifi.com where for free you could stream a limited number of movies for free without being able to access the rest of the internet. I didn't have headphones so that didn't work out. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-08-04;" |  This flight was a ""United by SkyWest"" Flight From Boise, Idaho to San Francisco and then to Fresno California. The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem ""Only effecting Skywest flights"" and that the plane couldn't, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn't do anything, but don't worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to ""Time Out:"" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that ""The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork."" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that ""If You are going to get off Plane do so Now."" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, ""It should be about 20 minutes"". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane. We eventually take off and arrive in Fresno 5 hours late.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-08-01; |  Houston to Saint Louis. No notification of delays. Delays for over 2 hrs. Zero customer service. Never will use again. Cheapest and poorest run airline I have ever flown. I wish I could change but not even given an option.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-08-01; |  United lost my luggage on my flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Upon arrival at SFO they told us they have found the luggage at LAX and that they will deliver it in the evening since they have a flight every hour. After we went to our house we checked with the automated messaging system and that we get a message saying that it is out for delivery. We were waiting for the whole night since it had very important item in it but with no avail. Finally we contacted the agents but they did not have any communication with their drivers to tell us the ETA. On our earlier flight from SFO to LAX they lost 9 out of 10 luggage. We received those luggages three days later at our vacation destination. We had to endure those three important vacation days without required medication and daily requirement needs in our vacation. Of course no compensation for all those pain and inconvenience at all. In my view United is in-efficient with bad management to cause me this kind of inconvenience and pain for being it's customer. I would not recommend it for anyone unless this is the only airline that is left in the world.;NEGATIVE

Our flights from Montréal to Dulles and from Dulles to Cancun were OK, no more no less, had to pay for anything more than drinks. Staff wasn't particularly nice, nor rude, just doing their job. The way back, though. Another story. The flight from Cancun to Dulles was juste a few minutes late, no big deal. Pilot put the pedal to the metal and we were actually there in advance. Then our flight to Montreal was delayed. By 30 min, then 1 hour, then 2 hours, 2 and a half... Next thing we know, it is past midnight and our flight is cancelled. We waited at the ticket counter for 20 min to be transfered on another flight, only to finally have them tell us that they're re-switching us back on the same flight that they decided last minute to postpone to the following morning. Caused all kinds of problems at check-in after we spent the night at the airport hotel, since they gave the flight a different number. Needless to say the plane was 20 min late the following day. Never flying United again. Lost 8 hours of work because of their disorganization.";NEGATIVE

In fact, I don't think it was any roomier than any of the other seats. The interior of the aircraft itself was tattered and worn. The flight attendant was very nice and professional, but her appearance could have been a bit more polished. I realize this is 2018 and working as a flight attendant isn't a beauty contest, but certainly there's a professional and corporate image to uphold, even at United.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2018-07-30;" |  Dublin to Raleigh via Newark. I have never left a review for an airline in 30 years of travel (first time for everything). Our flight experience yesterday was pretty bad, and after dealing with the customer service today, I feel the need to write this. First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.  No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.  It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. It’s not the poor man’s fault, sometimes it’s just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of United’s control happening, and today finally made me realize it’s just terrible customer service.  I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.  No desire to travel on this airline again. I’m flustered so I’m sure there are typos. Great trip where I got engaged and ended on a bad note. Now we need to buy a bunch of items just so we can go to work tomorrow morning.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-07-30;" | United must be trying to coerce Basic Economy buyers to upgrade by treating you like complete garbage. One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we've had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn't work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads ""Economy"", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk ""Basic Economy"" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says ""it goes over there"". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), ""License and boarding pass!"" No ""hello"", no ""how are you"", not even a complete sentence, and they weren't even very busy so it surely couldn't have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United's fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers. To conclude, making United staff do any extra work is a crime so steer clear of United Airlines.";NEGATIVE

Our flight between Newark and San Juan my parents and I had paid extra ($75USD each) to pick our seats by getting economy plus. Upon checking in online, we discovered that they gave up our seats, and now we no longer had seats. We then called to get our seats back. This did not happen. They instead gave us seats close to each other. Okay fine... BUT when arriving to the airport we go to print our boarding passes and again discover that we DO NOT have seats! So we have been told on the phone to settle things at the Toronto airport, then we were told to settle things at the Newark airport, and finally we were told that they can’t do anything. Why did we spend about $250USD just to get shuffled around? Stop charging people for services that you are not providing. That is a scam, plain and simple. You said that it happens when aircrafts shift, but that’s your problem. I paid for this service and expect to get seats without the hassle that we have been through.";NEGATIVE

I find it hard to believe that an airline as large as this does not have sufficient crew members and back up teams. On top of everything the waiting area gate only has enough seats for 20 or so people, United decided to rip out the rest and replace them with useless iPads for gambling, so most people have been standing or sitting on the floor waiting for updates.

No explanation offered. Absolutely horrible customer service at the counter.

Well, $200 change fee plus an additional $200 for a different day fare. Supervisor said “sorry nothing we can do”.

Gate agents can’t provide any information on why we aren’t boarding, I was told they were making an engine repair, another woman was told they were replacing a windshield wiper. After more than 4 hours of being held hostage at the gate, we are finally provided with water. After six hours we are allowed to board. We taxi to the runway and are told we are 3rd in line for take off. Then the pilot announces they’ve exceeded ground hours and we are returning to the airport. Not a gate, but a small door. United has no gate at VCE, no United employees either. Baggage is delayed for about an hour, another hour in line for hotel voucher, another hour ride to the hotel, finally eat food at 9:30 pm. Back on the bus at 5:30am. Long day, tired, hungry, upset, no explanations. Not a good way to end a nice vacation. United offered no compensation other than the 600 euro as required by law.

Then, I went on a trip from July 12-24 to Aruba, United cancelled out flight from Houston to Aruba and we had to fly all the way up to Newark, NJ and spend the night in the freezing cold airport in order to get to Aruba on time for our house check in. There is hardly any leg room, the workers are rude and very unhelpful! On the trip back we had to fly to Miami, we had to collect and recheck and repay for our luggage! $200 worth! Then, even though we had just carried on a bag and a personal item, we were told we couldn't on the next flight because we were group 9! Seriously? Thankfully we had a better airline from Houston home! Then, when I got home I checked the status of my refund only to find that they ""can't refund my ticket"" so now I am out almost $400 and they will be making money on the seat that I cancelled!

I was upset about my lost luggage and when I entered Bangor a United employee told me to “change my tone or she would call the cops”. This is after I almost missed the second plane because there first one was yet again late.

After waiting in the airport for 11 hours because it was the only available flight, I had another delay in Newark. I called to try to receive compensation and was told it probably wouldn’t happen because it was weather related, yet the last plane was not delayed due to weather. I was told to file online and I have and still have not heard back.

The padding was super thin, the headrests flopped over whenever you brushed against them, and the recline was non-existent in economy. A lengthy delay to start my trip didn't help, but that could have happened on any airline so I won't knock United too much on this. I fly from NY to San Francisco a lot for work on American, their economy seats are like first class compared to these United seats. My United aircraft had the new Polaris design with smaller seats, it should be banned. The meals onboard were fine, for my son. I was jealous of his kids meal, dinosaur chicken nuggets and veggies. The adult meals, people were asking flight attendents what was in them, and the flight attendants didn't know. It was either ""chicken"", ""veggie"", or ""pasta"". If a flight attendant can't tell you what's in a meal, would you want to eat it? Seatback entertainment was above average, they had a good selection of TV and movies. And it worked well. I'm not flying United ever again. Maybe for a short flight, but not for an overseas or transcontinental flight. M";NEGATIVE

So i go to customer service, only for the lady to tell me my only options are to be on standby for a flight being that in the event a person don't show, I get to go home ? I paid about $500 for a flight that usually costs $120 only to be told the airline won't be doing what I payed them to do, their job. Instead I get a ""sorry about that "", maybe 24hrs from now I'll get to go home! So I'm stuck in the airport until then, while I'm offered no compensation for wasting my time, being stranded, or causing me to have to call in to my job because the airline has failed me as a customer. Overall I'm still stuck and the airline hasn't taken responsibility for not doing their part as a business. My experience is ruined with this airline.";NEGATIVE

Tried to book for a later flight, and the agent said he would oblige, but gave me a boarding pass for the next day, again without offering any explanation as to why. As a result of this debacle, I wound up having to pay for a hotel room that I did not use, and I had to cancel a meeting scheduled the following morning.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-07-25;" |  My wife and I are in our mid-60s and have flown extensively both on national and international flights, but our experience over the past two days with United Airlines is the worst flying experience we have ever had from an airlines. First, our flight on Monday from Geneva to Newark was problematic and when we landed we received a cell phone apology and told that we could receive a ""token"" concrete apology if we went online (no thanks). At Newark our direct flight to Milwaukee was first delayed two hours due to the crew not yet arriving and then it was cancelled entirely. UA first told us that we would not be able to fly out until Wednesday evening, two days later than our schedule and they would not pay for any hotel accommodations! There was a United flight to Milwaukee within the next two hours but it was full. When we again asked about flights to other airports they told us we could fly to Minneapolis, stay overnight at our own expense, and then fly to Chicago on Tuesday and then from Chicago to Milwaukee later that day. When we asked UA to pay for a Minneapolis hotel (they cancelled the flight!) the UA rep said that the cancellation was due to an ""air traffic control situation"" so UA wasn't going to do squat for us. We took the Minneapolis flight and the UA rep said our luggage would be put on that plane but when we arrived in Minneapolis the UA rep there told us our luggage was sent to Milwaukee! So no change of clothes or toiletries, just what we had in our carry on. The UA baggage chief in Minneapolis was curt and dismissive, and couldn't have cared less about us. We are now sitting in the Minneapolis Airport at 5 AM (and 4 hours of sleep in the hotel) after being in transit for 36 hours from Geneva, and can only wonder what is in store for us on the next two legs of our trip home. We have never experienced such poor service and no interest in customer care when foul ups occur on the airline's side. Avoid United Airlines! Our expenses are certainly piling up due to UA's actions (and non actions).";NEGATIVE

They have no backup plan, no rooms available, no new flights to get you home, can't find your luggage. Last time I ever consider this want to be airline line for anything. Happens every time I fly them. I didn't book this flight so let it happen, and now I pay for room, rental car, meals, day late home and they really don't care about anybody in the 3 customer service lines that are hundreds of yards long. Beware the difference between them and any other airline. Fly at your own risk and take a lot of extra money.";NEGATIVE

The Bangkok check-in agent failed to tag my second bag so it did not arrive in Seattle. I notified UA baggage services in Seattle and was told (very rudely) that because I didn’t have the claim ticket it wasn’t their fault but they would help anyway, which consisted of the agent logging my lost baggage in their “system” and washing their hands of it. The baggage agent in Seattle was shockingly rude and uncaring. Figuring that was the last I would hear from UA on this matter, I phoned ANA’s US reservation number and found someone who immediately took it upon herself to find a supervisor who called the Bangkok station manager. They found my bag and routed it to SeaTac airport on the next flight. I’m here picking up my bag, yet the UA bag tracking website and call center are still assuring me that, while My bag has not been found, they are attempting to locate it. I also just spoke to the same rude UA baggage agent, who rudely assured me again they are doing everything they can to locate my bag. What startling incompetence - it’s a wonder UA can keep the airplanes serviced and in the air. Thanks for nothing, United.";NEGATIVE

United automatically rebooked me on the 1850 flight. The 1850 was delayed until 2305 on account of a late incoming aircraft. Understandable due to the bad weather but communication by United was bad. Departure time kept changing. I tracked the incoming flight and it showed 2138 arrival yet United showed the departure time as 2045 hrs which was misleading. Asked if my bags would be loaded onto the later flight and was told yes. They sent a “move message” to ensure my bags would make the later flight. Finally landed in Seattle 6.5 hours late and to add insult to injury, both my bags didn’t make it. Here’s where the real problem began. United didn’t call me even once. Their toll free number and websites gave no information. The only way I could get any information wAs by going to the airport to speak to an agent. Finally got my bags 48 hours after checking them in. Miserable, horrible experience which I would not care to ever repeat.";NEGATIVE

They do not allow disabled people to board first, nor if you have a child over 2. The seats have arm holders that do not lift up so with a small child who is scared or a person who is larger and needs more space, it’s not an option. You have to pay for carry-ons and pay to pick your seat, in addition to your ticket. So awful. One agent even threatened to refuse a woman on the plan for the size of her purse. As a disabled woman traveling with a child, I’m extremely dissatisfied. There were several great agents before we got to our gate which is the only reason this rating is not 0.";NEGATIVE

The airport is a small local regional airport that decided to schedule 3 flights within a 20 min period with 1 line of TSA agents checking people in. Needless to say, United airlines left 20+ passengers behind on a flight with 50 seats total. American Airlines also had 2 flights taking off within this period but delayed the flights to ensure that all their passengers made it onto their flights. My checked bag also left without me, and will be sitting unattended in Okinawa for at least 24 hours while I’m stuck here in the United States. Needless to say, I will never fly United Airlines again even if they offered free flights. ";NEGATIVE

My husband was bruised on his foot by the lack of room in the seats. The bathrooms were locked for the first hour while the inept crew attended a woman with a seizure probably due to the excessive heat in the cabin. Another woman threw up and there was no cart service for the first half of the trip. When I spoke to the crew about the heat that was so bad most people were spillled over into the aisle as the seats were suffocating. I was told to turn on my air vent which was fully open. Duh! We were instructed to only use the bathroom in our assigned cabin, once they were finally open. The access to the bathroom was obstructed by the stretched out legs of the 7 ft man who should never been moved to the last row where the seat room is mallet due to airline design and lack of reclining seats although the row in front reclines into thenpassengers face";NEGATIVE

We've been stuck without any clothes or hotel and they basically wash their hands and blame it on the airlines. I used them once before and spent over $15K with them and more of the same.

After everyone was seated and thought we were finally leaving we were told the plane needed 20 minutes to fuel. An hour later we were told there was another delay because commissary hadn't delivered yet. At that point passengers raised objections to the delay while flight attendants laughed at us.

At 64 years old its not an experience I wish to have again and not a nice start to our holiday. But this is nothing compared to the ignorant, arrogant and rushed manner that we were treated to all the way back to Australia on the return flight by a crew that treated everyone as if we should sit back say nothing and dont dare interfere with their time.

Now we setup for 6:45 pm and we dont really know if we are going to meet our vacation deadline since we already missed the day. Some customer service are doing their job but some think their doing it free.

united-airlines;2018-07-18;" | We were very disappointed in United Airlines! When we got to our gate at Salt Lake airport at 4pm there were travelers that had been waiting since 9am due to aircraft maintenance, (a hydraulic seal). It didn't delay our flight but put a bad taste in our mouth right from the beginning. The customer service on ground and in the air was just OK. After we boarded all the TV screens were flashing DirecTV propaganda. Saying to swipe your card now and then later saying it was $5.99 for flights under 2.5 hours and $7.99 for flights over 2.5 hours. But they offered a *very generous* discount of $2 each if you swipe the same card on 3 or more screens. They advertise that they have free wifi though! So we connected and downloaded their app with no problem. But after selecting a movie and pressing watch, it makes you enable airplane mode in case of a connection interruption. But after doing so and pressing watch again, it says it can't connect, the same thing happened on our return flight. Which I'm sure forces or tricks people into paying for the DirecTV, which was very glitchy and the sound quality was terrible. So I'm glad we didn't end up paying for that. We landed 10 minutes late and our connecting flight was on the other side of O'Hare and we had 15-20 minutes to get there. We got to the gate with 5 minutes to spare after running the whole way. On our return flight, there were tons of people in the gate room waiting because of another aircraft maintenance delay. This caused us to have to move gates which wasn't a huge deal but still annoying. Our flight was also delayed about 30 minutes. When we boarded the cabin it was very hot and stuffy and barely went away by the end of the flight. We were miserable the whole time. Needless to say their airplanes are not properly maintained and are way out of date, (they still had an ashtray in the bathroom). Compared to Delta, United couldn't be worse. Even Southwest and Frontier are better. 10 or 20 years ago all of this might not have even mattered. Can we say misappropriation of funds? In short, we will never be flying United Airlines ever again.";NEGATIVE

Disappointment after disappointment. Long story short things change and I ended up needing to change the time of my flight. Their policy is a 200 dollar change fee which was just as much as the ticket. I even purchased the misleading insurance just in case this might happen and they ONLY cover it if the airline changes or cancels... useless. Other airlines including southwest and jet blue have change fees as low as 60 and some free! So apparently they have a better handle on how to accommodate their flyers. Then I get to the airport and your only allowed one personal shoulder bag or purse, no carry on. I had the tiniest purse and had to check my 15 pound carry on. I didn’t know Airlines don’t allow carry ons these days. (I purchased the basic ticket which was not that much cheaper than other airlines. Had I known this I would have paid more for the ticket with another airline and wouldn’t have to pay for a checked bag)I did not plan to check it and was supposed to change clothes for my destination to fit my busy schedule so was unable to do so. Much less value than other airlines with similar prices. No commitment to the customer experience, old unaccommodating policies and less value. I will absolutely not be flying United again since there is no reason to when I have multiple better choices. ";NEGATIVE

I have gone through a lot in the last 5 years. Travel has been very scarce. I booked a 2 week trip overseas. My mistake was to let the touring company book the air for me and my second mistake was letting them choose United. They gave only a 45 minute wait between my 2nd and 3rd flight and the plane left over an hour late. Strike 1. My final flight of the day was with Lufthansa. Fortunately Lufthansa got me on another flight but I had to wait 7 hours in an airport. Thank you Lufthansa. Strike 2 United. Coming home from my trip the touring company booked me a 5 hour layover in San Francisco. I already had 24 hours of real traveling time scheduled. After 3 different gate changes in San Francisco they finally said they were having plane maintenance issues. An 8:00 pm flight has now been moved to 10:20 pm at yet another gate. The time I'm leaving this flight is later than my scheduled arrival! United Airlines cannot be trusted to take their passengers to their desired destination in a timely manner. For domestic flights I will now go with Southwest and for international I will go with Delta or Lufthansa.;NEGATIVE

I didn't have to go through security at Frankfurt and after visiting the Lufthansa Star Alliance Lounge I walked to the boarding area. When I showed my boarding pass I was told that I needed to go to Document Check. I then got back in line and there was another problem so I went to the counter. I was told to go back to the end of the line and try again. I'm Group 1 so I wasn't happy about that. The third try I still could not get in through the gate. I was told that because I had an exit row seat I had to go through a different entrance. Good Grief. United is the only airline that I know of that seats 10 across in Premium Economy on a 777-300. The seats are tight with a 17 inch width. About 35 minutes after take-off, they turned the fasten seatbelt sign off. First came a bag of bread sticks, then came a small bottle of water, then came my food with plastic tableware and then the beverage cart with a complementary glass of wine or a beer. There was no hot or moist towel. After all food items were picked up, they came by with another glass of wine or beverage. The fasten seatbelt sign came on several times during the flight because of a very light chop. United has changed the recorded announcement to ""Please fasten your seatbelt."" The German speaking flight attendant had a very loud voice which would have made sleeping difficult, but in the economy cabin, they never turned off the lights or asked people to close their window shades so it was impossible for me to sleep. Prepare for landing, which means the fasten seatbelt sign is on and seats need to be upright was 50 minutes before landing, which makes for a long 50 minutes. When flying to Europe, I would recommend Lufthansa. On my flight a month earlier to Europe, Lufthansa turned off the fasten seatbelt sign seven minutes after take-off and it wasn't turned back on until 25 minutes to landing, a very quiet flight.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2018-07-12;" |  Atlanta to San Francisco. One of the most inconsiderate customer service experiences that I’ve ever had before with United Airlines! My family and I booked a one way flight from Atlanta to Reno, NV where we were catching a connecting flight in San Francisco on 7/10/18. After boarding the flight in Atlanta at 7:35a, we sat in our designated seats for nearly an hour due to mechanical difficulties that they were having with the plane. When nearing San Francisco, the pilot and his flight attendants informed us that we were behind schedule by 25 minutes but he had informed the supervisor of our late arrival due to multiple passengers with tight connecting flights that were boarding while we were still in flight. Our flight landed at 10:17am. Due to the pilot landing at the wrong gate, we sat on the plane an additional 10 minutes before they finally allowed us to exit which was approximately 10:25a. Our connecting flight also with United Airlines allowed passengers to board between 10:15a and stopped boarding at 10:25a. Again, we were under the impression that our flight was being held for us. Upon approaching the gate, the 2 people at the gate and customer service desk were the absolute rudest and the most inconsiderate. They stated that they never got word from the pilot about our late arrival. They attempted to split my family (my husband, myself, and our 7yo son) apart to catch different flights then recanted and stated that they were full. Our son is competing in the USA National Karate Competition in Reno, NV and had to be checked in by 4pm. We explained that to them. Still no remorse or apology or anything. Instead, they attempted to book us for a 9:30p flight which we refused. The only thing left for us to do as parents was to rent a car and tackle the 4hr drive! Of course the rental was over priced because it was last minute and being dropped off in a different state! This whole experience was absolutely horrible! ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-07-11;" |  My last experience with UA was just utterly gross. I sat in economy on the way from Chicago to Maui (9 hour flight) with no inflight entertainment, they do offer WiFi that you have to pay 35 bucks for if you want to use your computer and they offer a movie streaming service which you can use in your own personal device (you can’t use this on your phone unless you have the United airlines app which you can download but you’d have to do it before your flight because on the flight you have to pay the internet in order to download it from the App Store. For your computer, you have to install certain softwares in order to stream them from your laptop. They offer food that they charge you for because it’s the passengers responsibility if they get hungry on a 9 hour flight apparently. The seat was tiny with the smallest amount of leg room you can imagine. Luckily I sat in the aisle seat so I was able to stretch my legs out into the aisle from time to time but if I kept my legs out for to long: a flight attendant would walk by having no promo em stepping on you or “inadvertently” kicking you as they walk through without any contrition. The flight attendant (I dread calling them that because they seldomly attended) would make her way down the aisle with a tray of coffee or tea, run out by the time she got to row 10 and never attend to the people passed that point. Finally when she did make it to me with her cart (which was 15 minutes before landing) I asked if I could get a coffee and cranberry juice and she snarled at me with the response “ok I really have to keep it moving”. Overhead compartments was so small and people were playing a really tricky game of Tetris to make their stuff fit in. The electrical outlet was humongous so my charger for phone and computer kept falling out and the only way I could charge is if I physically held the charger in the outlet. The food that I ended up paying for was gross and cold and the bread was stale and difficult to chew. They put up a sheer curtain between first class and economy so that you’re teased by the huge personal TVs and vast space they have. Clearly a ploy so that you only buy first class tickets since the alternative is physically painful. The bathrooms had toilet paper all over the floor (clearly no one tends to them during the flight). The call lights I would press for the flight “attendant” were just promptly turned off without anyone swinging by to see if there was anything that I needed. Honestly, so many more issues to list, it was mortifying flying with UA and I really do not know how they are still in business when you compare thEm to other American airlines";NEGATIVE

The boarding counter lady was super nice and was really worried about getting us in first of all after the business class got in the plane. In the plane the flight attendants offered us every help possible and kept asking if my son is doing okay throughout. The lady attendant also brought my son a banana and some delicious chocolates, probably from the business class menu items. When we finally reached the destination not only we promptly received our son's wheelchair but also another special need helper was there with my sons name on an iPad displayed to guide us our way to the luggage carousel.

And just when I thought I might finally be able to go home, that flight was delayed three hours too. When we finally got on the plane it took another hour to actually take off! I missed all my plans for the day at home because I was waiting 29 hours for a returning flight, and I now hate United Airlines with a flaming passion. Whatever you do, never ever fly with United Airlines, it is a massive waste of precious time and money and the awful service is nowhere near worth it.";NEGATIVE

Although I had some difficulties but United did take care of me although they had many people to care for. They first gave $20 meal voucher, then after a few hours they could not find new plane, they booked me to a hotel and booked me through American Airline to fly me back from Boston to Dallas the next day. This is the first time I experienced this problem, but they did take care of us. I want to say thank you.";POSITIVE

Wait but it’s not over getting home my flight ended up taking off late but I wasn’t surprised at all! Then getting to the airport my suitcase was put on the wrong airplane and I had to wait a hour and a half again.

The plane in both directions were very small and had no overheads to accommodate the regulation size carryons which was included in my fare. Flying Economy Plus? Not sure, they have so many different levels depending on what a la cartes you picked! First the ticket agent in Chattanooga made me check my carry on and pay  $25. When got to gate the same agent gave everyone in boarding area baggage tags to check them for free on the jetway! Did file complaint with United and they have responded to my issue with a refund, so one plus for them. But, the agent, hopefully, will be reprimanded. It was dishonest to charge me and I did not realize till I boarded plane. Return flight, we got in early. They did not have bags in jetway as we deplaned! Instead, we waited 45 minutes after 11 PM for bags to enter carousel in baggage claim. Very exhausting that time of night. Why did they not make it convenient for us to grab as we got off plane? Overall, flying pinched inside a tiny seat with little leg room was awful. the plane was 57 degrees on return flight and stewardess said they were working on -  did finally begin to warm after 2 hours, just before landing. Did not partake of the free drinks and pretzels, so can't speak to snacks, seem crazy in short legs of flight. Would not look forward to flying again and booking online. Too many options you can pick from that just keep adding up and seem annoyingly presented on entire page to get you to spend more. Used to fly a lot, and will not miss it if never go again.";NEGATIVE

Pilot said we were waiting for mechanics to come to tighten some bolts (I do not know if he was speaking seriously). Food on board not as described on menu: hamburger had no lettuce, tomatoes, or pickles as promised. As small as it was and served bare it was just like a 99c white castle hamburger. Seats comfortable and cabin crew kind and gentle. Agent at PSP kept trying to get money from me: first he claimed I'd have to remove 3 lbs b/c suitcase was 73 lbs. He had another bag on the scale. After removing it he said I was 1lb over and I said that 23 kilos is 51 lbs. He didn't care. Then insisted I pay $25 to check a suitcase even though was making an international connexion to one of their partners, but the swarthy 20-year old doesn't know what qualifies as a connexion. I couldn't convince him or his supervisor and they refused to call a ticketing expert. I was firm and insistent but because this supervisor told me I was rude (limited vocabulary), I paid the fine. I am constantly baffled that people who hate coming into contact with the public and who have no talent for customer service seem to be hired by United again and again. ";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2018-07-04;" | Las Vegas to Chicago via Los Angeles. On a business trip. Aircraft were relatively old and nothing special about the crew or the flights. The problem occurred when was flying from ORD to NYC LaGuardia LGA flight was supposed to leave at 5pm suddenly flight got cancelled without further information except due to weather conditions. The 4pm flight is going ahead and the 6pm flight as well. To my surprise the 3pm, 5pm and 7pm flights are cancelled to NYC however the 4pm, 6pm and 8pm flights are normal operation. Then the chaos started tried to rebook myself on a standby for the 6pm flight didn’t work out checked with the United staff and they are probably deaf or not listening or helping not knowing where my luggage are or how to locate them or where to go. No one from the ground staff is helping and all they say it’s due to weather we can’t help you and there’s no further flights to NYC till tomorrow afternoon while I have to attend an important meeting at 8:30AM. This situation was just a joke. Eventually located my luggage which already been sent to LGA on the 6pm flight which I don’t understand how would they send luggage without the passenger being on board the flight and had to queue with my colleague for almost 2 hours to rebook ourselves. When we reached the counter the only option the clerk gave us was to rebook to Hartford which is 2 hrs away from NYC we had to accept that and sort ourselves from Hartford then that particular flight got delayed which makes it arrive in Hartford at 3am which impossible for us to find our way to NYC. Eventually we booked ourselves on a different airline and paid 500 USD each for a one way ticket from Chicago to New York City. Seriously the most unorganised airline in the world. Later on we discovered that they had a system failure and that’s why they couldn’t operate certain flights but to avoid compensating passengers or booking hotels for them they delcraed it’s due to weather. Will never fly with this airline ever again. It’s the first and last experience with them.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-07-03;" | Fort Lauderdale to Houston. Somehow United managed to turn from one of the best airlines in the US into the worst. Dated website and check-in portal that looks like it was developed in the 90s and has not been changed since then (especially the online check-in), non-transparent seating assignment for basic economy. I somehow end up at the very end of the plane almost every flight and sometimes separated from other family/friends on the same itinerary, despite early check-ins. Anyone from United can explain that? The airline has a low grade low-coster feel to it - old planes and dated looking everything. Did I mention the prices.... the ridiculous prices they charge for everything - even for basic economy airfare? Well there is a flex-economy, and a premium economy, and maybe an economy plus and economy XL to be added sometimes soon, but don't be optimistic with the names of tariffs. The price for airfare is ridiculously expensive, especially if you are based in Houston and out of luck as you don't have access to other airlines (United must be lobbying this very hard). Even the most basic economy option is way too expensive for domestic flights, especially if you want to pack up a swimming suite with you in a small suitcase as there comes the baggage fees, extra baggage fees if you take your small checked suitcase on board, pay if you want to sit next to the isle or window, or your family member, pay for obsolete entertainment options: lack of free wifi yet extremely slow if you finally decide to swipe your card for it. My favorite - pay if you want to watch Direct-TV on a contrast lacking micro-screen in front of you - a paid streaming TV on board of a plane - You. Must. Be. Kidding. Me! Culmination of this ""entertainment"" system happened on my recent night flight from Houston to Miami. The system glitched completely and was stuck in startup loop during the whole flight blasting that 100% brightness Direct-TV logo on and off (in my face!) the whole night without possibility to turn that screen off. Now to the meals and snacks! - What snacks!? - Ah the mini-pretzels and and that is it. At least soda and the lavatories are free for now! I have flown many airlines, and can confidently say that Easyjet, Southwest, AA and Delta are all better airlines then United, by all means - price, comfort, entertainment, convenience and transparency and fairness to its clients. How come I am able to fly between Miami, Vegas, LA and NY for 200-300$ with other airlines but it costs me at least 300$ to fly to the nearest major destination out of Houston, which most of the time is half the distance of the above-mentioned flights? How come low-costers in Europe can get you from Norway to Spain round-trip for 100$ while this behemoth is crying going out of business if they lower the prices. Unfortunately I am currently based in Houston and don't have much access to other airlines due to long lasting monopoly of this company on the local market so have to unwillingly stick to it. On the positive side I can mention ground and cabin crew. These folks are always welcoming. I used to like United Airlines back in the days, but if today you ask me to characterize and summarize this airline in 4 words, those words would be: expensive, dated, unfair and non-transparent.";NEGATIVE

I asked for assistance, the agent was very rude, she never came to help I had to figure things out myself and then on top of that I still didnt even get an assigned seat. After checking in you have to go to the to the gate and let the agent give you a seat after everyone else is assigned, this is only one step above standby. Everyone was scattered throughout the plane and no one was sitting with their family, people had to switch seats on their own. I paid for a checked bag for my wife and her bag never made it into the plane. We were told that they would have to deliver it.

Now my flight was cancelled last minute and after trying to contact the company they said our only option was to travel back home 2 days after  our scheduled date. We asked about stand by and they said there was no way we could do stand by because the flights were completely booked. First of all that's a lie. Then they said they'd be able to get us on separate flights one at 11am and the other at 550 the next day. So we accepted since it's better than waiting 2 days. we decided to go to the airport an hour after talking on the phone since we weren't near the airport at that time and the man on the counter said we were able to get on a flight that same night which was the flight after the one we were scheduled to get on but since the other lady had already booked our separate flights it was no longer an option. So already beyond annoyed at this point. My friend then goes to the airport at 8am the next day for his 11am flight and they tell him that there's plenty available space on the 830am flight!  How was this not mentioned the day before. He barely made it to the 830am flight and then I decided to head to the airport straight after to see if I can get on the next flight home. They finally allowed me to do standby but 2 flights later still no space according to them. I am missing work and important meetings because employees don't care about their customers.

I fly approximately 25 flights a year with United. 70% are delayed or I experience an issue. I dream of the day when I no longer have to board another United flight.

I had to change my flight last minute which was fine because we were only maybe an hour behind schedule. My family and I were finally on our first flight and I was getting ready to sleep for the next 5 hours before landing in DC. I believe it was the autopilot who came on to talk about how they were having issues with the plane but he assured us that they are working on it. First they had the maintenance people come, then there was something about paperwork needing to be signed and finally, the autopilot mentioned that the gas was in the wrong area or chamber. I've sat on this plane for maybe an hour and half and now I'm rushing to call customer service to get me on the next flight ASAP because the flight was cancelled. Apparantly, the next two flight to SF was booked but my family of 3 can be waitlisted in case someone canceled. Did I mention that one man was absolutely going nuts when we all got off the plane? He mentioned something about his brother is on life support. There was also a huge line of people waiting to be waitlisted. However, I manage to book a flight for 12:58pm. At this point, my family and I have been at the airport for 7 hours. Finally, we get on the 12:58pm plane and we land in DC on time for our flight to Pittsburgh. It was storming on and off while on the first plane with plenty of turbulance. We were also delayed on the second flight! I thought they were going cancel our flight due to weather but they didn't and we did manage to get to Pittsburgh around 11-12pm. United Airline actually gave my family $300 for our next flight but the chances of us flying ever again is slim. This whole trip was an absolute nightmare with the delays and cancellation. On top of that, sitting in economy class is the most uncomfortable place to be. Honestly, take some advice from people who make genuinely comfortable lounge chairs with cushions in it please. There was absolutely no support at all and no room on the plane. The only good thing about the flights was that I was given free apple juice. I will never fly again if I can avoid it.";NEGATIVE

We're not talking about top shelf scotch either - try standard 10 yr Glenfiddich at about $50/bottle. For free one can have some bottom of the rung local bourbon. United don't seem to function with anything other than a penny wise, pound foolish philosophy. I am looking forward to booking with Virgin Australia or Qantas for my next similar flight. On the flight over I was underwhelmed by the cramped business class capsule. The seat was comfortable but I'm slim. And I felt that I just fitted into the seat width. Service was non existent. Had to ring the service buzzer twice for water. Never handed out bottles when lights go out like other airlines. Neither did they go around asking selfish passengers to close their window blind when most were trying to sleep with daylight outside. On a 14 hr flight this is detrimental to all the other passengers wellbeing as it made it hard to sleep. There is basically no storage in the capsule in front of one, or to the side. The limited storage is behind and to the side, right where all the cables for headphones and chargers sit. Their business class cabin looks cheap. It is serviced like a cheap budget airline. But they know how to charge like a premier airline. They can't even offer a business class passenger before departing on a 15 hour flight a free scotch. Except you can have a very cheap bourbon. Cheap seems to be their mantra.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-06-29;" |  I was scheduled to fly from Washington DC (IAD) to Newark (EWR) with United Airlines and then continue via SAS from EWR to Copenhagen. Due to weather issues in the greater NY area the United flight was delayed by 6 hours and my connecting flight had left when I arrived at EWR. At IAD I had explained to United agents that my luggage was checked in all the way to Copenhagen, and that I needed guidance regarding if/how/where I needed to pick up my luggage when arriving in EWR. I was simply told to explain my situation to United agents when arriving at EWR. Following guidance from the United flight crew I stood in line for two hours to speak to a United agent at the United EWR customer care booth located next to my arrival gate. When I finally talked to an agent I was asked to go to the United baggage claim booth. After having waited another hour the United baggage claim agent informed me that she had located the luggage, but that I had to wait at least another 5 hours for my bag to be brought to the United baggage claim area. I was then told to show up 8.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage (*note that after arriving at EWR Scandinavian Airlines had manage to re-book me via American Airlines to go to Miami and then via a SAS flight to Copenhagen). By the time United told me to leave without my luggage it was 12.30 AM in the night – 12.5 hours after departing IAD airport. I was offered no hotel options. After having spent 35 min a cab to reach a friend’s apartment in NYC I spent another 30 min in a cab ($150 out of pocket) and returned to EWR 7.30 AM the following day to collect my luggage. A third United agent then told me that they could not locate my luggage in their system and that it likely was with SAS. I was then told that since the SAS office only opens 9 AM the right thing would have been to wait the five hours the previous night. This conversation took 30 secs and it was made very clear that this was not United problem and that I was advised to board my American Airlines flight without my luggage and file a lost luggage complaint with SAS upon arriving in Copenhagen, which I then did. I arrived in Copenhagen 8 am and had to continue straight to my air-bnb and then to the university. At this point I had slept 2-3 hours since my departure at Dulles on the 19th (2 days ago) and I had no new clothes to change into. Upon returning to IAD from Copenhagen on June 24th I still had not received my luggage. After being passed from one United agent to another at IAD I was told that my luggage was at EWR. I filed a lost luggage complaint with United and since received around 10 text messages saying that my luggage was not located. Early morning 12.39 AM on June 27th, while asleep, I get a text by a private company contracted by United stating that they are “attempting to deliver my luggage” and I am asked to call/text to confirm my address. 6.02 AM I write back to confirm my address and I text the private agent to call me before dropping off my luggage. I leave my apartment 6.40 AM only to discover that the private agent had left my luggage outside my building without notifying me. ";NEGATIVE

The beer & wine selection is limited to 1 or 2, or they want to charge $9 for a drink - nice touch after you have paid $5,000+ for a ticket. Food offerings consisted of some trail mix, some cold veggies & some soup. How United believe they can compete with this type of inferior International service is lost on me. No United Execs have apparently never flown on the International competition, or they would be embarrassed to hype Polaris. Flight attendant came around 1 time during the 1st hour of the flight - once. I had a glass of red wine, but when she returned for her 2nd visit, she announced they had already ran out of red wine for the remainder of the flight.

united-airlines;2018-06-27;" |  After a recent business trip to Tucson, my coworker and I received the worst customer service from not one, but two United representatives. We arrived at the Tucson airport about an hour and a half early and while we were heading to our gate we received a push notification that the flight was delayed so we went and grabbed food, and set up at a charging station a few gates down. When it was getting close to the time that we would need to start boarding, we walked over to the gate and found out that the flight left at its scheduled time. No updates, no announcement for boarding, nothing. The woman at the gate laughed it off saying that when the pilot wants to leave the pilot leaves. With no more flights leaving from Tucson that day on United, we were infuriated. The woman was not empathetic, wouldn’t look us in the eyes, and gave us no other options but to stay in Tucson (not comped by United, mind you) and arrive to Cleveland at 3pm the next day. We called the customer service line and the representative literally said “I don’t understand why you weren’t at your gate, you should have been there”. After he also unempathetically didn’t even try to help us, I asked to speak to a manager. I’m pretty sure I spoke to the same guy who just changed his voice into a higher pitched tone. He said the same and wouldn’t even give me a refund, gave me a hard time about missing the flight and said that he knows that they make courtesy announcements before taking off. Apparently you don’t, or I wouldn’t have been stranded in Tucson. After finally calling again and speaking to a much nicer woman, we were able to get a partial refund and bought tickets on American Airlines flying just a few hours later. I’ve never had such a poor customer service experience in my life and will never fly with United again unless absolutely necessary. Taking my business elsewhere!";NEGATIVE

We called the night before to make sure everything was okay with the flight and it was. However, when we get to the airport which is 2 hours away from where we live we get a call once we are at the airport that the flight was cancelled. So, we think that we will just be getting on another flight so we will still be able to get to our destination that day. We stood in line to check in for about 35 minutes and then the person there, after failing to put in our confrontation code 3 times, told us that our flight has been rescheduled for tomorrow and that we might not even be able to get on that flight. I’m really disappointed in United Airlines in their lack of communication. We weren’t even told why the flight was canceled. They wasted our time and lost our business. Not that they truly care but my mother’s family who were suppose to pick her up took the day off work and my mother, who hasn’t seen her family for many years now, is forced to go back home and wait because United Airlines can’t get their priority’s straight. Your customers should be your main priority and clearly they aren’t.";NEGATIVE

The first time we called they hung up on us. All in all we were almost 7 hours late to our destination.

The crew was very professional and served snacks and water and informed us continuously and the doors were reopened just in case somebody wanted to leave the aircraft. United proactively rebooked me on a later flight just in case the issue would not have been fixed. In the end we did depart with a delay. The rest of the flight was uneventful. I was flying Economy Plus and the seat was comfortable and offered enough legspace. United Economy Plus is the same seat and same onboard service as it is in regular Economy but with some inches of more legspace. I just flew with a different us carrier in the Premium Economy Class/Comfort Plus class and they also offer a free alcoholic drink and a premium snack in the Economy Plus section. United should do the same thing and upgrade the Economy Plus section.";POSITIVE

Our children had to enter the aircraft on the back and we had to enter the aircraft on the front. This was on our way back home. When we connected through Houston I noticed that my luggage was damaged. So I have a three hour layover in Houston and I figured I would go and talk to baggage services, as I did not want to handle it when I arrive in Denver at 11:30 at night. I mean why not handle it at a normal time of day when I have three hours to kill, but the person working the United baggage service tells me she can’t do a claim for me and it must be done at my final destination. When I asked why couldn’t it just be handled right now she said that is United Airlines policy. I’m sorry, but when your policy causes agitation to a customer, and you have no explanation besides it’s your policy then that is something that should be changed. I found it comical that United airlines employee tells me that I need to post on social media about how negative my experience was. I doubt that will do any good.

(9 hours) then that flight is delayed another hour. So 10 hours in airports to go to a place that would have taken me 8 hours to drive to. If I fly a discounted airline I expect this type of service because you get what you pay for but United although gives cut rate service their prices are not cut rate. Then I paid for upgraded seats but they said that didn’t matter anymore. This is the fourth time in a row flying United and having major issues. I can care less about food, chairs or even the way the flight crew treats passengers but don’t charge me to get to a destination that I could have driven to in a lot less time. I will be asking for some money back. Not a voucher either because I will never take united again unlesss I have a sudden urge to spend a whole day in the airport. Their employees in the Houston airport are not nice which is probably because they are tired of coming up with excuses for their employers lack of management or leadership.

We now will be going to San Fran in between. Oh and no one on board knows when we will actually take off. According to multiple flight attendants, there are no updates? So, we are stuck here on the plane with no options, no plan for leaving, and a required additional stop that was unplanned.

What happened to the barf bags (just in case someone got sick) and the blankets and pillows? I think that we were overcharged for baggage. The aircraft loads by groups. We were in group 2. A fellow and his daughter, who were in group 4, got on the group 2 line. When he got to the gate, the attendant told him that he was in the wrong group but she would let me board ""this time."" He had 3 rolling cases plus a large backpack. The flight instructions specifically say ""only one rolling case allowed per person"".

Right after I got off the plane, I asked the ground service to give me a delay certificate, and they told me they didn’t have, and said that I should have asked when I was in DEN, but I was stuck on the plane for almost an hour, who can I ask for a delay certificate? The ground staff didn’t do the job well. They were supposed to know the situation of the flight and assist the passengers. When a flight delayed for an hour and half, they should have prepared delay certificates or at least told the passengers where to get the certificates. In the end, I ran to catch my coming flight and made it, but my luggage didn’t. It seems like United Airlines doesn’t care about their passengers if they can’t catch their connections.";NEGATIVE

On this 7.5 hour flight I was served one hot meal, one hot snack, a small snack, and unlimited beverages. One flight attendant was extremely nice to me and even brought me two ice cream’s. I upgraded to economy plus for around $200 and the only thing you get is more leg room. The seat is the same as in the regular economy cabin and the service is the same. The Internet I thought was very expensive around $30 for the entire flight so I passed on that option however I would definitely fly United again.

His name was not included in the boarding pass and we had to suffer standing in the long waiting lines. It's just common sense that when you give us an option to online check in, and we use it that means we want to avoid standing in lines. Since we are travelling with an infant on lap, and the flight had to start with 1 hr delay and we were on the runway, we asked if they can help me with something to keep my baby's milk fresh, they gave us the airsick bag full of ice for which I was happy, but unfortunately the bag was not water proof (not plastic, it was paper bag). We did not knew this and all our other bags became wet as the ice melted. This is a 5 hr 41 min flight, which means passengers expect some food on the flight. The male attendant was not at all cooperative with me or any of the passengers around me. I don't understand why they have a menu with 5 or 6 pages with different types of food options.May be they are using the same menu across all their domestic and international flights to save money from printing different menu cards for different routes.

My neighbor unintentionally reset the video throughout the trip. The video flashes endless ads for paid streaming access while you're trying to sleep. Even once I figured out how to turn it off my neighbor's elbow would turn it back on again. Who thought this was a good design idea?

On May 21, 2018, the United Airlines flight was canceled for 4 passengers, in which my husband and I had purchased all four tickets. This was the worst travel experience that I have encountered. The customer service of United Airlines is at most, deplorable. To begin, the flight that was canceled on 5/21/18 from BNA to IAH was canceled due to weather conditions that were non-existent. The cancellation was only reported 3-4 hours before the flight was set to take off. This placed us in a compromising position as we had a connecting flight to Honolulu (HNL) from Houston (IAH), the only flight for this destination, for that day. We had to scramble to find a nearby flight from Hunstville, AL, which is two hours away from where we reside. We attempted to call a United Airlines representative to help us find seats for all four passengers, but we were unsuccessful. My husband and I were the only couple that could fly from Huntsville into Houston and then into HNL. The other couple was forced to fly from Huntsville, to Denver, to San Francisco, to Los Angeles, and then to Honolulu. The customer service that we received over the phone from the representative was atrocious. The representative was ignorant when giving information on the flights, she rudely retorted comments back that reflected her ignorance, and due to her procrastination our travel plans were further delayed. We had to drive to the HSV airport and leave our car in long term parking. All of these incidents incurred an extra expense, for which should be compensated for by United Airlines. All we received was a measly flight credit of $75.00 for my husband and I and we purchased four tickets!";NEGATIVE

Imagine if this was a 400$ hotel room and you get there to find your room isn't ready for 6 hours and they over booked so you have to stay in a budget hotel anyways, just ridiculous. meanwhile the executives are taking home million $ bonuses chartering private planes cause they don't even want to fly on their own airline.

But when I went to receive my checked bag for the night in the hotel, I was told that I was unable to get the bag and couldn’t have access to it til tomorrow. United is the worst airline I have flown, regarding everything from check in to reliability. At the Nashville airport there were 9 total delayed flights and 8 of them were United.

I have never had my seating changed by any airline after choosing a seating assignment if they ""cant be guaranteed"" there is no advantage flying United over Southwest aside from paying more money. They had availability to accommodate to economy plus but of course wanted more money. we had to change flights adding a 4 hour layover and pickup arrangements just to sit next to each other. No wonder United ranks so poorly in customer service. I will avoid flying this airline at all costs in the future, its more important to try and suck another $300 out of a customer than accommodate and make it right. I will also be canceling my United Plus card as it serves no benefits. It does us no good to travel together if only one person on the card gets priority.

Once on board, however, I noticed that the TVs had been removed and replaced with personal device entertainment holders. However, we were informed that the Wi-Fi did not work and, as such, we wouldn't be able to use the Personal Device Entertainment. A six hour flight with no TVs or Wi-Fi. Unbelievable. Throughout my whole experience, the crew was incredibly rude and inattentive. Upon landing at SFO, we waited on the taxiway for 50+ minutes since (as the captain told it) United operations had screwed up and didn't have a gate for us. There were a number of passengers connecting on to other destinations, many of which there is only one flight a day to from SFO. All told, we arrived at the gate around 1.5 hours late. Combined with our delay leaving BOS, many of my fellow passengers missed their connections and had to be put up overnight. My experience on the return flight was slightly better — the Wi-Fi/personal device entertainment worked and the crew was more courteous — but the damage had been done. If I have any choice, I'll never fly with United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

We then ended up missing our connection. Stood in customer service for over an hour. Not that it would have changed anything, but they didn’t even apologize. We then got on our flight and sat on the runway for 2 hours. There wasn’t one update at all! I mean come on. I thought I was being pranked. I asked the workers and they said they would let us know. Never did we hear anything or get an apology. Not even a free cocktail. Heck I would have been happy with some water when waiting for so long. This was terrible and I would never fly United again. I fly 100 times a year and this is by far the worst. Do not make the mistake flying United. I thought it was just bad luck all the negutivity surrounding them but it all makes sense. We then had to have a United employee help us find the new best route possible. We thought the experience was going to get better, wrong! He ended up booking us on to the wrong flight which we didn’t figure out until we were supposed to leave. I could keep going but I think you get the point. Whatever you do never fly United. Even if you have to pay a little bit more it could save your trip.";NEGATIVE

On top of all of this, we have been delayed for two hours because the pilots aren’t here, but the plane has been here an hour. Oh, and they made people check their carry-on luggage and pay the baggage fee. This is the most disgusting experience ever and it will be our last with this company.";NEGATIVE

I only had 30 minutes to go through customs and get my bag then find my connecting flight in this huge airport. I didn’t even make it through security, missed my flight home. So I got a standby and I know for a fact I was the first person from Mexico City to get a standby ticket to Tulsa! I used my mobile customs app so it took me seconds to get through. The women boarding the plane just picked random names. I’m confused on why the names aren’t in order! They should be first come first on a plane! So I didn’t get on it and was stuck in Houston until the next morning at 8am. But I’m mainly writing this review because everyone that works at United airlines in Houston TX are miserable. Everyone I’ve talked to has had an attitude and I don’t understand why. It’s your job - I’m just asking a question because I have no idea what to do! I’m by myself in a city I don’t know and a massive confusing airport, that likes to change gates regularly. ";NEGATIVE

Flight delayed 4 hours and counting, notification was not sent until after the 2hr required time to be at the airport. Gate personell nicely told us it was an ""Act of God"" and was not the least bit interested in making our time at the airport pleasant. The poor man behind the counter asked for help and with a line of 2 carrier and his supervisor said, ""Just excuse yourself, they can wait."" We asked for a pass to the lounge to pass the next 4 hours and they wanted to charge us 69.00 like we were walking in off the street. The inflight entertainment was not accessible and our tablets are brand new and we had to pay an extra 100 just to be able to sit in our seat without the person next to you sitting in your lap plus we paid 50 to check one bag a piece. I have always flown United but this may be our last trip for the price of our flight I have much better expectations. I have flown internationally and all over the US on many carriers and this has by far been my worst experience and this is the 2nd time this has happened to me at this airport. I am very disappointed.";NEGATIVE

The flight stays option does not label information which causes confusion when reading. This can be frustrating when making travel plans. The flight attendant was the main issue. As a representative of the company, I would think you would want your attendants to be clean looking. Not as if they were hungover from partying the night before. Hair a tangled mess and makeup smeared. Her attitude towards customers was welll below par, making faces after one gentlemen ordered extra and snarky with her responses. Needless to say I will not be returning.";NEGATIVE

Then I was told “it’s the governments fault your plane was behind so we can’t offer a hotel voucher, just a discount.” I am now sitting in the airport overnight waiting. No meal voucher. Nothing.

I've been flying with united for quite a while and now I have had enough. Had family problems come up and had a round trip planned and it costs $200 just to change the date and more money for the flight price difference. If it was cheaper I would be more understandable but when you have to pay almost $400 to get home 2 days earlier it's kind of ridiculous and I will never fly United again. ";NEGATIVE

Needless to say, the connecting plane was still connected to the terminal. Had to wait an additional 3 hours for a flight. Will never fly with United again. Also most uncomfortable seats ever.";NEGATIVE

Before even getting to the airport I called to speak to a rep in regards to my first flight being delayed and was cutting it close to the end of boarding of the connecting flight (15 minutes). I was told by the rep that they had no way of contacting the airport to let them know that there were passengers delayed from their first flight but would be arriving just as boarding closed. I asked to speak to someone else and the rep said ""I can't transfer you, but you can call back and wait through it all again"", not impressed. Then at the Buffalo airport we were reassured that we would make our second flight as long as this first one left on the scheduled time still, and if not we would be given a hotel room for the night, refunded for our hotel missed and sent out at 8:40 am the next day. Well what do you know, we missed our connecting flight by 5 minutes as they closed the gates, the ""hotel"" we were told we would be given was actually all booked as their was a rally in town and we were told we could ""sleep on the safe airport floor"" by the Supervisor at Washington-Dulles. Also, the 8:40 am flight we were told we would be on was actually 12:00 pm. Now for the ""reimbursement"" we were told we would get, that was a joke. We were told we would be reimbursed for our hotel that we had to stay in (IN VIRGINIA), the hotel we missed, our cab rides etc -  we were not. We were offered flight vouchers (I will never fly with them again) and then offered to be reimbursed for one night, and the cabs. Disgusting customer service. Everyone told us something different, and in the end we were out over $250 in the hotel room we missed, data overages to find accommodations and food. Book with anyone else, it is not worth the cheap ticket price.";NEGATIVE

Then it was time to hurry up and board. The line was a disaster. No one could tell where the line was. Or, exactly what was going on. Were we boarding or were we delayed? The app wasn’t updated. People were worried about getting their carry-on bags on because they kept announcing that it was a full flight and they were worried about space. So people were trying to get on plane as fast as they could to secure space. People were cutting in line and being super aggressive. The people in charge could have cared less. They were oblivious to what was going on, but seemed hurried. We finally get on plane, many had to check bags which was time consuming. Now we sit on runway.

However, my seat was changed and all United personnel refused to help me find a seat to accommodate me. Then when I arrived at my assigned seat 17D, I discovered the seat did not recline.

united-airlines;2018-06-05;" | Newark to Santa Barbara via San Francisco. Worst. Experience. Ever. From start to - and not even at our final destination yet. I’d give them zero stars if I could. Flight from Buffalo to Newark was delayed for 2 hours (understandable as I’ve traveled extensively in the past.) While waiting, the company tag line used on the plan to the passengers was as follows: “seems like its an electrical maintenance issue on Newark’s part. Sorry everyone.” Still relatively understandable. This made us miss our 2 other connecting flights moving forward. When trying to reroute our flights once we finally got to Newark, we asked the customer service rep for the airline to put us up in a hotel in San Francisco because we’d be stuck at the airport until 8:45 am (after landing around midnight as it was the earliest flight to Santa Barbara/home.) “No. It was because of weather. We don’t do that if it’s because of weather,” the customer service rep advised. At no point was the weather cited as any part of the cause for the delay! Whatever. Horrible attitudes with the employees at the gate as well. Finally we were able to get on to our re-routed flight (which, by the way, was also delayed for almost 2 hours as well.) I have a roller bag that easily fits in the overhead compartment. Before the plane was even 1/2 full, they started pulling luggage to check in. At the gate, I explained explicitly said that if I check my bag, I need to grab it from the gate itself and not have them send it directly to our final destination (Santa Barbara) or the general checked-in luggage. There was plenty of overhead space by my seat, mind you. Nope! We had to leave the gated area to the baggage carousels, where the flight attendant told us to go, and nothing. No bag. Apparently they were “holding it” to get it on our last flight which leaves in 7 hours! I have things in there I need! And now the security checkpoint is closed so we can’t even get back into a nice quiet area to find a place to sleep for even a little bit because of the sheer lack of communication, horrible customer service, and complete lack of empathy. I will never again fly with United and I hope nobody else will either.";NEGATIVE

So she got on the plane since they told her to and once she was on they told her they canceled me and my sons flight. The ramp was still connected to the plane when I was trying to get on and my friend said they hadn't even shut the plane door yet and on top of that when I looked at the flight after they took off the flight status was “early departure”. There was no reason to not let me on the plane and and the lady I was speaking to was rude and also the lady my friend spoke to on the plane was rude! My friend said the flight attendant had just shrugged her shoulders with a smirk on her face and said well we already canceled her and her sons flight.

united-airlines;2018-05-29;" |  San Francisco to Tokyo Haneda. I've had mixed feelings about this airline. I was careless enough that the ANA ticket that I purchased was actually operated by United Airlines. The horrifying experience with them starts from customer service. I telephoned them obtaining inquiries on how a less than 24 hour transit would handle baggage. I was informed that the baggage will transfer directly to my connecting flight (which was finally, and thank heavens, ANA from Haneda to Manila). The reservation agent said that connecting within 24 hour transit will not result the baggage to be claimed in HND and will be directly handled in MNL. Fine. We checked in Day of our flight with our luggage weighing less than 50 lbs, 5 luggage due to my star alliance gold status, along with my brother's normal traveler status. We were informed that the luggage will be offloaded in Haneda. This is a conflicting to the information I was provided few hours ago. The check in agent said ""You can just re-check in to your next flght"" I asked her, ""are you sure"", she was proud to answer ""NO"". Why suggest with utmost certainty to do such thing without verifying your sources. I had asked for supervisor and I was replied with ""We do not have a supervisor, he is busy!"" I am at my point of my fumes reaching to the airport's ceiling on the way how I am being handled. Finally, the supervisor at that time came and handled our baggage with manual baggage tags. The check in agent even uttered ""good luck in finding these bags"", while the supervisor gave her a blank stare. These words were also added to our fiasco Agent: There is no way I will write manual airport codes with these baggage tags, they will get lost for sure. (At least she cares about my baggage possibility of being lost). Agent: Your baggage cannot be held at the airport for security purposes. Really, security purposes? I will travel with my luggage for more than 12 hours (note it will go through a strict security check, hence, adding another 12 hours should not make any difference to impose threat to security. I am not sure why United continue to impress us with their undying no customer style of service. It was not United Airlines ticket that I purchased, it was under ANA but unfortunately, the operating flight was United. The check-in agent did not offer us any help that at least by reaching Haneda, a ground staff would assist us with our luggage to connect to another airline. I guess by customer's putting up their weak customer service to even lower than worst, keeps them in the market. Never again.";NEGATIVE

There would have been no way to communicate to my wife where she needed to go, where her bags went, and where I went. I wasn’t going to strand my wife and leave her behind. Then my wife returned and sprinted to get to the gate where I flagged her down. After getting on board, the gate attendant came back and continued berating me in front of the whole plane about not leaving my wife behind and denying to board until my wife was with me. Terrible service, never flying United again. I hope this gate attendant is made to undergo public relations training and learns how to speak politely to the people to the people who are why she gets paid.

In this email it also stated that I was able to change my seat for free as long as it was in the same class cabin (economy-economy plus). I then called United to have my flight changed which would in turn change my seat. I was flying economy but the only available seats were for economy plus however that did not matter because United said that they would waive any change fees and any seat change fees. When I called to try and have my flight changed I was spoke into extremely nasty, I was told I didn’t know what I was talking about, and I was told ""that’s just how it is"", when I try to explain that United had already waived the change fee for the seat and customer service was still trying to charge me $150. I was determined to get on this flight as my scheduled flight was already delayed five hours. The flight I was trying to get on was delayed an hour. I did not give up as I went to the airport went through TSA and got to my gate. I had to physically show the email to her United worker to get them to believe me. I do not understand how the company is not in sync with their employees. How are you sending out mass emails that your own employees don’t know about it makes no sense at all.

The United airlines attendant said could I get the small plastic bag into the other bag and I responded that I was sorting and it would be empty by the time I got to the gate. She said I am sorry but I cannot let you check in unless you put the contents of the plastic bag in the under the seat bag. I stayed at the kiosk and started the sorting through my papers. A supervisor came up and approved me saying I was only allowed one personal item, which I knew.

I payed a lot of extra money for a late flight one evening (8 pm), and then they kept delaying it due to “weather” in San Francisco, even though every other airline’s flights had no delays or cancellations to SF. They eventually cancelled my flight due to said weather at 10:45 pm (another United flight to SF at 11 pm that night took off without delays so I know it wasn’t weather). Then I had to get in line for an agent to rebook, which was >100 people long. In the hour I waited, I called United and was placed on a “5-10 minute hold” that was actually >30 minutes, only to tel me there’s nothing they can do. When I got to the agent finally, around midnight, he rebooked me for an AM flight and gave me a 35% discount to nearby hotels but no free stay since the cancellation was “out of their control.” He promised me that if I payed for the hotel however, that United would reimburse me no questions asked. I confirmed this several times and he literally promised me this is the case. I payed $100 for the nearest hotel and spent the night. I filed the complaint to get my money back and they replied 5 days later with a short email saying they will not reimburse me anything but hope I can overloo this and continue to use their airline... I called United to clarify and they said customers are unable to speak to customer service on the phone, only email. This has been an infuriating process and I will certainly never use United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-05-23;" |  Albuquerque to Raleigh Durham via Denver. This has got to be the worst experience with an airline. Never in my life have a missed a flight and due to unforeseen circumstances we were running a bit behind. When checking in our bags there was a further delay due to some baglogs with the luggage’s. Since we were running behind, we asked how we were doing on time for boarding and the lady looked at our bags and said we had plenty of time. Then the TSA line was running very slow and were not able to do anything for us to expedite the process. We run to our gate and we find the gate closed but the desk attendant was opening the door for a passenger, but then as she is closing the door while the plane is still there, she just says YOU’VE MISSED YOUR FLIGHT. - again, she had just opened the door for a man right in front of us. The plane was Still there for another 7-10 minutes before it got disconnected from the bridge! Now there is no other flight to get us home until midnight, minded that we pleaded with her and told her that we have another flight to catch in the morning to Chicago. I understand the policy of getting to the airport with plenty of time to spare, unfortunately our morning was filled with issues that held us back. I don’t know what was going on with her day but that sure is not a way to show customer service. She was also rude and not cared one bit about our situation. I hope that as a corporation you are also training you employees about customer service, care, and a bit more of humanity. Neither her nr her manager at the ABQ airport showed neither of the characteristics of a position that requires customer service characteristics. I will never fly this  airline again and I will make sure to share my disappointing experience with others. I hope you can use this to train your employees better.";NEGATIVE

We were wanting to eliminate a long layover and had already sought out another flight to transfer too. We were then bounced around between customer service employees who would tell us they couldn’t help us but the next person would be able to. After meeting with three different employees, we finally had someone tell us our tickets were not applicable for flight transfers but gave us no rationale why. The customer service is poor, unprofessional, and lacks quality. I will never use this airline again.";NEGATIVE

United refused to offer a food voucher, refused any hotel accommodations in SF and refused any compensation for the flight delay. Called United and talked to supervisor Chris after an 1.25 hour hold. He just said, “can’t help you, write a review”. That’s it. I have never had a supervisor be so rude. This is the second time I have had an issue with terrible customer service with United in the last 8 months. The last time they would not let me cancel a ticket when I had bought trip insurance. I have never been treated so poorly. Very sad that this airline has zero customer service, and has gone from one of the best airlines to one of the worst. Hopefully they will care about these reviews and try to improve. We will see.";NEGATIVE

The food served was very acceptable and drinks were available when required. The Polaris flight was certainly an upgrade to the flight that we had from the UK to San Francisco! As a personal thing i would have preferred to have had a window seat as I did feel a little hemmed in in the aisle seat. Just one thing spoiled a short part of my journey. The rising wall between the two middle seats, of which I was travelling on one malfunctioned and sadly it came down and wouldn't return to the up position. This resulted in me being in very close proximity to the stranger in the seat next to me. Several of the stewardesses tried to rectify the situation sadly the wall remained in the down position for a couple of hours. It did however strangely rectify itself after a couple of hours which made me more comfortable.";POSITIVE

I said no he said ok have a nice drive home laughed and left. The customer service people weren't really wanting to help my family get home finally gave in and put us on a different airline.

First, they claimed it was maintenance issues, in which case they would have to pay us for the delay. Then, they claimed it was suddenly the weather. What? Trust me when I say the weather was not bad and would’ve cleared up completely by the time we got to Chicago. The staff did little to try to inform us about what was going on.

On our way to Las Vegas our flight was delayed 3 hours which made it impossible to get our flight mid way, so we had to get a flight 6 hours after which means we ended up being in an airport for 12+ hours. Not only this but we didn’t even receive a notification that it was delayed so we couldn’t even go back home or do anything but just sit. Then they refused to let us sit together, on any of our flights, luckily there was one person who offered to switch seats. They acted like because we paid for the cheaper seats that’s how we were gonna be treated. We couldn’t even take a carry on with our flight it was just ridiculous. We flew Delta a little less than a year before this and paid for the same type of ticket and when we asked if we could sit next to each other they said no problem at all and allowed us to have a carry on. United also overbooked our flight by 5 people, I don’t understand how do you overbook? Plus when we got our flight we had to PAY to watch anything on their little TVs, where in Delta it’s paid for. I don’t get any of this. Just doesn’t make sense to me! Just not happy with them at all. We will never again fly United.";NEGATIVE

We were not rude, just asked why it was small compared the other airlines. Not even about the 25$. Just tired of dealing with people trying to nickle and dime.

The irony is they ask you to use your own device but don't provide any power. I could not get the app to work, I didn't try to find a flight attendant because I had a book. Seat was 25K in the extra legroom and they made it clear you could not just move into this section. I'd rather fly a 2-3-2 layout 767 than a 3-3-3 787. It's such as shame that the modern aircraft are so horrendously tight so you have a choice of space but old IFE/no power or IFE/power but really narrow seats. The legroom was not spectacular given the $140 cost. Food was poor. Chicken or pasta. I had the chicken and the liquid tasted like stewed tea. Didn't finish it and could see others left it. Snack before landing was much nicer. This was a very expensive ticket due to my particular needs for a specific day / route for work so I understand but it is still galling to know I surely paid more than a few of the business class passengers to sit back here.";NEGATIVE

This cost me another 20 minutes in going back through a line that I had been in just for someone to say ok. This would be the only reason I would not fly United anymore.

You would think, but you would be wrong. United acts as if they are a ""preferred"" airline when really, I cringe at the thought of ever having to fly them. The only reason to consider them is cost, but you are giving up severe customer service while on board, while on the phone, or while trying to accommodate any emergencies that may come up.

With a disgusted tone she looks at the other attendant and says ""Let me guess he's sitting right here"" They both look at me like I have an arm growing out the side of my head and proceeds to tell me that there is a restroom right here, like I'm incapable of figuring that out on my own.

I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful.

We missed a day of vacation, lost our personal pick up, lost a day at the hotel and our first class Euro train tickets. I paid for German airlines and United messed up so bad we had to take United to New Jersey. Our New Jersey flight was taking off late but had to be returned do to an passenger not being able to fly. I had to rebuy my euro train pass for twice what I originally paid and later then my original ticket. When we got to Brussels there was an extra security check just for United. Our seats were not on the ticket, even though I bought the tickets 4 months ago. On the way home from Brussels the scheduled the flight so tight that we had to rush to make the plane. You were not able to buy any food on the plane either. When we got to Chicago, again the transfer flight was so close we barely had time to get through customs with a few minutes to spare running through the terminal. But it was ok because they didn't have a plane to fly. We were another 2 hours late getting home due to no plane and when they got a plane it was held up for maintenance problems again. Most of the time me and my girlfriend didn't even get to sit next to each other. So after paying for a hotel stay we didn't use, extra 100 dollars in taxi fees, airlines I specifically paid for and was not able to use, an extra 300 dollars in euro train fares and lost time visiting my very close friend I had not seen in 6 years. United said the best they could do was give me 60 dollars in food vouchers. It was a horrible experience. I feel so bad for the two employees out of 15 that actually were nice.";NEGATIVE

I was very anxious because i had a connection after Newark and it was doubtful i could make it. I asked the flight attendant and she couldn’t care less - she told me call your travel agent. Can you believe that. At that time a male flight attendant also on business class told me that if there is a problem United will book me on the next flight and told me not to worry. How hard was what be did? He was probably the only one paying attention to the training. Also the power socket on my seat was off. Again the female attendant turned her head the other way. The male attendant just said give me your cell phone i will have it charged for you. Again so simple.;NEGATIVE

This was the worst flight we’ve ever flown on and we were a party of 7, 5 children and two adults we had to sit on the plane for three hours before it took off and they didn’t take off - going to San Francisco should have it gone to Denver to refill with fuel and then it flew to San Francisco. Instead of getting there at approximately 10:00 PM we got there at 2am with five kids and the employees on the aircraft were super rude to our teenage kids. United airlines has the worst customer service we’ve ever seen on an airline they are just completely horrible they don’t take care of their passengers, especially people traveling with children. We had to stay in San Francisco overnight and then get all split up with the family because there were seven of us to be able to get flown home my husband left with four children at 9:45 and I could not get a flight with my other son until 4 o’clock the next day. It was completely horrible the process of getting rebooked took over two hours in the night time with nobody waiting in line and we had to have five people help us to get this all sorted out with the manager stepping in.";NEGATIVE

There were delays encountered on the Tampa to Newark flight due to weather, but we were kept informed all along the way and were even booked onto a standby connection should we have missed our original connection in Newark. We caught the connection with minutes to spare and fully expected our luggage to miss the flight, but to our surprise and delight it was right there on the carousel when we arrived in Dublin. There was an off-duty Cabin Crew member sitting next to us on the Tampa to Newark flight and she was also helpful and friendly, even though she was off-duty. She got information for us about our connecting flight and showed us where the gate was. I would have no problem in recommending United to anyone, and will definitely be flying with them again.";POSITIVE

My carry on bag was forcefully checked in to be in cargo and it was not handled delicately, I was not told to take my laptop or valuables out, at least not in English, and my screen cracked in the process. I don't blame the staff, I blame a lack of communication and United Airlines wanting to check people's bags in so they don't have to deal with people needing to get their belongings out. Also, who ever handled cargo almost lost my luggage, I had to wait almost 24 hours to find out if they found it because it was a late transfer to the right connecting flight. From the update I got, it was in Chicago when my connecting flight was from Newark to San Jose.";NEGATIVE

Once home, I was still able to ring out some of my clothing but multiple books, journals and magazines were ruined, swollen and tearing because they had been wet for hours. I was shocked no one even mentioned this to me or took responsibility for everything in the suitcase getting damaged.

I missed my flight because of a traffic issue on the way to the airport. I was rebooked and arrived just 3 hours late, my seats were upgraded. I asked for nothing. After collecting my luggage for a 10 day vacation I went to the auto rental to pick up my car. It was there that I realized I had lost my wallet. A first for me and quite problematic. No license, no money, no credit cards , no atm. No ID at all. The car rental bluntly said, no license,no car! And so abruptly ended my vacation plans because I was to drive nearly 3 hrs to my destination. I was traveling solo. After filing a lost wallet report, I headed back to the United counter to see what I could do. By this time it was 8pm. The agents got very busy on their computers for reasons I did not know. Ultimately, they handed me a voucher for a hotel room, a thermos filled with toiletries , 2 meal vouchers and a return ticket to Phoenix in the morning at 8:30am. While it was a crisis situation for me, their concern and consideration went well beyond anything I expected. I was so very grateful for their assistance and to United Airlines.";POSITIVE

Weather delays caused the entire chain of my connections to be missed and land me in Toronto too late to catch my next flight with a different airline. So, they rerouted me so that my connections were now Alexandria-Houston-Toronto. United Airlines refused to compensate me in any way shape or form because they claimed that if I have to catch another flight with another airline, that is not their problem. You are an airline, your job is to get me from point A to point B, how you are refusing to do that is beyond me. I was then forced to reschedule the flight I had missed for another day, but of course I arrive back in Toronto and United Airlines had left my luggage at Houston airport. When I retrieved my luggage the following day, a wheel had been broken, forcing me to purchase another suitcase for the flight I had rescheduled. Not happy.";NEGATIVE

We next had the misfortune of meeting the operations manager for United in Denver.

I told him that my bag was compliant but that I had my handbag stacked on top which made it look bigger. He held up the line and made me place the bag in the size checker. I took out my shower shoes which I had just placed in the front pocket and he tried to publicly humiliate me as if I were senile if my bag at the gate. My husband told him that I literally just put them in the front pocket because they were in my hand bag and he was so rude and obnoxious to my husband whom never speaks and is a proper gentleman. Due to Inited’s notorious treatment of its customers, I told my husband it was not worth it and let’s just let her get on with it as my bag clearly fit and was compliant with regulations.

The 787's business class arrangement is a bit better than that of the 777, but still lags behind the comfort of some of its competitors. Still, the food has been upgraded somewhat, but gone are some of the original Polaris amenities - ie., the second pillow, the bloody mary carts, etc. Slippers must be asked for. Overall it was comfortable with generally good service. Entertainment choices are immense. My main course, ravioli, was a bit too undercooked for my taste. I did not take the second meal, but it looked quite tasty. My only real complaint here would be the state of the toilet which was a mess within a couple hours of takeoff. Obviously no crew member ever looked. But it would be nice if United had someone straighten up the toilet at least once during the flight.";POSITIVE

They told me I still might make my connecting flight from Denver to OKC, but if not, they would switch my flight to Tulsa which took off 35 minutes later. She said they'd take care of everything mid-air. They told us on the plane there would be CS reps to help us with our connections. It was one guy who simply asked where you were going and he'd direct you to the gate. I walked 30+ gates away to get to my connecting flight. They didn't have me in the system, and didn't have my luggage transferred. He sent me back to a United customer service desk that turned out to be closed when I got there. He closed the gate, so I couldn't make Tulsa either. So I had to go back 30 gates, stand in line for 2 hours, and be told I wouldn't be able to get to OKC until about 12:30. There were so many people in the customer service line, not just people from our flight. I didn't see this with any other airline as I walked through DIA. Once I finally got through the long line, the lady at the Customer Service desk was friendly and helpful as she could be given the circumstances, but United really blew it and I missed my mother's funeral.

Newark was cancelling and delaying flights left and right. United rebooked me onto a flight to Norfolk 30 hours later and I was not going to waste a day in Newark. My fiance said he would drive to Richmond to come get me if I could book a flight there. First time rebooking to Richmond, the United Service Assistant was very rude and didn't seem to care about my situation. Ripped up my luggage tag, as it was on the back of my boarding pass, even though I had asked for it back and rebooked me on a flight to Richmond that left at 6.30. It was 6.20. Had to run down to the shuttle to get from Terminal C to Terminal A in order to get to my gate. Plane was gone by the time I got there. Stood in another customer service line to get onto another flight to Richmond. This service assistant was a lot more helpful and seemed like he cared. So thank you to him. Got me booked onto the next flight out to Richmond that night. Got to Richmond and my luggage was not there. Spoke to a luggage assistant there who was really kind and was able to locate my luggage without the luggage tag. Luggage was in Newark still and I could expect to see it delivered the following morning. I've been here for 2 days now and still do not have my luggage. Everytime I check or call the number all I'm told is that ""staff are still in the process of locating my luggage"". What happened? It feels like after I landed in Newark and the flights to Norfolk were cancelled that my luggage just got tossed aside somewhere and now they can't find it. That or it feels like it's not a priority to them. Maybe I'm being selfish, but I literally only have the clothes on my back and what was in my carry-on with me. I have prescriptions in my luggage that I'm going without. I leave in 3 weeks, so I hope to have my luggage by then. But I'm considering cancelling and rebooking my return trip with someone else because I don't want to have to relive this nightmare again. Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.";NEGATIVE

The IFE started to glitch out during the safety video, so the crew did a manual demonstration and also let us use the IFE for free (United normally charges for it). The service started a bit late but when it did the crew was friendly and energetic. I felt welcomed and it made my flight that much better. The legroom in Economy+ is excellent, it is almost 10 extra inches than regular economy - well worth the money! The seats were a bit tight in width but other than that, very comfortable.

A couple days before our flight to Denver which was supposed to connect us to Vegas, United Airlines decided to switch our connecting flight and not update us about the change in connecting flights. Our new connecting flight was now leaving out of Washington D.C ten minutes after we were supposed to land. 1) Nobody can get off a plane and sprint down the terminal to board. 2) Our first flight out of Newark was delayed so our connecting flight left before we even landed in D.C. Now we have lost a day of vacation and hotel reservations that we can’t get a refund. We received a response from a United rep saying we could get more leg room on our next connecting flight, which is only 1 hour. I lost a day of vacation and only get maybe an extra foot of leg room on a one hour flight? No thank you.

Delayed flights caused me to miss my connecting flights and have to rebook another flight. Delayed flights are one thing that I am capable of letting go. However, they didn't even load my bag on a flight home. When i asked about it they simply said ""Oh it was supposed to come on an earlier flight but it got canceled."" Okay so it was just forgotten? It feels like if the bags don't go as originally planned they get tossed somewhere and forgotten until I have to call them multiple times. Still currently waiting for my checked bag to come here on the next flight from Newark to Virginia. I was told it would be coming on flight 4925 - that flight was this morning. It's still in Newark. And I asked if they can be sure if my bag will make it on the next flight this afternoon, but they can't even confirm that. I'll just have to wait until they feel like sending it on the next flight. Who knows when that is. Completely terrible experience that I have never had before.  I suppose you pay for what you get. terrible service.";NEGATIVE

It will then alert you when an airline has dropped ticket prices. When I called United to change my ticket to use for another day, I fully expected to pay the usual $125.00 change fee. I was told that since I used the Hopper app, which they consider to be a travel agency, that I was going to be charged $200.00 along with $125.00 change fee. For a total of $325.00.

united-airlines;2018-04-02;" |  Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City with a change of planes in San Francisco to SLC (1 hr 32 min.) Airline travel is hard enough without punitive agents. On March 31 we were making a coast-to-coast trip after our cruise. Our return tickets from Fort Lauderdale to Salt Lake City were with United purchased through Expedia. Our day started at 4 am. Most airlines that I know of allow a carry on and a personal item policy. We chose the United flight because it got us back at a decent hour so we could make the 3.5-hour drive back to our home in Idaho. We had tried to print our boarding passes online with the ship’s computer/printer but were unable to with the directive we would have to see an agent at the airport. We were informed, when were arrived at the airport, that we would have to check our carry on bags because of the nature of the ticket we purchased. We weren't happy about it but did so at the extra cost of $25 a bag. We had purchased a basic economy flight ticket so that did not allow a carry on. We were placed in the very back row 38 and had a bumpy and straight-backed ride for over 6 hours. Fair enough. On arriving at San Francisco for our transfer flight of an hour and a half to SLC we had something to eat and waited. We were the last passengers to board the plane. As we were being checked in the United Agent stopped my wife. He/she said the carry on bag of my wife needed to be checked even though we had just gotten off a United jet of the same size and model so there was no question that it fit under the seat and that is the criteria that was listed by Expedia and United: “Carry-on bags are limited to one personal item that fits under the seat in front of you.” I have to interject here that my wife has used this same personal carry on bag for over 20 years of flying with all the major airlines United, Delta, American, Alaskan, and Frontier. No airline agent of flight attendant had ever given her a problem because of its size or dimensions (9x9x18). It always fit easily under the seat, even with the small computer planes that have much shorter routes with much smaller jets. My wife was forced to give up her personal bag before she could board the flight. My wife sent me on to board since my protests were falling on deaf ears. But after taking about 10 steps I turned around and went back to ask the agent if this had anything to do with the ticket we had purchased through Expedia? She/he said yes. So I went to board. My wife boarded about 3-5 minutes later and when she reached our back seats she was seething. She told me to guess what they had charged her to check her personal bag. I guessed $25? No. $50? No. She was charged $175.00! She told me she had felt bullied and belittled by what took place. This whole experience has soured us both towards flying with United Airlines. We have frequent flyer numbers with the airlines and this incident was completely out of character for the airlines that tout the “Friendly Skies”. It was illogical and unprofessional to treat loyal customers in that way.";NEGATIVE

We asked at the gate to help us to seat together, explaining that it’s easier to handle our son together, but nobody bothered, basically, we were told, that’s our issue. In the plane my son has tantrum with crying, we tried to talk to other passengers, asking if there is a way to switch, no luck. Flight attendants just pass by saying “You are his mom, deal with it”, threatening to stop the plane taking off if I couldn’t have him seated. My explanation that I need at least my husband’s help or the window seat (preferably the second) are ignored. Finally, there is one very nice flight attendant (the only one who seems to care about passengers) who was able to switch us to the window seats, we calmed down our son and he fell asleep. Other flight attendants gave us really bad attitude, as if being a parent means to have a magic wand that will make a 3-year old behave like an adult and quietly sit through the 7-hour flight. In addition, there was no child meal that I ordered, and he refused to eat whatever they offered for adults (the food looked awful), so he had only muffin and a couple of cookies during the entire flight.

A burger is not an attractive option for a first class meal. Especially one with just cheese as a topping, and no lettuce, tomato, onion or anything. Plus I don’t eat meat, so I was thoroughly disappointed. Worse was the return flight. The seat, tray table and armrest was absolutely filthy. I did not feel comfortable sitting in the seat. It looked like it hadn’t been cleaned in days. Old food crumbs, hair, dust was prevalent. Could not believe United let this happen. I worked my way up in life to enjoy luxury. This ain’t luxury.

united-airlines;2018-03-31;" |  Nashville to Amsterdam via Washington-Dulles. We will never fly United again. Due to a mechanical failure, we were asked to get off our flight from IAD-AMS after an hour on the tarmac. We were then asked to check back at the gate in an hour for a status update, at which point they told us to check back in another two and a half hours, though they were already pulling our bags off the plane. It was obvious the flight was not going to take off, but we were strung along for three hours. When it was finally cancelled, we were asked to walk a half a mile from service desk at D15 to C20. Once there we waited for yet another hour in line. Here is where it got absurd…At the desk the United Service Rep printed out a hotel and 6 meal vouchers for us. While they are printing, our Rep and the other customer service reps were looking at the vouchers and talking about the fact they just said ""invoice"" on them next to payment method and how that was not normal. The manager comes out and tells them that ""it will be fine and just keep printing them."" The Rep hands the vouchers to us and away we go. We wait in line for the shuttle then wait in line for the Westin service desk only to find out the vouchers do not work since there is no credit card associated with them or no established account with the Westin!!! After waiting to get on the phone with one of the United service reps at Dulles, the rep tells us we must go back to the airport to pick up a new voucher with a number! Fortunately Westin knows how to provide Customer service and convinces the United Rep at Dulles to just send over some form via email and puts us up even without a payment method. This negotiation lasted two hours. At this point we have been traveling for 11 hours with only 1 hour in flight. Also none of our food vouchers work at the hotel for the same reason. The next morning we find out the United has not yet sent the form over or paid Westin for our stay. This is the third United flight I have taken in the last 2 months that has either been overbooked or cancel by mechanical failure. United flights are unreliable and their customer service is appalling. All they do is pass the blame and never resolve the issues they have caused. I urge you to not fly them and hopefully one day their awful customer service will put them out of business.";NEGATIVE

Considering that I needed to get to Richmond early, I asked if there were any other options. Spoke with multiple United employees and their response was to drive the rest of the way. I had no choice, so I decided to rent a car. Then I was told they would not get my luggage off the plane, even considering the plane was going to be there for 5 hours. After speaking to multiple employees, I luckily found one that retrieved my bag. Now on my return, i drive to Richmond airport and then receive a text telling my that my flight from Richmond to Washington Dulles is delayed 3 hours and I would not make my flight back to Detroit. Luckily I had not returned my rental car yet, I park and go in to speak to an agent. Once again, nothing they can do. I have to switch my rental location back to Washington Dulles and drive there as fast as I can to make my flight back home. No options offered, no offer to cover my rental cost, nothing - dont fly United.";NEGATIVE

On both our flights to NC and returning to MT we were spread out between multiple rows and not able to sit together. In addition we were all in the middle seats of the various rows.

I was told my flight was cancelled due to weather condition at the counter when I was trying to check, and they said they sent me a text, which I received during my check in. I asked the lady who works at the Untied Counter, what are the alternative since the flight is cancelled, she told me I can take another flight which is about 2 hours away (Burbank CA), or come back tomorrow, I asked her how do I get to Burbank, she told me ""I don't know, I don't deal with transportation."" Then I asked her ""Am I going to get reimbursement?"" she replied: ""I only check you in, I don't know about reimbursement, you should call United."" I was on a business trip and my schedule was tight, and as I insist on a solution, at the next counter, China Airline's employee felt bad and helped me to found a solution to fly from the same airport going to San Francisco. As I was waiting for my flight, I tried to contact United, I was trying to get an idea of the situation of my reimbursement, and was on queries for 2 hours, until I got on the plane. On the way back, as I got to the counter for check in, United Airline employee told me that my flight was cancelled because they put me on the Burbank flight (without my approval) and since I did not show up on the flight, they cancelled my round trip. They said they tried to contact me and maybe because I was in the sky when they called, but since I didn't call them back, I am liable for this result. At the counter I just wanted to go home and told them I just want to buy a ticket now (I already told my friends when to pick me up, and unlike United, I don't want to change what was schedule.) And the lady was like you can buy it with your phone. I insisted on her booking the ticket for me (I didn’t want to have the risk of, where I brought a ticket online and the counter told me they can't find it) then she tried to book me for about 10 minutes and told me ""I am going to have to stop booking for you since you are about to past the 30 minutes limit to board the flight."" And Later on I found out the person who is ""more"" familiar with the ticketing was on lunch. The most disgusting part is their attitude and the situation they put you in, ""I am not responsible for your schedule."" ""You didn't show up for your flight,"" ""I am not in charge of reimbursement,"" ""you should have booked your ticket online."" Never ever United.";NEGATIVE

They have always been helpful when we found ourselves in a quandary and over the years I remember only one incident where I was upset about the quality of customer service when dealing with United employees. Today United came through for me again, far above and beyond the call of fair customer service: my FF status expired in Feb as I had a slow travel year in 2017 and I also missed the March 11th deadline for purchasing a reinsted status, however, a very pleasant and helpful customer rep went the extra mile for me and requested an exception since I’ve been a loyal customer for years - and not only did United reinstate my silver status but they did it for free ($680 value as quoted to me in March). United has my loyalty!";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2018-03-25;" |  Bozeman to Tampa via Houston. United Airlines has to be by far the worst airline ever.  They nickel and dime you for everything and then do not provide what you paid for.  Every employee/representative states""there's nothing I could do (for their own mistake and situation they have created).  Paid extra per passenger to be able to pre-select my seats and guarantee that I would sit with my husband for our long flights (I have developed anxiety with flying).  Paid for my checked bags when booking my flights. I check in to my flight the evening before my flight,  since I do not bring a printer on vacation,  I chose electronic boarding passes.  All info was good, name, correct flight and bags. Once at the airport, an agent told me we had re-check in to get out luggage tags.  We insisted that we were already checked-in with luggage paid for.   She made us use the kiosk, and when I checked in, my name was changed to 'Olivia'.  So now my boarding pass does not match my ID, and they were charging us again for bags I already paid for.  At the counter, a call was placed to United by the ticket agent about the name change.  The person at the other end of the phone stated that another agent had been in my record earlier that day.  That agent denied changing my record.  My name was corrected, a new boarding pass issued,  but no seat assigned.  When we got to the gate, they re-assigned me to s seat different than the one I had paid extra to select at booking, and I was no longer sitting with my husband.  We asked to get my seat back that was assigned to me 45 minutes earlier, but they could not because my original seat was given away. Once on the plane, the bitch who got the seat with my husband would not move.  I ended up in the aisle seat in the last row....by the bathrooms in a seat that does not recline. To top it off, instead of offering to help, the flight attendant told me she was going to escort me off the flight for being upset. United airlines charges over the top prices, charge for everything and do not provide service.  Staff is rude, not helpful and are trained to answer ""there is nothing I can do"".  The bottom line is:  I will take your money, not provided what you paid for, be unhelpful and rude to you.  Then, you are held hostage and threatened to be taken off your flight when you let then know you want what you paid for. United -Tampa to Bozeman MT: $1500 for 2.  Extra charge for seat selection and bags. Delta- Tampa to SLC: $700 for 2. Extra charge for seat selection and luggage. American - Tampa to Syracuse: $490  for 2.  No extra charge for seat selection. United Airlines is a rip-off with very poor accountability and customer service.  Will pay more with another airline next time.  Very disappointed and United will not fix this. I feel like I was robbed. They do not care about the paying customer once you have given them your money. We will never fly with them again. Flight attendants are unhappy and rude, do not assist for anything. Ticket agents are incompetent and stressed.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-03-25;" |  San Francisco to Boise. I was scheduled for a flight with United Airlines on 3/20/2018. However, the flight was cancelled due to weather condition (which is understandable), but be reminded that United Airlines do not offer any compensation for weather-related cancellations. Not even a meal for >24hr delay. I got onto another United flight the following day, and arrived with a damaged luggage. The baggage service at the airport was not willing to do anything about it, but then mentioned that they will send the bag to a 3rd party in Texas for repair, and I will be contacted by the 3rd party. Two days later, I received a call from United to pick-up my bag at the airport and it never went for a repair. Nothing happened. But it is United, do not expect any customer service whatsoever. United has written rules and fine prints to protect themselves from paying compensation to passengers in all situations, so understand that you are handing over your money without any guarantee of basic service or protection in return. Again, avoid United Airlines at all cost -and remember this for many years to come (it was my mistake to forget past incidents with United many years ago and gave them another chance). A few hundred dollars spent on flight ticket may end up costing you over >$1000 in incurred costs during delays, lost time, as well as damages to your property.";NEGATIVE

I struggled to get to the airport for a 5:30 am flight and they eagerly switched to a more direct flight, “they were doing me a favor”. It meant I had to be at the Mexican airport 3 hours longer and my wait in Newark was going to be 5 hours and I know they were looking to free up seats on the flight I was on originally. I also had an exit isle seat on the flight I was moved from. It would have been all fine if someone just said ""thank you for being flexible and helping us out” but instead they tried to make it sound like they were doing me a favor. Further annoyed by the unfriendly 2 female attendants for the flight. Simply just not friendly. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-03-23;" | Manila to Colorado Springs via Guam / Honolulu. Worst flights I have ever experienced. Flight to Guam, we were seated and asked the flight attendant if he could put my wife's purse in bin above us, he gave me a dirty look and shut the bin. I asked him again and he finally took it acting as if it was an issue for him. The flight from Honolulu to Denver was horrible, the seats are too narrow. When we boarded we were in 17D and 17E. When I went to put my one carry on bag in the bins above my seat they were full, and the flight attendant gave me a dirty look and said to put it in a bin behind me. This meant I had to put it about 7 rows behind me. The result was when we landed, I had to wait for everyone to leave plane before I got to get my carry on. The reason the bin above me was full was the flight attendant allowed the couple to our left to use two bins for their carry on baggage. When I pay for a ticket I expect to be able to stow at least one carry on above me in the bin. My opinion was the flight attendant could not care less. The other problem is the seats are about 17"" wide and have little recline. I think the management at United needs to try flying and sitting in one of these seats for a 7 hour flight and see how they like it. Overall the service and seating was horrible. If you fly to Asia, I would recommend JAL or ANA as they have great seats and service, plus they provide an excellent meal.";NEGATIVE

Missed the last flight and had to spend a whole day in Denver till the following night. After all of that expense we return the next day to find out they have no crew for that flight. So here we sit again. June 2017 they bumped our seats and we missed our own wedding. We don’t care anymore about price. We are going to take our business else where from now on. They are a ridiculous bunch of slackers. In one year we have missed our own wedding In Kauai. And now our granddaughters first birthday. Atrocious I say.

However snacks (except for one tiny bag of pretzels) and meals were only available for purchase at high prices. Maybe I’m just conditioned to the high standards of Delta and American and expect to have at least a substantial snack on any flight longer than three hours. Additionally, in flight entertainment was not free, but my monitor was not working anyways. Finally, seat comfort is not great. The head rest pushes ones head forward and makes sitting for 4 hours quite uncomfortable. Overall, I’m not impressed.

I bought another internet packet for the entire flight and got disconnected for the second time.

My 4 wheeler luggage could not fit into the overhead compartment (best to bring a small briefcase or backpack next time) and had to be put in the cargo hold. The process of taking the luggage was pretty unusual (we were not given any tags and had to queue out near the door cluttering the exit). The business class seem more spacious at it has a 1-2 config instead of the 2-2 in economy. The guy next to me was a pretty big size to the point I just didnt bother even putting my arm on the armrest. The service was pretty good in my opinion, polite but not out of the ordinary.

united-airlines;2018-03-18;" |  Newark to Boston was extremely problematic. I had boarded the plane and was seated when a man said to the nearby flight attendant that someone was sitting in his seat. The attendant said to me, “I need to see your boarding pass”. Confused, I asked why. She said, “You’re in the wrong seat”, in a rude and urgent tone. I explained to her that I would need to look through my emails to find my original boarding pass. She was rushing me, told me she needed to board all other passengers, and that I needed to hurry up even though she just told me to do this. I showed her my pass from the first leg of the flight. This made her even more on edge and provoked since it was not the right pass. I then found the pass for the current flight and showed it to her. She condescendingly asking, “And this is for the flight now?”, as she refused to read the pass for herself. I said yes and continued to point to the seats me and my friend were assigned listed on the pass. Without reading the pass at all she pointed to my seat and said, “You’re in the wrong seat. You need to move, you’re in the wrong seat”. She was unfriendly, unrelenting, and very angry at me. A man sitting at the window spoke up and said that he was actually in the wrong seat and it was his fault. The passenger that originally asked for help from to the flight attendant, was at this point, visibly uncomfortable by how the flight attendant was harassing nearby passengers and said it didn’t matter where he sat he didn’t care anymore. I ultimately was in the right seat the entire time. However, I was the only passenger the attendant interrogated rudely and angrily. She did not apologize and looked extremely annoyed after this all occurred. Scared that I would be kicked off the plane if I spoke up, I left without receiving any apology from her what so ever. I felt nervous, uncomfortable, upset, and victimized. Later in the flight, another attendant walked up to my seat. She yelled at me to put my seat fully up, two times in a row. I was shocked because I had never put my seat down in the first place. I looked up at her and she said this to me again while telling me to press the button to put the seat up. I pressed the button and the seat didn’t move at all because it was always fully straight. I said to her, “It is fully up”. She said extremely shortly, “I am allowed to tell you to put it up. That is my job.” Then proceeded to glare at me. I said “that’s fine”. And she rolled her eyes at me. She did not treat any other passengers on board like this except for me. I felt treated unfairly and felt like I could not speak up or I’d be dragged off the plane. In both instances, I cooperated, did nothing wrong in the first place and was severely harassed by multiple flight attendants on board. This was my first time flying with United Airlines and I would never go back. What a terrible end to a great vacation. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-03-18; | Houston to Seattle. I paid for First Class and was disappointed in the mediocre food quality and limited selection of beverages. The only red wine available was mediocre-to-bad and came ice cold in a glass. no way of knowing what was being poured. The FA simply said that there was a red and a white. I don't eat meat and the only two meal options were meat so I ended up eating rice. I would have picked the chicken out of the Cobb Salad but they had run out of that by the time they got to me in row 3 (of 6 rows). The small piece of cheesecake was convenience-store quality. I wondered if United had chosen to skimp on food quality and quantity as a cost cutting measure. I honestly thought that paying for a First Class seat would bring great service and relieve me from the unpleasant economy situation of United. It real only brought me up to what a normal economy experience might be.;NEGATIVE

When I got out of immigration, someone from United was waiting for me asking if I’m going to DFW. I said yes. They checked my bag. Then, they changed the departure gate. I spent 10 minutes in the airport running to get to the new gate. When I finally get to the gate 10 minutes before departure, the flight attendant says that she can’t let me in. I need to check with customer service. I go to customer service, they rebook me for the next day and do not provide me an hotel. When I fly with Delta, they always provide me hotel when it’s their fault and I will spend the night. Also, we left from Punta Cana 15 minutes after departure because we were waiting for some customers. And, when we got to Washington, we waited 5-10 minutes before going to the gate. Thus, I lost in total 20-25 minutes because of the airline and they don’t want to get me hotel saying it’s not their fault I spent a long time at immigration. Meanwhile, I could have make my flight if I did not lose those 20 minutes. Thank you United. I’m not gonna flight with you anymore! I am really upset.";NEGATIVE

Everything was fine until another lady approached and said are you all together and she said our bags could not go on. I have flown all over the world with my family and these bags.

At the desk, when they charge you because they don't allow carry on bags, the employees do not want anything to do with you, except take your money for a bag that should be allowed as a carry on anyways.  At the gate, when they assign you a seat, they don't even look at you. I guess it makes sense with an airline that creates class warfare in the main cabin of the plane. They have about three different classes of ticket for the passengers who are all sitting in the same section on the plane. And they treat those who has a Basic Economy ticket like farm animals. If not, worse. You have to pay wifi, pay if you want a tiny bag of food, pay to check a bag that should be carry on, and all while they not caring about you at all. They have older planes, the ones that other airlines retired years ago, so they're excessively cramped, and dirty, and little things on the seats and in the aisles are broken or falling all. They consistently oversell their flights, so you may be asked to give up your seat.  Since their ticket prices aren't even cheaper than most, I'll be much more happy paying in the same price range to fly a different airline which allows a carry on bag, provides free wifi, allows you to pick your seat, and doesn't treat you like pond scum. United Airlines should be ashamed.";NEGATIVE

Flight was late taking off for no reason they could give us. We sat on the plane ready for take off an hour before leaving but they assured all of us going to ABQ would make our connecting flight. We landed get to the gate in SFO and they had just shut the door. There was 8 of us who they would not let on. When I called into customer care they would get us there till almost 24 hours later with a flight that would have another connection so who knows if we would have made that. I asked if there was a fight I could get on with another airline that would get me there that night as I needed to be. She looked and said no. I found one on AK Airlines and she said she couldn’t book with them only American. I asked about getting a reimbursement on my ticket with United and she said as long as I didn’t get on the next flight with them. Was on the phone waiting to talk to manager and I got hung up on. I purchase ticket with AK Airlines that can get me there that day. Call back as I’m walking to their gates. He only refunded me half the ticket since I used the other half. Stated I would have to email a complaint to get other part of ticket back. Well after months of emails and calling I have not received the other half back or anything towards that AK Airlines ticket. They say there is nothing they can do. All I was asking for was $35 dollars! Plus when I got to the AK Airlines gate United had put one lady on that flight so they could have done it. Long story short horrible customer service with no results except a $50 off my next flight with them. I will never fly them again so told them I’m not interested in that!;NEGATIVE

To top it off, I was confronted about my seating on what amounted to be a half-full flight and forced to sit in the back even with empty seats around. Disgraceful.

united-airlines;2018-03-12;" |  My husband and I flew from Newark to Las Vegas. We purchased the tickets a few months before the flight and I was advised to contact United to inform them of my pet allergies. I called 10 days before the flight and was told that there were no animals booked for either direction. I was then told to call back 24 hours prior to the flight as there were a few available seats and the pet policy requires 48 hour prior notification. I called back and was offered a seat in the pet-free area (for $200 more each direction) which I declined as there were no pets booked and we were in the home stretch, the 48 hour notification deadline. I was told to notify the gate agent on arrival. At the airport my bag was pulled for inspection as they x-rayed my book and did a thorough check on my EpiPen. When we finally arrived I let the agent at the gate know about my allergies and was informed that he didn’t know if there were any animals on the flight. He told me that it was policy to book anyone with allergies on the next available flight if there were pets onboard. I asked if the next flight had any pets booked as my husband tried desperately to pull me away from the counter but, not before I heard the agent reply that he didn’t know. He did know that my husband and I would be seated in separate rows, 15 rows difference to be exact. As we boarded, our carry on was removed and banished to the bowels of the plane. I said farewell to my luggage and husband, got seated, cracked my book, and took a deep breath. That’s when I began giving my seat mate some serious side-eye to see if she was covered in cat hair as I scratched at my hives and waved away pet fur. I took 2 Benadryl and started hitting the bottle, of eye drops that is. Hour fours, two more Benadryl (that’s four if you’re counting) and a full bladder. I stood up to use the restroom and peered over the seat directly in front of me and that’s when I see it. A stressed out, full shed-mode, Pomeranian sitting on his owners lap. He pants as his owner strokes his fur creating the snow globe from hell. Who knew sitting 15 rows away from your husband would come in handy. I passed the baton (bottle of pills and tissues cause he’s allergic to dogs too) and ran to the critter free zone. To be fair, I am an animal lover but, the pet policies have to be addressed. I’m not the only allergy sufferer and you’ll have a hard time convincing me that this particular dog was a seeing eye dog, a seizure dog, a PTSD pooch or anything but the fluffy family pet. I followed the airlines rules and look where it got me, the run around, and a trip to urgent care for a sinus infection. Oh yeah, crazy small seats, no WiFi, piss poor customer service!

When I went to do online check in 24 hours to flight, I learned I had to check my small suitcase, that I have always carried on before. I travel very light. One small carry on and one backpack. I was told I was not allowed the suitcase and had to check it and pay $25 each leg. Ridiculous. I then had to wait in baggage claim, which I never had to do before. I’ve decided I will not be flying United again for this very reason. This change in policy is taking you out of the market as compared to other airlines. People that travel light typically go economy, and they travel light to avoid delays like waiting in baggage claim. Bad decision United.";NEGATIVE

Our flight lanes on schedule, as soon as we departed the plane I asked customer service if we were going to miss our flight. They immediately confirmed before going through customs or security. At this point we had already traveled for 21 consecutive hours, this additional delay increased our total travel time from 23 hours to 30 hours. Especially tough when traveling with an infant. I believe United was fully aware that we wouldn’t be able to make our connecting flight but did not notify us because we would have canceled our tickets. On the other hand, if it would have lead to us staying in a hotel for 1-2 nights I believe United would have let us know. Basically they are only out to protest their bottom dollar and have no consideration for the inconvenience they caused. We declined the $50 travel voucher they offered and will not be using United again.";NEGATIVE

The gate was still open with passengers loading, the ticket agents said to see the gate attendant to myself and the other 2 folks who were also connecting(with a line of people there). After several minutes (and the gate was still open) the agent finally looked up my boarding pass and said they had actually sold my full fare first class ticket to someone else, because they thought our flight would be too late! The agent was very curt and rude, offered no compensation, he put me on the next flight 4+ hours later in a bad coach seat next to a screaming baby with no food service on an evening 5.5 hr flight! That flight by the way also did not take off on-time as we sat on the aircraft for another 50 extra min making it a nearly 7 hr flight time. not the first terrible flight on United either.";NEGATIVE

Overall cleanliness and condition of plane was disgraceful and we were apparently on a new Boeing 787.

Our flight was suppose to be at 11am but was delayed until 3:30 because of a “technical issue”. Shockingly there was no mechanic at this airport to fix the issue so one had to come from Orlando which took 4hrs. Older people who were waiting for news in wheelchairs were treated with disregard. New people were put on this plane by the airline only to face this grueling experience. Finally, after almost 5hrs of waiting, the flight was cancelled. Completely disgusted with the unprofessionalism and lack of care that took place. Will never fly United again.";NEGATIVE

They have taken away the option to check in online from passengers that don't carry additional luggage. Customers with only a personal item must now check-in in person. What a way to increase efficiency and wait lines. I now get to spend more time away from my personal life and at their terrible terminals.

In other words they are going to squeeze you to the point of missing your flight in order to get that extra baggage fee. Well, they just lost my future business. Goodbye and good riddance United.

The representative I spoke with canceled my flight without confirmation and prevented me from flying out to my destination on time.

united-airlines;2018-03-07;" | Original flight canceled due to weather. Understanding this creates havoc. App was good at sending message, but contacting a human to see what options were took over an hour on hold. Re booking direct flight was not possible. Our diversion through Houston worked out OK, but staff along the way were extremely rude and the treatment of basic economy class passenger is like they are dirt. I read and tried to follow the luggage rules. I paid $50 for the privledge of checking two bags. My wife and I consolidated into one small carry-on bag. I was among the last group to board, with everyone else carrying much larger bags aboard when a gate agent yelled at me to stop and demand I pay a $50 dollar fee to gate check. When I told her I had paid the fee online for two bags, she ""let me go with a warning"" but told me to leave bag unattended at the gate (which I refused to do) this is against every announcement and safety procedure airports have. I took it with me to the plane, and asked a stewardess if I should check it at the door. She was friendly, and I was allowed to leave luggage where at least an airline baggage handler took it directly and joked he would have it in New Orleans before I got there. The plane was filthy, dirty tissues in the safety card pocket. Trash on the floor, wrappers and cellophane. PA system didn't work. No internet on this flight (broken). The short hop flight from Houston to New Orleans was about as tight as they can make it (I'm 6'2""). I find it hard to believe this passes the safety rules for evacuation speed, these seats are so close. The message from the airline is clear - if you opt for basic economy, we will make your trip so bad. A fellow traveler joked he had more legroom in the toilet and was tempted to hide out sitting in there for the rest of flight. So, I tried to follow all the rules. I am a pretty easy going person, compliant with others. But this experience was pretty awful.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-03-06;" |  Houston to New York. Don't have much to say beyond what everyone has basically come to expect of United: minimal amenities, non-existent customer service, and generally quality suitable for a 3rd world country airline. On the flight  they charge extra for everything, just like the low-cost airline that they are, with the exception of 1 drink and ""free entertainment"" if you bring your own device. Of course, they don't provide a port for charging said device, and also don't actually let you watch most of their entertainment unless you install some software, which on a Mac simply doesn't work (it keeps asking for Flash even if you install it), and on a mobile device requires downloading their app, for which you need Wi-Fi, which, who'd have guessed, you have to pay for. As for the very limited selection of movies that don't require said software, they still don't work on a computer, but on a mobile device are just close enough to working that you'll spend the majority of the flight (not remotely an exaggeration) staring at a frozen screen as it presumably buffers for 15-20 minutes at a time. I suppose the only thing setting this United flight apart is that this time we flew with their new ""Basic Economy"" concept, where for more or less the same price, they manage to exceed even their normal standards of how clear they can make their contempt for you as a passenger (to be honest, little difference beyond disallowing even carry-ons, but they do make sure to constantly remind you of it, which is especially egregious considering that's something even the low-cost airlines allow).";NEGATIVE

One employee would tell us that our bags would be fine to carry On, while another would tell us that we'd have to check them, just minutes before boarding when it was already too late. We ended up being stuck in San Francisco, CA and needed to just take the second leg of our trip instead of starting with Bakersfield to San Fran, San Fran to Kansas City because we ended up being stuck in San Fram due to a family emergency. We called customer service and explained the situation to which they replied that our entire flight would have to be cancelled due to a ""No show"" since we wouldn't be on the bakersfield to San Fran flight. We explained the situation again and stated that we'd still be paying for the flight but just wouldn't be on it. They eventually said that they got it taken care of and that we could take the San Fran to Kansas City flight and skip Bakersfield so we were under the impression that everything was taken care of. The next day (the day before the flight), we went to check in to our flights and were unable to do so on the United Airlines app on our phones. We called customer service again and were told that our flight was cancelled completely and that we were going to owe $380 each plus what we had already paid for our flights in order to get them reinstated due to ""fare changes"" and we would have to take the Bakersfield to San Fran connection again. We explained again that this was not possible and what we were told the day before about not having to take the bakersfield part of the flight and that we were told everything was taken care of. The customer service representative stated there was nothing they could do and that we'd have to pay the fee and take the connecting flight if we wanted to make it back to KC. When asked to speak with a manager we were placed on hold for almost 30 minutes and then they came back to tell us that it was a mistake on their end and we were able to take San Fran to KC with no additional charges. While on the San Fran flight the flight attendant was extremely rude. There was a line of people trying to board and she attempted to push past me to close one of the overhead compartments. I asked her if she could wait until we sat down and she said, ""I need to close these now! They're full! Back up for a minute"" In a very brisk and rude manner. She was slamming the doors on the compartments and pushing past people. A couple minutes later when she seemed to be over her tirade, another gentleman on the plane asked her if she was having a rough day. She stated, ""I left something expensive on one of the other planes and they wouldn't give it back."" He said, ""I'm sorry to hear that I hope your day gets better."" To which she then continued to go slam more of the overhead compartments and order the passengers around. My entire United Airlines experience has been awful and we will not be using them again.

United does it again, I booked an aisle seat as I tend to get claustrophobic cramped against a window for any long flights. United changed my seat to a window. As usual their customer service was very poor. I don’t understand why when you book a specific seat 2 weeks in advance that the choose to move a person to a worse seat.

united-airlines;2018-02-26; | United has always let me down whenever I have flown with them. They are usually delayed and had me wait over two hours for a flight before. So when I was going home by them again I accepted that it wasn’t going to be a fun trip. I didn’t know it was going to be this bad. First off my flight started off late and the plane got to the airport 20 minutes later then we should have. They did not tell us why we were late though. Not only was it late but we had to wait longer than necessary to get our carry-on luggage that wouldn’t fit on the actual plane. Due to all of this we missed our connecting flight. When we finally found the right gate (since it was switched on us at least twice) the flight had already boarded and the door closed. The attendant at the desk was rude and condenscending when she told us that it was closed and the plane left. We proceeded to wait in the customer service line for two hours in order to talk to a rep who didn’t know anything and had to ask her supervisor on every little question. She tried to figure out why the flight was late but found no reason or explanation why. She said yes the flight was delayed but since there was no reason for it she could not get us a hotel room or even a discount on one. The next flight to South Dakota wasn’t until ten the next morning which would have been too late for the event we needed to get to. We asked if we could be refunded and found a flight back to Tulsa. After a lengthy phone call they decided that they can only get us on the next flight back to Tulsa which was at 2pm the next day and if we want to be refunded we will have to call a number and jump through some more hoops even though it’s the airlines fault for us missing our connecting. We asked if we could possibly fly back on Sunday. Since we were already in Denver we didn’t want to shoot our entire weekend down the drain. She replied with a no due to policy. So here we are in the Denver airport at 10.30 at night with no luggage food or a room. We are missing a baptism. With how we were treated and hurt I am now going to make every effort to never fly United again. I will also never recommend this airline. ;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-02-26;" |  Montreal to New York with United, connecting to Avianca and Tam to Sao Paulo / Salvador. My partner and I won't fly again with United Airlines. First of all, they started by ""forgetting"" to reimburse us a pair of tickets (worth more than 3000$), even after we called to make sure we had not been ticketed. When we had tried to purchase our ticket, they were not able to confirm to us our tickets within 24 hours, so their policy was that our tickets would be canceled - we would not be charged. We took extra precautions by calling them to make sure we were not charged, and were reassured that we would not be charged. One month later we find out in our credit card statement that we had actually been charged. This is not a mistake of charging 10$ extra to costumers, it's more than 3000$! Moreover, we had to wait about 2 weeks to get the full reimbursement once we called them. And lot's of talking over the phone. Second, during our trip, we wanted to change the origin and date of one of our flights. However, when calling United Airlines during multiple days and talking to several agents, some would say we could not change the origin of our ticket. No where on the ticket does it say we cannot change the origin. Also, we spoke to about 5 agents who told us all kinds of different rules and policies (often contradictory) - all with the same end: they would not let us change one of our flights. They told us we had to ""stick to our initial route"" and there were not changes possible. The call center staff is  unprofessional, scattered around the world and all saying different policies, rules, etc. We wasted so much time.

If this is the way they treat customers and make money now, they are digging their grave aggressively. Company like this is really badly managed and have no reputation whatsoever.

Before my first flight departed, I expressed concern to a flight attendant, because there was only 16 minutes from when the flight landed until my next flight started boarding. She stated to me that we would probably be arriving early so there would be enough time for me and they could ask the passengers to remain seated letting me off the plane. Neither these things were true. I get to the gate at LAX three minutes passed when boarding was meant to end. It is isolated and not a single employee nor other passengers are around. I pace around looking for someone but the doors are shut. I rush back to a staffed customer service stand for answers. The woman I had the displeasure of talking to was in ""Customer Service."" Can I have your last name? No. Do you have an employee identification number? I can't give it to you. She calls my gate and discovers the employees were in the jetway. She then continues to bang away on her computer keyboard for several minutes. There was absolutely NO attempt to help me make my flight. She notifies me that the soonest I can leave is not until tomorrow afternoon. I tell that is not going to work for me. She does not care. That was that. What else can you do? Nothing. How else can I get there? You can drive. I openly express my frustration. About how I asked for help from the flight attendant, she does not care. I demand that there must be something else she can do and at this she picks up the phone to call security. She then says to me ""we're done, you are not willing to listen, we're done."" And at this, refuses to help me and sends me away. I come back to her and said that I was going to need a hotel room for the night. She responds with, ""I am not helping you with anything."" You are not going to get me a hotel? She uses this as an opportunity to lecture and chastise me about I should have listened to her and if I wouldn't have left the terminal [to find a human being to help me] then I wouldn't have missed my flight. I have a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder which I am medicated for. This employee caused me to go into a panic attack which I could not breathe and started to black out. I tried explaining to her I have an anxiety disorder to which she responded with, ""yeah I can tell."" It was the most violating and humiliating thing anyone had ever said to me.

united-airlines;2018-02-18; | The worst service ever. I purchased a ticket from Seattle to Syracuse NY with one stop in Chicago to find out when I got to Chicago that the connection flight is delayed by four hours. No apologies at all. They just really don’t care. Last month they cancelled my flight from Syracuse to Seattle going through Chicago causing me a full day delay and added hotel room and rental car cost for one additional day since they did not tell anyone about the cancellation until I got to the airport. Again they don’t care and they refused to reimburse me for the extra night hotel room. I will never ever use this airline again. Avoid them at all costs.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-02-18;" | This airline is ridiculous with their basic economy! It’s not even about no more carry-ons - it’s about not being able to switch to a later flight during a family emergency. I was only flying from NYC to Rochester. I needed to change my return flight to a later date. The original ticket is $150 plus $50 in taxes - makes sense for a 45 minute flight. To change the ticket since it’s “non refundable” - and technically I’m not getting a refund just changing my flight - is a $50 conversion fee and then a $200 fee to switch the ticket! So they’re not helping I’m just buying another, more expensive ticket. Ridiculous. Never flying United again!";NEGATIVE

We had a tail wind and made up about 40 minutes flying time. Tea and coffee was free on the flight. I also was willing to be offloaded but they did not need the extra seat.

So after finally being deplaned because of maintenance problems, I have been re routed to a flight that takes off two hours later, has a four hour layover at my next stop and gets me home after midnight. I've been dropped from first class to economy. And when I asked if there was any sort of compensation for this mess they have created, I was told I can call customer services. I asked to be put on a different airline so I could arrive home sooner as I have to be in the OR at 7 am tomorrow and was told I couldn't. It is unbelievable how you are treated as a paying customer. Why would anyone ever fly?  When asked why they couldn't have figured out these maintenance problems last night we were told that they don't check the plane until shortly before take off.  It's unbelievable!";NEGATIVE

The one who took our bording passes looked at asked us to tell our names by showing each bording pass. We did as she said. But she asked us to repeat it. But we don't know why. My husband repeat it again also said we have to catch the flight at 10.45pm So let us go. (It was almost 10.30) she looked at me and said step back and take off my tiny purse which was hanging my neck and shoulder. So i had to step back and take off my backpack my jackets to take my purse and put it inside. I was just couple steps away from immigration. I know she wanted to make us uncomfortable in front of everyone.  We felt so helpless specialy when we had a sleeping baby with us. This made me so upset during whole flight.

united-airlines;2018-02-05; |  Philadelphia to Washington Dulles. I am very upset at this point. I was scheduled to leave Philadelphia going to Washington then connecting to Atl. Flight 6319 was an hour late getting to Philadelphia. Intead of boarding at 7:25pm to depart at 7:50pm. Flight arrived at 8:35pm and plane took off at 9:08pm. We arrived in Washington 9:55pm or close to that time. Flight attendants reassured everyone that their connecting flights were still on time we would be fine. When I got to the gate for my connecting flight it was closed. No other flights are leaving out tonight. So I have to sleep in the airport. Catch a morning flight to Atl. The purpose of the email is communications should have been had between 6319 plane and 6322 plane. 6322 never knew of our delays so they proceeded to leave on schedule. I feel like just changing my flight and me sit and sleep over night in an airport is very insensitive. Poor customer service. I fly often and will never fly with United again. I was on a flight once yrs ago and there were a group of people on an international flight. That airline waited for their flight to land because they understood that the plane delays should not effect the passengers. I fault the staff and pilot for lack of communication. Hopefully this will bring about some change.;NEGATIVE

Right after takeoff most of the team disappear, during the long flight (15hr) I couldn't see air crew activity if you needed anything, the one at the galley was eating or reading emails. They forgot to give the amenity kit to 90% of the business class passengers, the plastic bags of blankets and water bottles left on my seat (at the seat upper storage area) were all over the flight and overall the Polaris that should be Business First is cozy and small for passenger above 185 cm with 2x2x2 configuration (meaning the window seat need to jump over you). Overall not a legacy airline at all, long way to go.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-02-03;" | Flew San Francisco to Auckland with United Airlines. Check-in staff were unenthusiastic. Service at the United lounge was terrible. The male attendant at the reception desk had a bad attitude. Some of the flight attendants were lukewarm. Overall the attendants' service was nowhere near the Asian airlines, such as Singapore. Polaris business class is decent but still falls short of Singapore's quality. Onboard Wi-Fi was slow even when loading webpages, and they explicitly said streaming videos wasn't allowed. On airlines like China Eastern I could stream videos smoothly. Airlines like Singapore pay attention to every detail, such as the check-in staff. United falls short every here and there. After the mergers, United has monopolized tons of routes, so now they make money off of the monopoly and don't care about service quality whatsoever. Will not fly them other than on exclusive routes.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-02-02;" | Grand Rapids to Newark. I had a bad feeling when I booked with United but as this was for a job interview and I was asked to fly out in three days, I didn't have any other choice but to take whatever flights were available - my original sense of dread turned out to be justified and I certainly will not be flying with United again. The flight was scheduled to take off at 7:30 PM, it's 9:38 PM and I'm still here. Initially, they announced a 3 hour delay, then, figuring that wasn't inconvenient enough, they changed it to 4 hours. So instead of arriving at my destination at 9:30 PM as I was originally scheduled to do so, I will be getting in at 1:40 AM - no big deal. And of course the United employees at the kiosk make it quite clear through their laissez faire attitude, and at times downright rude behavior, that they really don't care about the fact that paying customers are waiting out a 4 hour delay. It's very obvious United doesn't give any thought to customer service. When asked what the issue is, they respond with ""Oh, the plane is undergoing maintenance."" Funny, I figured maintenance would be done routinely, not when it has the potential to ruin as many lives as possible. And, shouldn't there maybe be a backup plan? Is every single United plane currently being used with no consideration given to the possibility of unforeseen mishaps like this? I especially like the response I received from the snooty United employee when I asked if there were any other flights available - ""No, probably not..."" Probably not? Umm, do you mind checking perhaps? Which she begrudgingly did after I asked. Real problem solvers they got there. I'm also really glad I signed up for both their email and text message alerts regarding flight changes. I received neither. I'm sure they just didn't want to fill up my inbox or use up my monthly text message allowance. I suppose United figured this was the best way to earn back some respect. Nice job guys, this will certainly be my last flight with this airline. United has steadily been losing credibility amongst my circle of professional colleagues, and it's not difficult to see why.";NEGATIVE

Check-in at TPA was immediate and simple, but Denver was another story. The Premier Access line was only 3 or 4 minutes long, but had I been a normal economy passenger, the line stretched interminably. Boarding for all three flights was disciplined and orderly. all flights pushed back early, departed promptly, and arrived ahead of schedule. On the TPA-DEN and DEN-IAD flights I had the forward, over-wing exit row window, with the middle seat unoccupied. On the IAD-TPA segment, the whole exit row was open, but I was upgraded to an aisle seat in first class. This experience confirmed for me that the exit row seats are the best in the plane and beat 1st class on narrow-body aircraft, particularly if one or both adjacent seats are unoccupied. On the DEN-IAD flight, I purchased the southwestern omelet for breakfast, and I was very pleased with the taste and the presentation. The crew on all flights were pleasant and efficient, my luggage arrived promptly, and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2018-01-28;" | Flew United Airlines from San Jose California to Houston Texas. I bought a ticket for my aunt who has Alzheimer's and bought her premium economy so she has more leg room and made sure she had an aisle seat to grab an attendant if she needed help. They moved her seat four times! Each time I had to call and say, she can not be put in economy, that is not what I paid for, and she can not be in a window seat! She has to be able to flag an attendant if she needs something! They tried putting her in a window seat, economy instead of premium economy, etc.. Dealing with a person that has Alzheimer's is bad enough, dealing with a horrible airline that I had to call several times to argue about why they cant move her seat is just horrible. They have notes in their system that she has this medical issue and I think they are trying to take advantage of that! ";NEGATIVE

Even though there was an issue with the WiFi they made sure everyone was able to log on quickly and gave iPads for those who couldn’t log on. Also we ended up confusing our flight that was on Alaska and a similar flight and time was at United. When we realized this at the United help desk it was too late to get to our Alaska flight within seconds they put us on their flight and offered to move our bags to that flight as well.  Also those German waffle cookie things are heaven.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2018-01-25;" |  Boston to Hong Kong via Newark. My flight BOS-EWR was delayed due to late arrival of the aircraft and I had a short connection in EWR to continue towards HKG. The customer service is unhelpful, as if the delay is your fault, not theirs. They refused to board me on an earlier flight, they could not offer re-routing nor sponsor the ticket with another airline to secure my journey. The delay was ultimately tight for my connection, but every UA representative I spoke to suggested the other flight would have likely waited. It did not. It left six minutes earlier than scheduled. Despite asking to the flight attendants while on flight whether my connection would have waited, the response was that United - differently from every other Star Alliance company - does not offer this ""service"". I landed and there was no representative to direct delayed passengers. I rushed to the gate to make the unpleasant discovery that my connection departed earlier. I thus went for the customer service. I stood on a line for 3h and 15m. Around 45 minutes after landing, a text message invited me to check-in for my next flight, from which I derived I was booked for the same flight the following day. After hours of waiting, I reached a representative that handed me a voucher for the hotel and US$ 30 for three meals: yes, $ 10 per meal. Not to mention, the hotel was sketchy and sub-standard. The flights were possibly the worst I have ever experienced in 14 years of flying. In over 16h flight (plus boarding, taxing, etc.) they serve two microscopic meals and one snack. No snacks in the galley. Never seen such misery. The crew was confrontational at all stages. They said: ""We are nice to people who are nice to us"", which is reasonable in abstract, but they seem to forget we are not fellow travellers! I am the customer, they are the flight attendants. As I have reached my final destination over 25h later than initially scheduled, I sought compensation from United. Unsurprisingly, their customer service is dismissive. I was told I can buy insurance next time. I do have insurance, but they cover unforeseeable events, not negligence of the carrier. I have been trying to hold them liable under the Montreal Convention, but so far all they offer are pointless vouchers in the illusion that I would ever subject myself again to the pain of dealing with such an unpleasant, unprofessional, unapologetic company. United airlines punishes you for making the unwise choice of traveling with them. Despite you pay for a service, they drop on you the cost of their inefficiency. Leaving aside old aircrafts, primitive forms of IFE that have disappeared in the rest of the world, broken controls, dirty and hard seats, meals that not even if you live out stamps. The point is the lack of consideration, the way they treat a paying customer at every stage of the experience, from check in to customer service when you try to claim damages for the disservice they caused you. Finally, UA cheats selling tickets with connecting time they cannot really respect or guarantee. They are cheating to rank higher on search engines with prices and journey duration. On any international flight, make sure you have 2.5h connecting time minimum. Few reviews will tell you UA is less worse than they say: don't gamble with it. Choose better.";NEGATIVE

They had an issue getting us checked in and because of that, we didn't get checked in before the 30 minute requirement on international flight so they wouldn't let us on our flight. Then on the way back, our flight was cancelled. Their customer service representatives do not care and are rude. Their flight attendants are rude. They do not care that your flight was cancelled and you need to get home because you have kids, work etc. They didn't even want to give us a food or beverage voucher. I will never use United again.

I asked for a wheelchair because of a knee problem and they took forever to get somebody, I had to ask 4 times. They were rude again and told me I could start walking or wait until they had time to call the wheelchair person. If I paid for a service they should provide the service, not have a bad attitude with their clients. Not helpful at all. I wont fly with United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-01-23;" |  Raleigh Durham to Chicago. United Economy Plus has a significant advantage in its legroom comparing to regular United Economy seats. A dedicated overhead compartment was provided for Economy Plus passengers, meaning I did not have to fight over someone for a space in order to accommodate my carry-on baggage. The seats were narrow, and were poorly padded. Only non-alcoholic drinks were provided free of charge, when alcoholic drinks and snacks were available for purchase. I have attempted to use the inflight entertainment, which did not work since it could not read any credit card in my wallet. I bought the inflight Wi-Fi. It did work and managed to provide a decent speed (fast enough for internet browsing and photo sharing apps). The cabin crew on my flight were nice, friendly and helpful. Overall, United Economy is a acceptable product for flights that are 4 hours or under. However if I am flying intercontinental, I would consider flying another carrier, since the same seat product is applied to all planes in UA's fleet.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2018-01-23;" | A complete disaster. First leg (Toronto to O'Hare) on Saturday had a lavatory problem - so we pushed back (got that on time departure) only to sit for a while and then return to the gate. But since it was an int'l flight we were not allowed off the plane and the CSR refused to get on the plane. Eventually left 99 minutes late even though FAA's MFR rules do not require a working lav. On return flight first leg (Omaha to Chicago) Sunday we arrived early but there our gate was occupied so we sat for an hour, even though you could see multiple empty gates at terminal. Connection flight was very tight and when we ran to the new gate we found it had left 10 minutes early. So much for that thing known as customer service. I am a frequent flyer (about 100 legs a year) and a Star Alliance Gold Member, but this is the last straw (United has messed me over before).

Not only did they not help with the seating they were passing rude comments throughout ""Ma'am you're making this more complicated than it already is."" ""Didn't you hear, I just made the announcement"". I heard ""no"" at least 10 times in 10 minutes.

united-airlines;2018-01-18;" | Absolute worst airline I've ever flown with. I had a bad experience with them in the past, but this was the only flight returning to Seattle from Fresno that I could find. Both flights (my flight to SFO, and the connecting flight from SFO to SEA) were delayed at least an hour, if not more. In SFO we were supposed to leave at 8.40pm, but were delayed. However, we still boarded even more passengers, and were told we would be taking off at 9.10pm. But, because we continued boarding we didn't leave the ground until after 9.30pm. No explanation was made by the captain or the flight crew, but there we sat, waiting and waiting and waiting. The flight was hot and stuffy. I also was incredibly annoyed with the baggage policy. When I booked my flight, there was no communication that I couldn't bring a carry on bag. As this was a very short trip, I brought just a carry on and my personal item. But when I checked in, I was informed I couldn't have one and needed to have it checked, for an additional $25, and that I couldn't even check it at the gate. I've never in my life, been told this before. I literally had to rethink everything I packed and how I packed it, as I had a layover and needed to do homework. When I got to the United booth at FAT to drop off my now checked bag, there was no one there, and the other customer and I waited ten minutes for them to return, again with no explanations. The kicker was when I got to the gate and everyone who had a carry-on bags was given a tag (no additional charge) for their tagged bag! Coupled with so many other things that went wrong today, having a horrible flight experience was the worst thing that could have happened. So take heed, if you fly Basic Economy, you have to a) pay a $25 checked bag for an otherwise acceptable carry-on bag on any other airline, and b) if you fail to check the bag there is an additional $25 fee on top of the checked bag fee if you check it at the gate. Absolute swindle. You buy a cheap flight because you can afford it, but then you have to pay extra for something every other basic airline ticket allows you to have. If I can possibly avoid it, I will never fly with them again.";NEGATIVE

Food in general is awful but when they came to my seat, the option would have been chicken or beef. The attendant said to me your option is only beef or beef. I looked at him like, what? He laughed and said sorry and my response was I'm sorry but I do not eat beef. His response was literally ""you can eat the stuff around the beef"". Mind you, I had seen a flight attendant come up and grab five chicken entrees before the serving was finished. I asked him if there was anyway to get chicken as I honestly don't eat beef nevermind eating around what the plate had. It had nothing except powdered mashed potatoes. This was a ten hour flight, I wasn't going to starve because of the lack of organization. In the end a flight attendant overheard how upset I was and they gave one of the ones they had taken. I know it is not the flight attendants fault at all but at least be respectful of others dietary needs. Our flight cost enough even on economy to provide us with better food services.";NEGATIVE

Once on the plane for the 11hr flight home the flight attendants were very rude. At one point we were snapped at because we hadn’t filled out the entry to the US card on time.

The other flight was behind and we didn’t have a place to port. So we missed our connecting flight. We had to check bags in valet so we had to wait for that but they lost our bag. I But the lady was super rude and told us it wasn’t their fault and was convinced we never valet our bag. Even though I had the receipt and the claim voucher. When we asked the lady at the counter to call down and ask them to hold the connecting door for seriously only 3 or 4 minutes, she said no - we sprinted down there to find out that they closed the door early. We go to counter to get new flights, they were rude, and wouldn’t comp any meals or hotel or anything. They booked us on a United flight that left 14 hours later. We went down to check in with United since we had a million hours to kill. United Airlines not only gave us food vouchers, they put us up on cots and gave us toiletries for free. They upgraded our seats, then had a person personally escort us to the United club so we could sleep for the night. They then tracked down our missing bag and paid to have it delivered to our house the same day we arrived home. Plus their WiFi worked in board. And they have really good cookies too. Basically United went above and beyond to accommodate when it wasn’t even their fault. We were super super pleased by them and all their staff! Congrats United.

Overall a good experience with excellent staff in Denver who helped me change my ticket due to urgent change in plans. Lounges could be a bit better in terms of food. On board all the crews were friendly and smiling and seemed to want to help passengers. Both flights totally full but boarded on time with early arrivals on both sides despite bad weather all over USA. I think the first class food experience could be a bit better but its fair in coach where you can buy what you want. Crews seemed patient dealing with a few difficult passengers. Wi-fi worked great in both directions.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2018-01-13; |  Indianapolis to Chicago O’Hare. The worst airline I’ve ever had to deal with. We knew we were getting sleet and ice since 3am. Waited on the runway for 2 hours to finally take off to Chicago and missed our flight from Chicago to Mexico. They state they will not pay for our stay since we leave tomorrow morning. Weather is out of your control. But being prepared for that weather is not. Will never fly with United after this trip.;NEGATIVE

I called to have my return flight changed from 12-30 to 12-27 for a family emergency. The agent charged me $200. On 12/27, I went to check-in, realized my return flight hadn't been changed, and I called them. After sitting on hold for an hour and a half, the agent was extremely rude and told me she couldn't change my flight to that same day because the fare difference was too large. Since then I have sat on hold for a total of five hours, talked to several different agents who claimed they recorded the information and sent it along to the complaint department. I finally found out nothing had been recorded, so I submitted a complaint online. When someone finally reached me, she offered a $100 voucher. My original ticket was worth $400, they completely messed that up, were rude about it, and I sat on hold for hours to resolve the issue because of their lack of communication between departments. Now I'm left with half a ticket, leaving me no choice but to fly with these people again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2018-01-12;" |  Chicago to Columbia. Delay after delay after delay. We heard of inclement weather happening on our return trip so we called the airline and paid to have our tickets changed to an earlier flight. Now, we are stuck at our connection and will be arriving home close to the same time we were originally scheduled after the inclement weather has already hit. A waste of time, a waste of money. We literally could have spent an entire day working in D.C. but because of the ineptitude of this airline we lost a full day. This happened on our flight out as well, delayed in Denver. It seems that United cannot be held accountable to their own schedule.";NEGATIVE

Due to the holiday season, the tickets were expensive so this was my only option. My first flight from DC to SF as delayed, and I had a connecting flight so I almost missed it, we stayed on the plane for 3 hours before takeoff. Whenever I asked the flight attendants about it, they were so rude and defensive and seemed unwilling to help me. The plane was so old and dirty and no leg room. The international flight from SF to HK was also delayed though not the airline's fault. I think the service and flight attendants on international flights are way better than the domestic ones. They had a good selection of movies, though the food was just average. Overall for the price I paid I say it wasn't worth it, and I wouldn't want to fly with United again.";NEGATIVE

Customer Service had an attitude when trying to get the next flight to where I was going and they made me sit at Houston airport for 8 hours. Finally get to my plane after sitting in Houston for that long and I am standing in line and they had to apparently “drain the lavatory” which then delayed that flight another 30 minutes. Over priced for the kind of service you receive. It is no wonder why Southwest does as well as it does. Avoid this airline at all costs.;NEGATIVE

First off, the flight was delayed and I decided to get a snack from a vending machine. It got stuck. One of the pilots and a stewardess helped me get it out without me even asking. I hadn't noticed they were also waiting for the delayed flight. They helped us with our puppy getting used to the plane, and when I got sick, they came quickly with a sick-bag and a cup of ginger-ale. So, they showed me very good service, were very friendly, and went the extra mile. ";POSITIVE

Firstly for a flight of 7-8 hrs the Boeing 757 is a small plane with little or no leg space and cramped up passengers cos seats are 3-3. Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight. Furthermore, there was no apology from crew until the flight landed in Heathrow where the crew finally apologised and said passengers to go online and get an appreciation voucher from United. This when I did that it gave me a USD100 discount code on any United Airlines with many conditions attached to it, unfortunately I won’t be flying United again at any cost, therefore even this voucher is of no use. On positive side I landed safely and food and drinks was ok for an international flight.";NEGATIVE

The trip there wasn't too bad other than the fact that they had t.v,s on the seat in front of you with direct t.v. and a remote control on the armrest. The problem was most of the remotes didn't work, and you couldn't change the channel. It was ridiculous. We didn't mind too much though, because we were more excited for our trip than concerned with our 4 hour flight stuck on one channel we didn't choose. The real problem came during our trip. We were supposed to fly back from LAX at 10 pm on December 31, 2017. We got an email late at night on the 29th, we didn't even see it until the morning of the 30th, saying our flight was changed. Just like that they changed our flight to 12:50am on the 30th. We lost basically a whole day that we had already planned out with relatives with basically no notice because they overbooked the flight. But we went anyway. At the airport almost 30 people were on standby for our flight. Then we were delayed over an hour. Then we flew to Houston, TX for a two hour layover. Then back on a plane to Tulsa. It made for a very long, very angry night. I'd pay an extra $150 a ticket or more before I'd ever fly United again. They do not care about their customers or our plans. This was a terrible experience.";NEGATIVE

I looked at a departures board and noticed another United flight left in just an hour. Went to the United customer service desk to see if I could switch. The woman at the counter didn't have the decency to great me with a hello and before I even finished asking my question she told me there was nothing I could change at all. Her response was simply ""no changes"". I went to the gate and asked if there were seats available, the gate attended said ""possibly"" then looked at my ticket and informed the contract I signed when booking basic economy forbid me from changing flights. I asked ""even if there are empty seats on an earlier flight?"" And she said ""no changes can be made with this ticket if it were economy I might be able to do something"". I'm happy the gate employee at least explained my situation but this is ridiculous. United wanted to charge me another $35 for this trip to be economy. I paid $75 so that's nearly a increase. I understand I bought a cheap ticket, that's why I wasn't even allowed a carry on bag. However, when there's something as simple as putting a passenger, with no carry on or checked luggage, on the same size aircraft going to the same destination and United won't do it. That's ridiculous. It wouldn't cost them a dime more but I wasn't at the right paygrade for the company to care. Basically what I heard from United today was ""give me money and I'll give a sh*t about you"". Needless to say, they won't be getting my business in the future.";NEGATIVE

My flight was cancelled due to inclement weather, and there was barely any flexibility in my flight change (had to be moved to the next day, but very limited in support), zero flexibility in allowing a carry on even though more time had been accrued, and very little acknowledgment of the difficulty that arises with a flight cancellation.

Last time I flew United I actually rented a car at midnight in Denver and drove 8 hours home rather than get stranded in Denver for 1.5 days with no hotel or any compensation. When I was flying from Pierre SD to Billings years ago they would often cancel flights for ""mechanical reasons"" and make you stay another day so they could fill planes.

We found both legs of our flight on an A319 from Albany to Chicago and our 777-200 flight from Chicago to San Francisco to be outstanding. Check in and boarding was painless. Drinks were served within a minute of us taking our seats while the crew was friendly, professional and positive. Albany to Chicago was a quick flight with the seats great, inflight entertainment working well etc. The second leg on the 777-200 was everything and then some. Yes we had to sit to wait to be de-iced for almost 45 minutes, no problem,. Crew was equally as friendly on our second leg, flight 470 from Chicago to San Francisco. Every 10-15 minutes they were around to offer drinks, blankets or see if we needed anything. Some complain about the new Polaris seating, not sure why, we found them to have plenty of room, while lying flat or in any position. The breakfast was really great with a protein or spinach egg white option, both served with fresh fruit, soft biscuit and Greek yogurt. Really have to say United did a very nice job today! Only reason I didn’t give 5 stats for inflight entertainment was no live tv without paying, still plenty of movie options though. Luggage came out fast, all in all a great experience!";POSITIVE

It started off as follows: we booked a flight from Montreal to San Francisco with a connecting flight in Newark. Upon arriving in San Francisco, we noticed that both mine and my husband’s luggage were nowhere to be found. They said that his was still in Newark and mine apparently was in San Francisco (at the airport). They couldn’t locate my bag for 3 full days. We had to spend out of pocket for all kinds of clothes and toiletries (putting a major damper on our time in San Fran). They only delivered my husbands luggage two days later. To make matters worse, when locating where my luggage was, I told them that I would pick it up at the airport later in the day, as we had a wine tour in Napa scheduled. We passed by the airport later in the evening only to be told that my luggage was now on a flight to LA. Myself nor my husband ever told them to go ahead and do that! Their level of efficiency and service is extremely poor and I wouldn’t ever recommend them to anyone. Unless you want serious unnecessary problems due to stupidity and lack of care, avoid this airline!";NEGATIVE

The attendant come to us and made her to move back to her seat saying that was not allowed to do that. What?

Not only did we have a nightmare experience on the out flight from MYR to Newark, the return flight experience was a nightmare as well. Resulting in my 2 children, who are flying together (17 years and 13 years old) to miss their flight. United Airlines allowed 2 minors to miss a flight. Even tho they were there when they needed to be. The check in process took so long, along with the security check thru process, that caused a major delay in there progress. Not only did they miss there flight, but now they have to wait until the following day, to experience this terror again. How is it that a major commercial airline, only has 1 flight a day. How is it that a multi billion dollar company, cannot take action, to get 2 minor children in a different flight. Instead, they make them travel back, a 2 hour travel, to do it again. First off, the ""Unaccompanied Minor"" charge is fraud. When booking these tickets, the website said nothing about added fees. The tickets were bought and paid for, and while attempting to do the check in process, United Airlines slams people with added fees. On the day of a flight. That is not ok. I get a voucher for our initial troubles (which We were under the assumption that could be used for the return flight fees) and got denied that as well. A $150 ticket, turned well over 400 dollars by the time this was said and done. Only for my children to miss a return flight, due to the faulty set up of United Airlines .";NEGATIVE

We updated our connecting flight due to the delay and were supposed to have an hour in ORD before boarding our plane to DEN. However, our United flight spent half an hour searching for a gate causing us to almost miss our connecting flight. Additionally, our checked bag was lost and had to be delivered. It was also not delivered at the time it was promised. On our flight back, we got out of DEN fine, but arrived at ORD at 12 and with our connecting flight leaving at 3.45. Due to United's incompetence, we were stuck in the airport on NYE until 6.10 and did not make it home until hours after we were supposed to.

After a rubbish experience in MCO, I gave the UA Club lounge another try, as IAD is UA’s hub, but the same disappointing experience, although the lounge was more modern and had a nicer design than the one in MCO. However, food items offered again very poor, just soup, salads, some poor looking highly processed cheese cubes and crackers and some veggies with dip. self service beverages items limited to water, coffee and tea. others were served at a manned bar and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks, even for domestic beers. No cash is accepted, except of course for tips which are expected. The flight to LAX was initially announced as being on time, but 10 minutes after boarding should have commenced, a delay of boarding has been announced due to a maintenance issue (change of tire), but still no official delay has been announced. This is especially irritating as UA’s boarding procedure requires all passengers (including children, First Class and Priority) to line up in 5 different queues according to boarding groups like applicants for a free handout before boarding starts. So, instead of waiting seated for boarding to begin, people were standing in line or sitting on the floor for the boarding to begin. Also, the flight turned out to be overbooked. Boarding than started with a delay of twenty minutes. Departure was finally delayed 60 minutes, as in addition to maintenance issue, we had to wait for the baggage to be loaded. Pretty incompetent procedure. On board, classic first class domestic recliner seats in a 2x2 set up. Seats were big but surprisingly hard, so again not that comfortable. The plane had direct tv on a mini screen, but no headphones provided, so useless. Dinner was “chicken”, “salmon” or “vegetarian pasta”, no further information given, no menus provided. Starter was a rocket salad and dessert a sundae. Found the food uninspired and barely edible. Lights were off during the whole (early evening) flight - even during meal service - FA's best part of flight, however FA’s were professional. 30 minutes arrival delay into LAX. The wait for the arrival of the luggage was ok, but priority luggage came out whenever. Finally, UA also managed to mistreat my luggage (broken handle). Was told by UA, that this is not their problem or responsibility. No refinement in UA's service and the word ""please"" is clearly not part of UA vocabulary, as I did not hear it to be used once by any of their employees in the air or on the ground.

Check in - even for F - was through automated kiosks only. Short line, but taking longer than necessary through to the need to go through many screens focusing on upselling (e.g. to buy UA miles, even if one is not member of the UA frequent flyer program- thoughtless, unnecessary and irritating). UA did not provide TSA priority access at MCO for First Class passengers, but the overall wait was tolerable, as the line was moving fast in spite of many, many people standing in line. Visited UA Club Lounge, which was very basic and food items offered during lunch time poor especially when compared to lounges operated by non U.S. airlines, soup, salads, some poor looking highly processed cheese cubes and crackers and some veggies with dip. self service beverages items limited to water, coffee and tea. others were served at a manned bar and there is a charge for alcoholic drinks, even for domestic beers. No cash is accepted, except of course for tips which are expected. Rubbish and useless lounge. Also, was only allowed into the lounge as I had Star Gold status with an other airline. A First Class ticket alone will not give you access. On board 2-1-2 seat layout, which looked like an international business cabin. Seats were lie-flat, but I was not able to find a comfortable lounging position and fully flat the seats looked claustrophobic. Not an issue for a two hour flight, but would have been very frustrated to end up in these seats on a transatlantic flight. Pre-flight drinks were served. Otherwise, just beverage service on this 2 hour lunch time flight, cabin service professional with FA’s present in the cabin and trying to give good service with the limited options UA gave them, so flight experience was ok, without being great and nowhere close to a first or business class experience. On a positive note, there was IFE available (AVOD with good screens and nice selection of movies), which could be used before takeoff till touchdown.

There were many economy plus seats available and I suggested that I pay the extra fee for one of those seats. I was told that as an economy client, I didn't qualify for the seat. I spoke to five different agents including a supervisor and always offered to pay the uncharge. I was refused. That night, I upgraded my current seat to economy plus. The next day, I asked another agent and she gave me seats on the flight with my family! Was she nice or did my upgrade then make me suitable for a placement on the flight.

You really were in constant shoulder touch with one of your fellow passengers! Leg space is barely sufficient. The back of the seat did not recline noticeably. Thanks to being in the aisle seat, I could stretch out my right leg at times. Boarding at both airports were smoothly organized by boarding groups and overhead luggage space was ample. Individual flight entertainment systems were easy to use and they had a good collection of Hollywood, Bollywood, Asian and European movies. Beer and wine were complimentary. Two meals were served, portions were small. Lot of special meals -- kosher, Asian vegetarian, etc -- were delivered by frazzled flight attendants running up and down to match meals with passengers. The plan announcements in English and Hebrew were overly loud and frequent. The toilets were reasonably clean given the nearly 11 hours flight. There were snacks in the galley to pick on. Small bottles of water were available aplenty. All-in-all, a well-managed, though crowded flight.";POSITIVE

But once they were gone it went smoothly. Heathrow security was, unusually, working quickly and the staff were even smiling. Unfortunately there was a 15 minute walk to the gate. Boarding was a little confused having been selected for an extra TSA check. This meant that I circumnavigated the ticket process. They then asked why I was on the aircraft. It also seemed slightly pointless because they swabbed one of my laptops without noticing that I was carrying two. I’m totally in favour of tight security but this exercise seemed counterproductive. Boarding was otherwise very efficient. It was a new aircraft – very clean and everything was working. A good selection of movies and an easy-to-understand IFE. I like the Boeing 787. The lighting is perfect, air conditioning pleasant and ample overhead locker space. I usually travel business and was not looking forward to travelling at the very back of the aircraft but I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were excellent – friendly, funny and assiduous in their duties. There was no problem with asking for more wine and the food was delicious. Another pleasant surprise was the lack of annoying announcements – a lesson some Middle East airlines could learn. The flight left on time and arrived early. Given how cheap the ticket was, it is difficult to find anything at fault with this flight. United should be proud of its cabin crew who excelled themselves.";POSITIVE

So we showed up to the airport at 6:00am to find our original flight didn’t exist and we were too late to board the new flight. The reason the flight didn’t exist is because United stopped service with our connecting city of Houston for a few months, so we were re routed through Chicago. We then had to come back for a 4:00pm flight instead of the intended 7:00am flight. This we had to pay for an extra Uber trip to and from the airport, we missed our car rental and wasted hours of our day. The entire situation would have been avoided if United had simply informed us that the flight had been changed and made sure we knew! It is now a few days before our return flight and I called United customer service and they have no idea about the re-routing and flight changes. So I am unable I find out the information on our flight going back to Charleston. I am blown away that United is this incredibly disorganized. Not only did they change our flight and not tell us, but their systems don’t even show when they no longer offer flights between two cities and their customer service had no idea that we were previously re-routed for that reason.

When I asked the lady why our seats had be switched she replied in the rudest tone possible told me ""if I would have just read the fine print we wouldn't be having this conversation"" - if it wasn't an airport I would have not just taken my seat. Absolutely rude and uncalled for, did not want to explain what was going on. It is what it is though I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone and will pay the extra $50 to fly Alaska from now on!";NEGATIVE

Food was horrible. Rice and chicken were dry with low quality sauce. Mango sorbet tasted horrible. IFE on my seat didn't work properly while service was okay. Lots of friendly chat with fellow attendants while not so friendly with passengers its more like let me do my job and thats it. Cabin looked tired. Not much left to be desired, just the same horrible experience I had 6 years ago on a memorable 16 hours mind exhausting flight. ";NEGATIVE

The night I got back, I woke up at 3am in a panic, realizing what I had done and filled out their lost baggage online form. To my surprise, I got a text back from United no less than 5 minutes later (at 3am – great service!) that said they had found it and gave me the option to pick it up or have it shipped to me. I chose to pick it up that morning from SFO and the woman working at the service desk in United's baggage claim terminal was extremely helpful – I had my laptop back in about 2 minutes! After doing what I never thought I would – leaving my laptop on the plane United provided me with excellent service on Christmas Eve and returned it back to me. Thank you United and thanks to their lost and found department!";POSITIVE

I was told by reservations the laptop would not be a 3rd item. When I arrived to board the plane I was told I could not board with 3 bags. The laptop was a 3rd bag. Really? They finally allowed me to board. Inbound to Austin via Houston I thought I would need to check 3 bags. $25 for first, $35 for 2nd and $150 for third. Seriously? I was able to combine. Thank Goodness. Flight from Baton Rouge was delayed. The airline did not notify my connecting United flight so they could wait. Houston is a large airport. No courtesy. I will never fly United again.";NEGATIVE

We have been delayed several times with United- once for seven hours due to no plane, then no crew, then other issues- we had about 10 updates to our departure time, so terrible estimates. Major issues like not having a plane? Isn’t this an airline company? Isn’t that your entire business? A two hour delay seems pretty standard. Yes the flights are cheaper, but if you need or want to depart on time don’t bother with United. Also, twice now the departure time has changed after booking before check in. We are seriously considering another airline since we’re tired of spending hours at the airport.";NEGATIVE

We were lied to over three times when we landed in Houston. The flight attendant told us we would make our connection so we ran there to find out the gate was closed before we even got off our first flight. Each person we talked to was very rude and blamed everything on the weather, holidays or us the consumer. I have never had a worst experience with customer service. This whole thing is horrible. The lady that gave us our flights for the next day gave us a discount for a hotel. Needless to say I didn’t put a hotel stay in Houston in my budget. I will never fly United ever again and the only way they can make up for giving me the worst start to my vacation is a full refund.

You can see a big difference between flying an airline like Emirates and then flying United. Their customer service is very poor. One male flight attendant from SFO-SYD clearly didn't like his job at all. I asked for water because I wasn't feeling well and he made no attempt to get it, he had a sour look on his face the whole flight and he would just look at you instead of asking ""what drink would you like"" etc. Everything seemed like a hassle to him and every interaction with him was awkward. The airline is acceptable but if you have the money, fly any other airline with a better reputation).";NEGATIVE

When we wen to customer service for accomodations, they booked us (my daughter and I) on a flight that didn’t even take us to Miami, it took us to Ft Lauderdale instead and they sat my daughter ten seats away from me. My bags were delivered to Miami on the wrong flight. I am writing this review from Newark to Ft Lauderdale. My plane leaves at 10:06. I am hoping I can have my bag delivered when I get to Fort Lauderdale. My bags are some where now in Miami International Airport. United Airlines had poor logistics coordination. Customer service agents are not caring, and they remove themselves from the responsibility of answering a simple question. I purchased a connecting flight and because of their negligence I ended up paying for a hotel in New Jersey with no coats to protect ourselves from the cold. Me and my daughter stranded by this airline and they didn’t do anything to help us for this inconvenience. I know, I am never flying United again. This is the only way I express my frustration.";NEGATIVE

I continued to achieve Platinum Elite status in all these recent years despite the problems United has continued to have. I lived through disastrous operations during the merger, including having a phone agent cancel my flight on me while I was on the way to the airport to get on that flight. In all these bad years, for the most part, you could get a sense that the customer service agents had directions to try to find some way to resolve significant complaints. A few frequent flier miles here, a small value travel voucher there. They have clearly abandoned doing that. In the major operations mistakes they made with me over the past year and a half, their approach, as on my most recent bad experience, is to offer no solution. They now just have a cookie cutter, fill in the blanks 'we're sorry and we appreciate your business' reply. What I have now resolved is that I am done with United. They no longer work to earn my business, so I will now endeavor to fly with anyone except United.";NEGATIVE

First, they make us pay to check our luggage, so if you think you're getting a good deal on your flight, think again. Then, the gate number changed 3 times during our layover in Houston with only 1 hour to spare and the gates were on exact opposite ends of the airport. My husband recently had bilateral hip replacement and was not able to sprint to either end of the airport in a timely fashion, so we consequently missed our flight. The woman at the check in was rude and told us we weren't paying attention, when in fact we were trying to run from the other end of the airport to make it in time. Then we went to customer service to attempt to reach some sort of resolution, and were met with hostility and deflection. We are now stuck at this airport until tomorrow afternoon. A 20 hr layover because they refuse to take responsibility for their incompetence. ";NEGATIVE

I was waiting in line for a kiosk with my friend on our flight back from Denver. Her kiosk went through and was able to check a bag, however, mine did not. We checked in at the same exact time as shown on my ticket printed from the kiosk showing me to go see additional services. They had me wait in line for 20 plus minutes after they knew I was already running late. As soon as I got up to the lady she tells me it is too late and I cannot get on the flight. I asked there has to be an alternative, and explained my roommate who I came with and was my ride also we showed up together at the same time and she was able to check her bags. I spoke with a supervisor as she told me the same thing, there is nothing they can do but put me on a 6pm flight (mind you it was 9am at this time) and I was originally on the 6pm flight and they moved me to the 9am flight because of weather delays in Philadelphia. This being said they did nothing to help try to accommodate me and did not show one bit of guilt or sorrow in any way. I went ahead and bought an American Airlines ticket and they were amazing. Do not fly with United! ";NEGATIVE

I carried my suitcase for a reason, I didnt want to check it in. Already annoyed, I boarded the plane to find out that there were multiple issues with the plane causing us to wait onboard. After several hours they told us we could deplane, use the restrooms and grab a quick bite. Being one of the first off the plane, the lady at the door said with an attitude that if we weren't back when they close the doors then we were out of luck. I asked her if there was going to be an announcement. She said we will announce it at the door but not over the loud speaker. How can you say that to people that are deplaning? It's their duty to announce the closing of the gate so everyone that left can hear. Long story short, there was a 6 hour delay and we had to board a new plane. We were given $10 voucher for food but that couldnt even buy me a sandwich. I lost all of my daylight time at my destination. Annoyed about having to wait at baggage claim, once I recieved my carry-on I noticed all of the zippers were opened. This is not my idea of a vacation. ";NEGATIVE

Poor elderly folks trying to catch their connecting flights were trying to figure out what they should do and the advise is this, ""if it were me, I would get off the plane and find another day to fly"" or it was a short and impatient tone. The same crew responded to me in the same way when I asked if they could let the gate of the connecting flight know that I would be running almost a half a mile accross the airport to reach my connection. After running accross the airport and reaching my connecting gate, the guy manning the stand said I'm sorry they pulled the bridge back already, the plane had not even left yet. This was the last flight out for the night which led to me missing an event. The next day, the app made me walk a mile out of the way to the wrong terminal. I finally got on the plane and guess what, the plane happens to be the smallest plane available. To give you perspective, I am 6'7m, the height of the roof of the plane was about 5'8. To top it all off, my flight was 30 min delayed on my final departure. I will never again fly with United Airlines.";NEGATIVE

Upon receiving multiple emails reminding me that it was time to check in for my flight, I went to the website to check in only to be told that I could not. After multiple attempts on multiple devices, I finally received an email telling me to call United in order to check in. The associates informed me that I could not check in due to the fact that I had booked an economy ticket and did not have a checked bag. If I purchased a checked bag, I would be able to check in online. Please note that this policy change is new and it is buried in the fine print way down a page that can be accessed through a prompt that is in fine print, in a nearly transparent color. There is a red box on the page where you confirm your ticket that offers trip advisory/restrictions on the flight and it can be seen clear as day and this policy is not addressed there. You have to dig for it. I needed the mobile pass due to scheduling and not being able to get to the airport in enough time to wait in line to check in and then again to get through security and after speaking to 3 people, I was informed that there was nothing that any of them could do. So now, 18 hours before I even get to the airport, United has already wasted my time, messed up my schedule, misled me and tried to extort me into purchasing the checked bag (which I don't need), just so I can get the mobile boarding pass and adhere to my schedule. Don't let it happen to you. Such a scam.";NEGATIVE

Being aboard the American Airlines flight was actually such a luxury, the seats reclined and the TV's actually worked. Unfortunately we had to fly United back from Auckland to Boston. The seats were cramped, hardly reclined. Then flying back from SFO to Boston, the flight attendants were rude and we actually didn't even get pretzels.

When we arrived at the gate in Zurich, they gave us new Boarding cards with other seats across the whole plane. As we flew with our children, my wife and me would like to sit next to them. But United couldn't change the seats, so we had to accept it. Finally in the plane, most of the flight attendants were very rude, there was just one friendly FA on board. The food tasted horrible. It was the worst I've ever eaten in my whole life. Also the wifi didn't work. During the flight, the FA's were gone, we couldn't order something to drink and all the rubbish had to go into the seat pocket. Just before landing they handed out something like a Leach-Pizza piece.

I had all the necessary paperwork, carrier, and I had purchased the dog a ticket as instructed (note: this was my first time flying with my dog on a United flight, I usually fly JetBlue with her). When I go to board the woman scanning my ticket said she was changing my seat for me. I said ""thank you"" thinking that would be a nice gesture, but I was wrong. Once on board she came on the plane and told me that I was not allowed to sit in that seat (the one she changed me to) with a pet because it had no seat in front of it to stow the animal. I asked if I could move back to my original seat and she told me no. The flight attendants, as well as other people on the plane tried to talk her into letting me change my seat and she still refused, called a manager, and proceeded to kick me off of my flight. It was the most HORRIFIC experience in my entire life. She booked me on a later flight and forgot to transfer my dog over to that ticket, so when I boarded the later flight they were giving me a difficult time having the dog. This I do understand because they didn't have a record of it. However, once we got it all sorted out and everything was fine, they attendants refused to give me any water or take my trash. It was like I never existed on the flight! I am blown away by how inconsiderate and rude United was to me. From the ticket lady to the flight attendants on my later flight. It seems that across the board they value unprofessional behavior. I am originally from NJ so I do understand the somewhat lack of compassion inside the actual airport, but that isn't something that should transfer over to the airline or flight. ";NEGATIVE

So I had to check the bag, which I was NEVER told about a baggage charge, two of us flying, 4 bags checked - $120.00!!! Then, I understood the small aircraft to Houston, but to Aspen? Seriously? I will say the staff on the second flight was very nice but the pretzels served, all 5 of them (yes sarcasm), the pretzels were smaller than my fingernail but what really made me disgusted was when they were picking up the trash, we noticed they stacked the plastic drinking cups, trust me they were cocktail size cups, later they came by offering water & I realized they simply rinsed the cups!";NEGATIVE

When I let the United Airlines representative know I was a Costa Rican citizen she asked if my 12 year old and 2 year old “where Costa Rican citizens as well” when I told her no she continued to ask if “they had same father, because I’d need consent from them to leave the country” I thought that question was extremely rude and felt she asked me that only because of my ethnicity due to the fact she asked if I spoke English right from the start without me even speaking!

Santa Rosa was fogged in, told me I could take a shuttle or drive myself to San Francisco to make my connecting flight, but would not comp the shuttle ride, even though the other airlines were and no compensation for the fact that I was only using half of the flight I paid for. On my way back to Santa Rosa from Portland they delayed my flight by 3 hours, once again with no notice sent to me, and then made my lay over in San Fran 4.5 hours. When I asked for my luggage to take another shuttle since I only live an hour and a half away, they told me I would have to wait 2 hours to get it. They said I could pick it up in Santa Rosa since it would fly with or without me on the plane. I agreed and took the shuttle to Santa Rosa. When I got to the Santa Rosa airport, I went to United and asked about picking up my bag, they said that I could not pick it up after 6pm because they were closed but could deliver my bag to me instead, they took my address name and phone number as well as my bag number. I watched them (I could see and read the screen) pull up my bag info in their system and attach it to an email with all my information and directions on delivering my bag next day to my address between 6-8pm. 6-8pm comes and call the airline, get the run around about them saying that the person I spoke to never submitted a claim, and they have no record of the email that I watched him send being sent. Had to repeatly insist on speaking to a supervisor before being put through only to end up still without any idea of when or if I'll get my luggage back.

I have flown with them to Shanghai in the summer of 2017 and the flight was not only delayed by 13 hours but they also kept us on the plane for 8 of those hours without providing us any reasoning or even doing the simple act of giving us water. And today, my flight to Chicago was delayed so I missed my connecting flight to Hartford which I had to rebook and now that second flight is also delayed. Get your act together United, you seem to be the only airline that just can’t figure it out.";NEGATIVE

I asked for the opportunity to put it the bag sizer. I knew it would fit because I was previously asked to do this. This United employee would not allow me to do that.

When I called to report this, they directed me to contact the Charlotte Airport United Airlines Baggage Counter desk that was supposed to be open from 8 AM to 12 Midnight. There was nobody there & after waiting for over 15 minutes, I went to the United counter who paged the baggage guy. This person came to the counter & was extremely rude to me.

This would not have been an issue but I checked with an United airline agent on two separate contacts days prior to our departure. Our initial flight was accommodating as we had a handicapped person with us but upon arrival to Dulles our airport agent was very unfriendly and of no assistance to a ticketing issue.

Made us low life ""discount"" ticket purchasers wait while 30 people on stand by got called up individually, got their ticket, and boarded in front of us with their aisle and window seats. Absolutely pointless. They really go out of their way. If they want to exhibit vein-popping fury when you got a meager $20 discount for the basic economy ticket that was $500 then they should stop offering such services and just let themselves get beat out by better options.

We wanted to sit next to one another as most married couples do. Fast forward to today when we used the United Airline app to check in and download our boarding passes. Once we had gotten them and started to look them over guess what we found out? Our seats had been changed. When we called to verify we were told by someone not speaking very good English that since the plane was changed our seats had to be changed. I asked if this plane had seats 3A and 3B on it. We were told that indeed it did, but those were already occupied. We were then told that we agreed to ""any necessary changes in planes or seat assignments"" when we agreed to the ""terms and conditions"" of our ticket purchase. Since we don't have any way of changing airlines at such a late date we will have to live with not sitting in the same row as we had planned. This is the second time in as many first class flights that United has done this to us. I guess someone paid more money or had better connections then we did.

I had called with in an hour of purchasing the tickets when I had realized the time was not going to work for me and was told there were not any other flights just that I would have to purchase a more expensive ticket to get what I would want. So I decided to try and make it work and one thing lead to another and I didn’t make it to the interview.

I asked whether I could buy food and she asked what I wanted and left, my husband didn't even get a chance to order something himself. When the flight attendant came back with my food, my husband ordered something and I overheard one flying attendant saying to the other ""now the guy also wants something"" in a bad tone. Seriously? Also, there was no restriction on carry-on baggage size, so people had such oversized carry-ons that all the compartments were basically full before half of the people had entered the plane. On my way back the seats didn't even have screens! I felt like I was in the 90s. And there was no fresh food available, only snacks to purchase. One of the flight attendants was super unfriendly.

Legroom/seat pitch was the smallest I've experienced. When I asked the flight attendant if there was a better seat available, and if so what the upcharge might be, he offered to move me to a seat with a vacant center seat so that I could sit crossways with my legs under the middle seat. After an hour or so ""restless leg syndrome"" set in, a very unusual condition for me, and remained for the duration of the flight. I spent the last hour plus standing up. I should add that there were legroom seats available, but not offered. I strongly resent being required to pay $100 plus for such an upgrade, even if it had been offered. The seat pitch in economy is absolutely unacceptable for me. I also resent being required to pay for any video.";NEGATIVE

He offered an upgrade for $99 and refused to change my seat until I paid this. I paid it, but the process took over 20 minutes when he was unable to communicate well enough to take down my billing information (both the CC number and the address were taken incorrectly more than once). His English was only marginal. The process was extremely aggravating and I resent being required to pay extra for adequate legroom. If the airline had clearly communicated their available legroom on the original booking, I would have booked another airline with more. I will spare no effort to avoid flying United Airlines again.

Now you not only have to pay for food but you also are provided with no entertainment in a 4-hour flight, unless you pay for Direct TV. The worst part is you are forced to pay with credit card if you want to see old movies such as The Lion King or Office Space. How can they rip you off that badly? They force to travel like sardines, they have no empty seats so checking in and out of flights involves standing in long lines to make sure that when you get on board your carry-on luggage will have space. They keep asking us for our cooperation because of a full flight. What do they do to make sure we have an enjoyable flight? We have to pay for food if we want it, pay for entertainment and suffer through the entire flight with the extra tiny space that they have given us in, for example, a Boeing 737. We, us customers, deserve a little better than this. Now you pay for checked bags, what are they going to charge us next? It needs to stop.";NEGATIVE

Customer service is the worst, if you would like to prevent your bags from being destroyed, it's best to pack light and carry on the plane, or check in your bag at the airplane. I purchased a bran new bag before flying and United destroyed it. Im not someone that flies all the time, so I didn't know I needed to get this taken care of within 24 hours, flying for the first time in 10 years and flying to Chicago was scary and it was a business trip. So I decided to wait until I got back to Richmond as I figured my bag would just get destroyed more. Once in Richmond the lady in the baggage desk for United just wanted to argue with me that the quality of my bag wasnt good. Didn't even apologize that United destroyed my bag.

Once we were all.seated and the main door was closed, the captain came on the PA to announce that there was a mechanical issue that would take at least an hour to fix. We all disembarked and general panic set in amongst those of us who were connecting in Houston. The experienced flyers amongst us understood that a one hour mechanical delay is usually the precursor to a cancelled flight, a missed connection, and an overnight stay in Houston. The harried gate agents began to reschedule connecting passengers. They had made some progress with the long line of nervous customers when at exactly one hour later, the head agent came on the PA to announce that a hydraulic leak had been repaired and that we were ready to reboard and depart for IAH. On both flights, I had the window seat in the forward over-wing emergency exit with the middle seat unoccupied. This is the seat I always reserve because the leg room is awesome and the passenger in front of you can't recline into your space. On the IAH-SJO flight I had the whole row to myself, which in some aspects is better than getting upgraded to 1st class. Pretzels and beverages were distributed efficiently on both flights, and more elaborate snacks and meals were available for purchase.

united-airlines;2017-10-27;" |  Los Angeles to Philadelphia via Chicago. United used to be a good airline company. In the past, if you’d book a coach seat, you would have a carry-on and a check-in bag included, and if you had an extra bag, it was still ok, no extra fee. You would get a free meal, and the entertainment, although it was on the minimalist side (because technology was not what it is today), was properly working (at least, most of the time). Not anymore. Today, well, where do I start? You book a basic economy seat for a price that is proportionally the same as for an economy flight in the past, and you have to pay for virtually every single thing on top of that. Only one small item allowed with you on the plane (I guess United figured that you might need a pair of extra underwear and socks if you go to the other side of the country) and they will give you a hard time if you bring a second one (like your camera bag, for instance). Which means that, if you bring a small item with you, along with a luggage of carry-on size, they will ask you to check that luggage in and you will have to pay a $25 fee. If you have an actual check-in luggage on top, that will be considered second check-in luggage, an extra $35. If you book a round trip, that’s already an extra $120 on top of your ticket price. Now, note that I am traveling alone. Imagine being in that situation with a family. Once you are on the plane, no meal other than the usual boring pretzels and a glass of cheap soda or juice. Prices for extra food/drinks are, of course, comfortably marked-up (food and drinks that are of questionable quality). I’m not even mentioning the ever missing extra blankets despite the still totally dysfunctional temperature management on the plane. Now, moving onto the entertainment part: extraordinarily, United has managed to make the ticket payer, use your own electronic devices and ear sets, so they can save thousands of dollars by not having to build-in an entertainment system for your plane section. How amazingly smart is that? Instead, they royally connect you to their internal server (of course, if you want real internet, it’s extra. And not cheap) and allow you to download a ridiculously impractical software plug-in that, if you ever finally manage to download and use it, turns out to be the worst piece of garbage I’ve ever used on a plane to watch a movie. I eventually had to stop the experience. You simply can’t deal with a movie that is so chopped up by the constant disconnections from the server that it becomes literally unwatchable. By the way, absolutely zero electric or USB plug anywhere around your seat to recharge your devices. Only in selective rows. So, what comes next, United? Paying to use the toilets on the plane? Charging a fee to bring our own device? Another fee to have a reclining seat? Where does it end? How much money can you still manage to save on the back of the customer? Lately, almost every single time I took a United flight, I felt they were simply trying to squeeze every dollar out of the customer. I couldn’t wait to get out of the plane. Yes, you can always say other companies pull their own tricks on customers, that you have expenses, that the market is bad, etc. I travel all over the world, and many companies that belong to so-called “developing countries” are better than United Airlines and treat their customers better than they do.

I finally got us on an alternative flight leaving earlier after waiting for 30 minutes to speak with a supervisor because the person I initially spoke with had no power to do anything to help. We ended up flying Alaska Airlines on the way there and I wish we had originally booked through them because the way back was awful. They wouldn't seat my partner and I together because we were flying Economy class, which they reminded us of repeatedly when I complained. The agents claimed they had no power to do anything because of the computer system which randomly selects your seats. I asked what about people traveling with small children and they didn't seem to have an answer. As if we got a better deal than with any other airline out there after all the bag fees. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The Economy class/the majority of the people flying have no carryon allowance. By the way, when we got on the flight we were able to sit next to each other because the seats next to us weren't even occupied. Ridiculous. Never flying United again.

united-airlines;2017-10-16;" | My last trip on United Airlines left me feeling angry, tricked, humiliated and disrespected. The new Basic Economy fair offered by United appears to be a marketing trick to make their lowest fair seem competitive with other airlines' basic fares. They are not when you consider the grab for further dollars one experiences at the airport kiosk by attendants stationed there for no other reason than to hold one's boarding pass hostage until they can very strictly put one through a bag measurement process almost certainly designed to fail most bags. When I made my airline selection for this trip, I had three acceptable airline choices for what seemed to be comparable economy fares, with similar measurement maximums for one's allowable personal item. I selected United for no other reason than their fare and bag seemed to match the others, but I liked the flight time slightly better. I could have just as easily chosen either of the other two airlines. Had I known the ugliness and embarrassment that they cause me in front of my daughter due to their extortion of further funds at the kiosk, I would certainly have chosen one of the other two. United seems to continually hate and disrespect their customers with policies and procedures designed to humiliate them for needing to fly on a budget due either to family or other commitments. When I left home, I carefully measured both my and my 11 year old daughter's personal items. Aside from the wheels on her very small child's size suitcase, both items fit the measurements. I put my purse inside my personal item, such that between the two of us we had exactly two items. The Basic Economy fare does not allow one to check in online before getting to the airport. One is forced to print one's boarding pass at the airport kiosk. When one arrives at the kiosk, one cannot complete the boarding pass process with having an attendant approve final printing of the pass by checking the size of the personal item, then scanning his/her badge to unlock the system. The attendant had no problem with our personal items when we left our home airport. We arrived at our destination without incident. United immediately sent me an option to review my leaving flight, but I wanted to wait until we returned home. Returning home from Dallas international airport a few days later was a completely different story. I had to get up in the middle of the night to return our rental car and make a 6am flight. When we arrived at the kiosk, the attendant put us through a rigorous bag measuring process. A zipper on my personal item kept catching on the metal, but I was able to get the bag into the box. I was very tired from having gotten up in the middle of the night, and forgot to put my purse into my personal item. I had to struggle to stuff it in at the last minute. My daughter's very small suitcase fit exactly, except for the small wheels. The suitcase fit with plenty of room to spare on the way to Dallas. The kiosk attendant stated that the measurement requirements had nothing to do with whether or not the item fit under the seat, meaning they were in place solely as a justification to get more money. Once I paid for the bag, the attendant didn't even finish printing our boarding passes. I had to get another attendant to finish printing them. The attendants are there for no other purpose than to collect more money by scrupulously measuring bags. They are not there for any benefit to the customer whatsoever. Despise United.";NEGATIVE

No idea why United has such planes degrading their name. You had the feeling that you were sitting on a seat that belonged on the dump. The only good thing I can say is that the flight attendant was friendly. Going to the bathroom the lock jammed. The handle fell off. I was glad that I had not locked the door when I saw this. I decided that I did not need to go. The enclosed picture shows the general state of this horrid plane.;NEGATIVE

The United Airlines credit card has $95 annual fee, which is high, but if I get priority seating and 1 free bag, it will be worth it. When I check in, none of what they told me is true. Not only that, I could not check in my very small backpack on wheels because basic economy does not allow any carry on that fits in the overhead bin. No matter how much money I was willing to pay extra to keep my very small bag, smaller than airline regulation size bag with me, it was not an option and I had to pay $25 for the first checked bag and $35 for the second checked bag.

Once I scanned my ticket I was told I had to check my bag, there were still about 40 people waiting to board the plane. When asked why I received attitude of ""it just does, there is no room on the plane."" As I get on the plane I notice empty overhead bins everywhere and as I am walking down I see that a majority of the bags are small personal items. Purses, small backpacks, plastic bags. So basically I had to check my bag because United fails to enforce policy and as well prematurely calls the aircraft ""full"". The whole point of me traveling light is so that I do not have to check my bag as this is one of the biggest headaches about traveling. I'll tell you I have never had this issue on competing airlines. Judging by the reviews of 3/10 I'd say that is accurate.

Because it was so last minute, I was looking for cheap tickets and United had the best deal. I booked a 5:50 AM flight back to San Francisco in order to land and get to work. Having flowing in and out of McCarran International Airport quite frequently on early morning flights, I knew that I should be able to move through things fairly quickly. I arrived at the airport at 5:05 AM. I went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and was stopped. United Airlines employees told me that I was too late to get on my 5:50 AM flight, and that I would have to wait in the ticketing line to rebook my flight. I kept trying to explain to them that at I still had over forty-five minutes until my flight left and that I wasn't checking any baggage, but they wouldn't listen to me. Instead, they forced me to stand in a ticketing line for 20 minutes by which point it really was too late for me to make the flight. When I got to the counter the woman rebooking me acted as though I was checking my back. When I explained that I wasn't, she got what can only be described as an ""oh no"" look on her face. Then, she very apologetically explained to me that a mistake had been made, and that I should have been permitted to pass through and get on the flight. Apparently, despite having tried to explain the exact same thing multiple times to the other employees they chose to stop me anyway. I had missed the cut off for passengers trying to check luggage (45 mins) but not for people just trying to print their boarding pass and go straight through to the flight (30 mins). What made it even more frustrating was that I arrived in the terminal at the gate for my first flight before it had even taken off. At that point, I should have been offered some sort of compensation for the wasted time, but United didn't give me anything. I filed an official complaint on the website, but unfortunately I don't have any proof of what actually happened, and so I don't expect that it will be resolved in my favor. I definitely will not be flying them again if I can avoid it.";NEGATIVE

In the end there's nothing negative I can think of to mention about my experience with United Airlines.

I called customer services and at first they were quite polite on the phone until they told me I had to pay a cancelation fee of US$100. So, I said OK, what if we do not cancel the flight, but just don’t board the plane? They responded by saying I would still have to pay US$100. I asked why? UA will be able to resell the seats and I am not asking for a refund. Then she started being condescending and patronizing. I was outraged by their logic and treatment.

We usually fly Delta, but booked these tickets later than usual and Delta flights from DSM were limited. I cannot believe any company would think it's is a good idea to force families or groups to not sit together. Even if there is extra room on the aircraft, they will not allow you to change seats. Tried online, tried when checking on at front desk, tried prior to boarding at the gate. These tickets were not basement bargains by any means. We were disappointed with United two years ago (last time we flew them), now we are absolutely disgusted. I don't care if you hold off on assigning seats until at the gate, for your ""cheapest tickets"". But if there are empty seats in the economy cabin, let families, groups, kids, parents, and couples, have the opportunity to sit next to eachother. Really, it does not matter, for you will never have our business again. And we will be strongly encouraging others to follow suit. We tried your services again expecting sub par service, and honestly were even more disappointed. Please stay away from this airline. Worst on the business, does care about it's customers.

The FA apologized up and down to him, advising him on how he could get some compensation and telling him how sorry she was. I was sitting there with a soaking wet six-year old. I told the FA that she put the drink down and it slid right off the tray. She proceeded to give me a lecture about how there's an indented part of the tray specifically for glasses and that when an airplane is ascending, it is on an angle - talking to me - a seasoned 1K or Global Services flier with United - as if I'm the six-year old.

This was fine, I would not be able to carryon or handle checked luggage anyway because of recent shoulder surgery. I shipped my things via UPS to my destination. I had no problems from CVG to ORD other than the plane being delayed an hour – no big deal. The problem was when I got to ORD for the return trip. When I got to the airport they would not give me a boarding pass to get through security because I had a small purse and a 13"" laptop case. They interpreted the rule as only 1 carryon which was my purse. I brought both of them from CVG to ORD with no problem but in ORD I could not take the laptop. My purse was considered my 1 bag. I talked to 2 people and they both refused me. I tried to get them to let me take it to the gate for their checking but was refused that also. I could not check the laptop in the hold because it was a flimsy case that would not take the beating of the conveyor belt and it had a lithium battery. I had to leave my laptop with a friend to express ship to me at a great cost. I found this whole incident outrageous and unacceptable. You should not let people get through half of their trip and then enforce some policy and you should make this clear when buying the ticket that a purse is considered your carryon.";NEGATIVE

We’d chosen row 8 and boarding was painless and we were soon enjoying a pre take off Mimosa, having stowed the Saks of Fifth Avenue bedding. Menus were handed out and crew came and took orders for mains before take off. The seat was spacious and comfortable. This was a brunch flight and crew came out with a trolley to make signature Bloody Marys and Mimosas which were served with warm nuts. Meal service with a delicious smoked salmon starter was followed by a succulent steak with scrambled eggs and potatoes. After the cheese plate a United sundae was served, drinks were regularly topped up by crew who were absolutely outstanding, and friendly. Great inflight entertainment and a nice range of snacks were available and about an hour before landing lunch was served which was roast chicken with cous cous and veg. Flight landed on time at 1110 and thats where the benefit of Dublin security kicked in - we were out of the airport with checked luggage and in our taxi at 1130.

Well the United flight from Chattanooga to Newark was cancelled due to “air traffic problems”. There was never any notification of the cancellation and everyone had to find out at check in. Since I was supposed to be making an international flight, they quickly rebooked me to fly to Chicago, then Frankfurt, then Hamburg. The flight from Chattanooga to Chicago was decent. I had a 4 hour layover in Chicago waiting to board my international flight to Frankfurt. As I was boarding the employees pulled me aside and told me my boarding pass wasn’t valid. They said I was booked going to Stockholm in the computer system. So they didn’t let me board the plane until they could figure out what’s going on. Then the plane closed the door and took off without me because they couldn’t sort out my ticket situation. So whoever rebooked my ticket, did something completely wrong - gave me a boarding pass that wasn’t actually valid, and I missed an overnight international flight. Since the error was 110% due to United’s employees lacking the simple skills to print a valid ticket, I was at least given a hotel room for the night. Unbelievable that this would happen.";NEGATIVE

They were not able to seat us together despite I asked when checking in and on the plane. The plane was not full. This is the first time an airline place my kids away from me. One kids fell sleep and the other came up to me on my middle seat. The guy next to me tried to help and moved one row forward to the emergency row so my boy could be next to me. Immediately a sour purser came and threw him back as the emergency row is a premium seat on United. I understand their policy but do think the purser could have helped. Lounge food is very low quality compared to Lufthansa or BA. We are gold and silver level on SA which seems to be only reason to fly United so you can board early and bring more luggage;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-09-10;" |  I purchased non-refundable round-trip tickets from Boston to San Francisco for my husband and myself to attend my dear cousin's funeral. A day before our scheduled departure, I canceled my husband's flight because he had a bad cold and was coughing too much to get on a plane. In my conversation with United, I was told how to file for a refund (even though my tickets were non-refundable). I traveled to San Francisco myself. The direct flight both ways went fine, but the return flight was remarkable. By chance, I ended up sitting next to my sister and brother-in-law who were returning to Boston from the same funeral. We chatted with one of the flight attendants who knew we were returning from a funeral. She was exceptionally kind and gave us complimentary snacks. Her kindness was greatly appreciated during our bereavement. After I returned home, I filled out the online Refund form to see about getting a refund for my husband's ticket. I explained that not only was he coughing too much to get on a plane for six hours but it would have been very inconsiderate to other passengers for him to be hacking away. United Airlines was kind enough to promptly issue a refund for my husband's unused round-trip fare - a full refund, not a credit for future travel. I appreciate the refund - the thought of having to pay for an unused round-trip ticket for a funeral would only add insult to injury. I am grateful to United Airlines for making a very unpleasant situation (me traveling across the country alone, without my husband, for my cousin's funeral) as comfortable and pleasant as they could.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-09-09;" | I travel frequently and United consistently lacks in quality compared to American, Southwest and Frontier. The customer service here needs serious improvement, for example today I asked a flight attendant if there was any room left in overhead compartments for my carry on (even though this is still 7 minutes or so until boarding ends and all of the compartments had been closed early) very kindly and politely and the response was completely rude and dismissive to my question she told me ""that can comfortably fit under your seat, in the most condescending offensive tone"" well I am a 5'10"" woman whose knees already touch the seat in front of me and would like to be able to enjoy my flight. She acted like it was too much to ask and so I then had to be uncomfortable unnecessarily on a flight that I paid for. So instead of arguing about it, as it was not worth my time and energy I then said forget it and then just bitterly deal with it the rest of the flight. I am very disappointed with the quality of this service, it's a Friday afternoon and the last thing anyone wants is to start their weekend feeling annoyed.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-09-07;" |  My daughter and I were flying business class from San Francisco to Boston on United night flight. We both had 2 bags weighing of which one was weighing 67lbs and the other ones 70lbs. Upon check in, someone who acted like the manager in charge helps us get the baggage tags from a machine and then put our bags on the scale. He told us they were overweight and that we had to pay for the extra lbs. We did not agree because we had weighed the bags before and they were good to go. An argument started and the man became very rude to us. Then we took the bags and put them on another counter scale and the weights were exactly like the ones we had measured ourselves before going to the airport. Then my daughter started taking pictures of the scales and suddenly another employee came to us and said ""don't worry it's ok you can go""! Apparently, the company seems to use inaccurate scales to get some extra money from voyagers. This is unacceptable and I am filing a complaint with the company. My advice is that you weigh your bags before going to the airport and once there ask to double check on different scales.";NEGATIVE

To be fair though, and to set aside all my prior experiences I will review the flight from a fresh slate. The aircraft, a 17 year old 777 with the old Continental interior. There was personal in seat IFE but it was slow and unresponsive. The movies that were available were recent and best sellers. I was very happy to see that the drink cart was busted out maybe 4 times during the flight and about every hour there was an FA distributing water. Flight was only about 20 minutes. Food itself was a choice between western and asian meal. To be honest, none of the meals were good. But what kills me the most about United is the horrible customer service, flight attendants are all rude and cold. No matter how decent the actual flight may be, the FA's ruin the experience.";NEGATIVE

It amazes me how you can wait for an hour to rebook a flight only to have the gate attendant look at the line and say ""we have other flights to deal with, if you were on the moved / delayed flight, take it somewhere else. We're not dealing with any more of you."" Made it to the next gate and had to convince that attendant just to check and see if I'd make a 10pm connection. Her answer was ""no"" and she seemed to think her job was complete. Waiting on hold and in lines for hours just to be told I won't make it home. No effort whatsoever to actually rebook or solve the problem. Of course no compensation or hotel was offered after finally rebooking for the next morning after being on hold with United for almost an hour. Pay hundreds of dollars for a service, and they truly seem to have no to minimum interest in actually delivering that service to you.";NEGATIVE

The flights were fine, left on time, and arrived early. No surprises with our seats, or food (we brought our own). On the way home, I even got to upgrade my seats, not all the way to first class, but at least closer to the front. The staff were all pleasant, so no complaints. However, a day after our arrival at our destination, my daughter called and asked if I had some of her underwear. I said no, they must have been left at home. She said no, that she remembered packing them. However, I wanted to wait until I got home to make sure that we hadn't just left them. When I got home 2 days later and they weren't there, I called United. I was told very rudely that because I hadn't called within 24 hours of the flight, I couldn't make a claim. I told him that I wasn't interested in monetary reparation, I just wanted to make the complaint to let them know that they had a pervert baggage handler somewhere. He was still rude and said that they couldn't do anything because I didn't call within 24 hours of the flight's arrival. Really?? No shock and horror at one of their employees stealing?  United blew it at the last moment. No wonder so many people refuse to fly United, including 3 of my family members who fly all the time for work. Now I will join them in this boycott.";NEGATIVE

My Washington inbound flight was delayed on Sep, 1st and now, Sep, 4th I am sitting for 3 hours in the boarding room waiting for guess what, another United delayed flight. Remark: Both cases caused by aircraft maintenance. Ground staff answer to questions about food was the best: ""Oh, Sure, we can provide water and some snacks""! The pictures show the snacks and the quantity, it was a great exercise to get one for my wife and another for myself. Hoping for better regulations to make this business more serious.

united-airlines;2017-09-04;" |  London Heathrow to Chicago. I booked through Travelup and thought I was on an Air Brussels flight and I discover it was United Airlines one. At check in I was impressed by all the help while taken aback to be asked the address I was staying. I unfortunately gave them an old address out of my address book which I then had to somehow correct, the staff reassured me with address labels. The staff on the plane seemed older. I started to be unimpressed when I found myself sitting in a seat that had a yellow sticker on its arm indicating that the inflight entertainment would not work from that seat. The staff alerted technical support who confirmed this so I and other passengers were given the opportunity to sit in any other spare seat. What unimpressed me was the staff could not get the inflight entertainment to work for any of us, we were given the option of buying into their wifi service (about $25) which out of principle I was not going to do, especially when the staff commented it was a bit intermittent anyway and there was no way of recharging my ipad as there is no USB port at the seat. I asked if they had any magazines, no. As compensation we were, at the end of the journey, alerted to their online 'appreciation' service. This I duly filled in, however their site did not allo me to put in my uk county for my address so i had to lie to make the page move forward and say IL for Illinois where I am staying. Promptly I had an offer of $100 offered me towards another United Airlines flight to be used within a year, which is not something I will use. ";NEGATIVE

We sat at gate on plane for almost an hour before finally being cleared. Our connecting flight was to leave Chicago at 12:15, there were about 8-10 of us just on this flight due to be on same connecting flight. We arrived and ran as fast as possible to get to the gate and got there at 12:06 and gate was already closed. Their delay in first place caused us to be late and yet they couldn't wait a few min for us to get there. Plane was still at gate, luggage still being loaded etc. so in a nutshell their plane leaving an hour late wasn't an issue but waiting 6-8 minutes for 8-10 passengers to arrive due to their issue late by 6 min wasn't good enough. United never again.";NEGATIVE

We bought the tickets from expedia and we had no forewarning. At the check in kiosk we found out about this new rule. We checked in our carry on much to our annoyance about not receiving any previous warnings. At the gate my husband had his suit in a hanger and a backpack on him and the employees were rude and obnoxious before we even got a chance to talk. The employee immediately started baddegering us about receiving 17 alerts about no the more than one item per person rule. When we tried to explain we bought the ticket from expedia and didnt receive any warning, she went on to imply that we were lying! Another employee had to intervene and let us through (as if they were giving us a pass) This is ridiculous! Make an announcement if you are changing policies! When we entered the airplane was hot while we were being seated. No air! Till we took off for 40 minutes. This experience is the worst I have ever had and my family or I will never fly United ever again.";NEGATIVE

Two flights each way to Hawaii, and on all 4 flights the film entertainment simply buffered beyond belief after 30 minutes and the wifi failed completely eventually. I would have been even more annoyed if I'd paid $9.99 to borrow a screen. On the last leg of the flight home, we persevered with a film and it took us 3 and a half hours to get through it!

It wasn't stellar service but it fulfilled the minimum requirements. More importantly, on the way back we had to change planes when we were already seated because there was an electrical problem and United managed to prepare a replacement aircraft in just over 2 hours, which I found impressive. I don't think flying through the US is the best option to fly to Canada, but I would probably fly United again to Canada via Dulles if I could not find an affordable flight that is direct.";POSITIVE

Was told and shown that we all had seats together. This is very important considering we are flying with young children. We receive our boarding passes and see that all of us are separated. Uhm no. The lady at the gate was incredibly rude and seemed as if we were a bother, pretty sure it's her job to help customers. She told us ""it's ok, you are all near one another anyways so it's not a big deal."" Not a big deal? Excuse me! We board the plane, my 3 year old daughter who has never flown before has a seat between two adult males. I question one stewardess about this, she tells me, ""oh it's fine she can sit there and you are back here and you'll be able to see her."" Well I don't know about you but I'm pretty sure I can't see through the bathrooms and around the corner! I then not so nicely told her that she must be losing her mind if she thinks I'm going to let my 3 year old daughter sit on an airplane for 2.5 hours in between two strangers and out of my eyesight. Her response, ""ma'am, you need to sit down in your assigned seats."" and walked away. Attempting to control the anger that was bubbling up from my insides I found another stewardess who was able to help me and have people change seats so I could sit by my daughter. My sister had the same encounter with the same stewardess about her children. Absolutely ridiculous! What airline thinks it's ok to place a small child alone between two strangers on an airplane? The employees at the concourse were rude and unhelpful. We had checked in online to save some time, not sure why because when we arrived we had to check in again at the kiosk. We were then told we were all TSA pre checked and to proceed to that area.  Except, we weren't. Only 2 of us were and those 2 were the 3 and 5 year old. Because that makes sense doesn't it? Let's send a 3 and 5 year old through security alone. So then after finding this out we then had to walk all the way back down to the ""regular"" security. Flight after all of this was uneventful. On our trip home we were delayed over 7 hours due to weather in Chicago. I can't hold United accountable for this as I am a smart and rational person and realize they have 0 control over the weather. We were all given $15 vouchers to get food and drink while we waited for our flight. Which was great, except the vouchers didn't work. For any of us on that flight. The computer system wouldn't recognize the voucher and would lock up. So we were not able to get those over priced $12 chicken strips.  I was unimpressed with this airline. Horrible customer service. Horrible employees. Horrible experience. We will never fly United again. Ever.";NEGATIVE

The last few tripsI have used United Airlines due to finding the cheapest ticket available. It wasn't worth it. Once on the plane, things are okay. You get the usual economy service for the price. a cramped seat, and service of beverage and a small snack. Getting onto their planes is an issue. Out of the last 4 planes I've been on with United, 2 of flights had gotten cancelled, including my most recent flight from two days ago. One of those four was a 3 hour delay with bright, sunny skies. Apparently there was a mechanical issue. So one out of four flights I had actually been able to board on time as scheduled. Not a good record! For both cancelled flights (the one two days ago, and one in January 2017) they refused to assist with paying hotel fees, even when it was an ""air traffic problem"". They also provide very little notice of cancellation. I was at the gate both times about 20 minutes from boarding, late at night. So I have to scramble to find another another flight and a hotel when its very late. Their lines are long and slow to get through. Calling them is hardly better as there seems to not be an option to wait on hold. Two nights ago I called, then was promptly informed by the automated system that the lines were too busy and to try again later before being disconnected. Not even a callback option! Just ""call back later"" before it hung up. I had to pull strings with a family member who is a travel agent to assist me in getting a flight while everyone else waited for hours. I realize some of this waiting cannot be avoided, but its simply ridiculous. Overall, this airline treats its customers very poorly.

I cannot shorten my legs so I am forced to purchase premium seating now. Each of these 2 flights required connections, the connecting flights were cancelled so we had to spend 7 hours and 8 hours - respectively - sitting in connecting city airports. Since the flights were canceled for mechanical or flight crew issues, there was nothing to be done. I waited in line at customer service but United Customer Service told me I was in the wrong place to file a complaint! So I complained online and I was sent a measly $100 voucher - which I won't be using, since I will never fly United again.

After half the day at the airport we were told to book another flight. Lines after lines at the United podium we were told that it would not be much longer, couldn't get another flight. After 10 hours of waiting at the airport we finally got notice that our original plane was about to approach. Then we found out that they had switched my ticket to another plane than my husbands. We booked out first class tickets together with seats next to each other. After more long lines we finally got them to put on the same flight but they did not put us sitting together. We were supposed to be in Bozeman, Mt at 1pm but finally after all of United's fiasco we arrived at 11pm and missing one of our bags that was checked. It arrived 4pm the next day.

I didn't press any buttons and I planned to wait, but their automated system said ""great, we'll give you a call back"" and the call was ended. So I waited 50 minutes and never got a call. I am trying to call again now. This time it didn't give me the option of a call back. It just said it'll be over 30 minutes and hold music began playing. I have now been on hold for an hour and 34 minutes. I'm still waiting for someone to answer this phone and have no idea how much longer it'll take. I cannot stand when companies don't have enough staff at their overseas call centers. I flew once with United in July (that was my first time ever flying with them) and my flight got cancelled then too. I've flown American, Southwest, JetBlue, and Delta and have never had a flight cancelled in my life. Flew twice with United (once in July, once in August) and both times they've been cancelled.

Of course that put a sour taste in my mouth and as I attempt to leave today I was advised (an hour and a half before the flight was supposed to leave) the flight would be delayed for 2 hours. I am missing my connecting flight and will have to spend an entire day/night in the airport, miss work, and be completely miserable. This being the end of my trip I have absolutely no clean clothes and being a student I have no extra money for food and those sort of expenses. I will never fly this airline again.

We received our boarding passes minutes later only to learn the seats had not changed. Do not tell me that something has been taken care of in order to get me off the phone and make your job ""easier"". I would have respected the truth much more than this lack of integrity.

On the fourth person who was a supervisor, I asked to check on my seat assignment and was told I had to be transferred to yet another person. I waited 30 minutes to talk to that person, with no option for a call back like the other airlines offer, only to be told that they could not change my seat to an aisle or a middle seat without a $160 fee. Almost half of the economy seats were economy plus, so even though they were available, they could not be assigned to ticketed passengers. I fly 15-20 times per year, mostly on American, Southwest and Delta. I have had pleasant experiences with all of these airlines. Never have I dealt with an airline with such incompetent rude staff only to have that conversation end with an explanation of a bad policy that I should have been able to get from the first - or even the 5th - person I talked to.

The man next to my mom was bumped up to first class so she asked if her husband could move up to sit next to her (as he was originally going to according to her reserved, confirmed ticket) and the stewardess said no because that seat costs extra money.

We ran (I kid you not) 0.7 miles across the airport from gate B to E. When we got to the gate (we made it 2 minutes after the gate closed), they said they could only let 1 of us on. When I asked why, the lady hesitated and said they couldn't let anyone in the gate after it closed. But she let one of us on, so that made no sense. Found out they gave our other 2 seats away. Wouldn't they know we had a connecting flight that was tight on a layover time? Well, we went to customer service and she says ""You had 8 minutes to get to your gate. Did you get lost?"" Are you kidding me? She wouldn't comp us a hotel or anything. Said they weren't liable. She couldn't get us on any flights until the following day at 11pm. Well, she ended up getting us to Denver (our other connection) on separate flights and we rented a car for a day and drove 9 hours to Yellowstone. On our flight back, we had the same flight pattern. Our first flight from Cody was delayed 4 hours due to mechanical errors, causing us to miss the rest of our flights for the day. However, they did get us a hotel in Denver and some meal comp tickets, which I was very grateful for. But why couldn't they do this on the way there? The next morning, our flight from Houston to Charleston was delayed an hour. I have never in my life experienced so many flight issues as I did for this trip.

Don't bother requesting the vegetarian meal and just risk the regular food service where they usually have a meatless pasta/noodle option. The seats in premium economy have a good amount of legroom and the entertainment on board isn't bad either. I think my biggest issue with the experience overall was the disinterest of the flight attendants. After being repeatedly hit by the cart going by and the patronizing tone the FAs used when giving me the veggie meal, it makes you wonder how they continue to use their 'friendly skies' pitch.

I've flow other airlines, and never expected the level of discomfort I found in this plane. Will not fly United again.";NEGATIVE

The only problems that I encountered was severe weather which delayed are flight by 40 mins but they turned the plane around very quickly. Even after the delay I still didn't miss my connection, the second thing was the food on my flight back to London, it wasn't the best but then it wasn't horrible. On both flights the ground staff were helpful and informative, also on both flight the seats were cushioned and had a lot of hip room. The cabin crew on both flights were funny, helpful and informative. The inflight entertainment has a ton of stuff. The wifi was easy to access and has good connectivity. The food and beverages are good but personally I think pasta and mushrooms aren't the best mix. Overall very good value for your money.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-08-18;" |  Phoenix to Syracuse via Newark. I purchased my ticket a month before my departure date. I got to the airport and everything was fine. I paid for my carry on bags and got on the plane. We ended up having to land the plane in Atlanta because of weather. The staff told us we should only have a few hours layover and be back up in the air. A few hours passed by and we were told to board the plane. We all got on and sat for 30 minutes then we're told to get back off because there was no pilot. That itself annoyed me because it's a waste of time. We were told we had to stay in Atlanta. They gave me my carry on bag because everything I needed was in it and since I was going to be stuck in the airport over night I wanted to brush my teeth and use deodorant and have my phone charger to charge my phone. After the staff gave me my carry on bags. I was told I'd have to pay the baggage fee again. This delay and overnight stay in the airport is not my problem and I didn't feel like I should have to pay for my bag again. Ridiculous. I told the staff is there anyway they could accommodate for unexpected food and bag fee to wave it and maybe give me a voucher for food. I was told by all the staff that because I was a solo traveler, that they would not make any exceptions for me and told me they have more important things to deal with. I explained to them that my bank had locked my card because I tried to use it in the airport so I had no money and it was to late to contact my bank. The only cash I had on me had to go towards this carry on bag fee. The staff told me they could not help me and I needed to go find a spot to relax until the next plane had a seat for me. I am extremely upset with the carry on bag fees, the staff were very rude not only to me but everyone. I am upset that we had to sleep in the airport over night with no food or drinks offered to us. No blankets and they charged me another carry on bag fee because I needed my bag due to being stuck in the airport. I will never fly with United Airlines again. Extremely rude staff have no sympathy for people at all.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-08-18; |  Chicago to Burbank via San Francisco booked for November 2017. The customer service I have received through this company has been nothing but terrible.  While on the phone with them they were very rude and couldn't give me any alternate options or help. They only told me to contact costumer service via email. They didn't provide me with an email address and I couldn't find one on the site so I had to use an outside source to find the email. When I contacted via email it took them two weeks to write back to me and another week to reply to my response just to tell me that they couldn't help me at all. This is highly inappropriate. If you wish to run a business then make sure your agents are trained to solve all problems and trained to actually respond to costumers in a timely manner. I also want to add that the website never works and is beyond difficult to navigate. I am beyond upset with the service I was given and I plan to never fly United again. ;NEGATIVE

Now I am still in San Francisco, paying out of my own pocket for a hotel room simply because and I quote ""United policy says if (the delay or cancellation) it is due to weather, there is nothing we can do"" Even though, there is no rain no fog or whatever in San Francisco area at all, and Santa Rosa is right next to it!

Received a text indicating my outbound flight from Toronto was being delayed. The text did not mention I would miss my connection. Luckily I figured this out myself. Not that difficult. Called to re-book and the utterly useless staff members only suggestion was to spend the night in Chicago or leave the next day. I was able to find an alternate route. Toronto/Cleveland/Chicago/South Bend. There was availability on an Air Canada outbound to Chicago but she would not consider this. As time was becoming of the essence and I did not want to miss the possible flight, no time to argue. As it turned out the text message I received was wrong and I would have been able to make my connection. How do I know this? When my Cleveland to Chicago route was delayed I had plenty of time to check Fligthtracker. When I showed this to the agent in Cleveland he said the United Text system is often wrong and in future I should call. Really? Well the good news is I made all my connections. The bad news no bag. The very helpful agent in South Bend advised he had located my bag in Chicago and it would out in the first flight in the morning. He may have been very helpful but not truthful. Woke up this morning. The text message from United said still looking for the bag as did the website. Called the lost baggage number provided, their lost baggage centre is located in India so there were obvious communication difficulties. Not her fault but took about 20 minutes for her to tell me that though the bag was last scanned in Chicago there was no information as to where the bag was. ";NEGATIVE

We boarded the flight, sat in my assigned seat 21C and settled in for the flight home. Suddenly a gate agent boarded the flight and asked me to gather my belongings and exit the flight, this happened without any explanation, I was embarrassed in front of many passengers and told to deplane the aircraft. I was brought to customer services were they finally provided some poor answer that their agent mistakenly did not finish the ticket purchase and that I would not be allowed on their flight. Very rudely their customer service personal basically said we will do you a favor and not charge the $50 rebooking fee, here is a ticket for tomorrow. I requested my bag and they told me it had left with the airplane that I didn't have a ticket for. The most pathetic excuse of an airline I have ever experienced.";NEGATIVE

They are loud, bossy, burnt out and just plain rude. They seem only to be able to manage the absolute minimum of words necessary to convey the intended message, for example, ""Eggs or French toast?"" Yelled at you in military style, then when somebody dared to ask a question, the staff member replied ""Just Choose,"" then continued with, ""that wasn't so hard now, was it?"" Clearly they have forgotten that it is their chosen profession to provide a service and that the general expectation from that service is that it requires a certain amount professionalism, diplomacy, helpfulness and even some basic pleasantries wouldn't go astray. It's really not very nice having your food practically thrown at you. The passenger on the window seat of my row had her sandwich tossed in such a manner that it fell on the floor and she had to scramble around under her seat in the dark to retrieve it, disgusting! I would suggest retraining or maybe a pay rise for inspiration!";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2017-08-09; |  Detroit to Reno via Denver. United Airlines was the most unorganized airline I have ever flown on. They didn't provide good customer service on or off the ground. We arrived well over 3 hours for a domestic flight and no one kept us informed if we would make the flight or not due to the computer problems they were having and could not print tickets. This is understandable but to pick people who were yelling and causing the most commotion as opposed to calming veryone down letting all passengers know that the flight crew is aware of the problem and no one would be missing their flight. When i would try and ask questions i was dismissed without answers and they were rude.  Leaving the trip had a horrible experience with them as well. Again we allowed ourselves plenty of time especially after our first encounter with them. We again waited in line for hours when we finally approached the desk They only let 2 of us check our bags. The other 2 family members they refused to allow them on and had them fly out later that night. I have never encountered such an uncompassionate and unorginized company. I will never fly them again even if the flight is free.;NEGATIVE

My complaint is that I was not given a choice due to being in economy class as they ran out of the other choice. I guess that's what I get for being poor.  The flights were mainly on time, but they were delayed a bit due to things that were out of control. Otherwise, it was reasonable. Customer service was standard and expected. The staff was efficient and friendly enough and were able to answer my questions. They lost my luggage and I was disappointed. But I was able to get my luggage back delivered the next day and the help desk was nice and friendly. Standard amenities, the blankets were thin and did not keep me warm, no extras but for the price, I did not expect any extras. They were the cheapest airline.  Overall it was a good experience, standard and I'm happy I got my bag back so quickly. ";POSITIVE

After 2.5 hours on the plane with a faulty filling of fuel above tank level, the plane system shut down, upon restarting the engines a small fire started and they called the fire trucks to put it off. No maintenance was able to get the flight at such short notice while risking the lives of 550 passengers. We were shuttled back to the airport to spend the night at hotels. This is when the mess started - The instructions from service counter was not through a microphone. messages were mixed up and confusion about who is to go out and who is to stay in and what followed this chaos was really bad. We were told that we will be met by hotel representatives and will get meal coupons. I followed the United Airlines rep. And at passport control I was asked to go back to C terminal (after walking and riding trains to get to it, i found out it was Z and not C that I had to go back to). Some needed a visa to go out to the outside hotels and some didn't. After Finding my way back to Z terminal where United Airlines were supposed to be. nobody was there. Asked Lufthansa service desk and they said we have nothing to do with it. I waited for 7 hours to board this flight then ran around in circles for 3 kilometers and security checks and trains without food and water all day I lost it. I asked Lufthansa to help and find out where do I go for the night. They eventually told me to go to Z22. The United Airlines rep gave me directions to the hotel inside the airport and gave me meal coupons. Stating that the flight is tomorrow at 10am. I checked out of the hotel by 6:30am and waited for further instructions of Service counters which opens by 8am. There was no flight at 10am. They booked some passengers on the 13:55 flight and told us that our flight is now at 17:00. The UA flight 2720 left at 18:00 from Frankfurt. By the way, the UA planes are not equipped with screens and you are required at short notice to download their application to your smartphone and watch movies! Do you expect international travelers to be connected with internet to download applications on the plane to get to the entertainment of your flights? My iPhone was not able to connect and open any movie, barely a slow connection stopping every minute when you access a trailer version of the movie.

I went up and asked the guy st the desk if he knew the boarding time. He literally said ""sit down, I'll make the announcement when I do"". Got on the plane after a uninformed hour delay.

We sat for 23 precious minutes on the tarmac and when we were released from the plane ran to our international gate where we could see our plane only to have the door slammed in our faces followed by an insincere ""I'm sorry"" from the gate crew. Then we had to wait in the customer service line at 10:30 pm for almost two hours to be given paperwork for another flight the next evening that amounted to nothing. The airline wouldn't pay for our hotel of which at midnight cost us $293 for the night. When discussing with United's customer service agent he continually blamed it on weather which was never even an issue.

They would only provide $250 for the forced move to Economy, which is less than I paid for the difference between the two classes. I can only assume that the original aircraft was not oversold... they downgraded the size plane, so they wouldn't have any unsold seats. United Airlines will forever be at the bottom.

The only entertainment is connecting your own device (mobile, tablet or laptop) to their wifi. Now, imagine this: 300+ passengers trying to connect to the same wifi at once. I had to wait until they served the meals and everyone was busy eating to be able to connect. I have to say, later during the flight it was better, but i guess because most people were bored from trying and just went to sleep. I am not a tall person, and I never notice leg room, but not on this flight. It is noticeably crammed. Seats are old and torn in places. I unfolded the tray and seat in front was torn. They provide electrical sockets under the seat. However, due to short leg room, it is very hard to plug anything in, and to even keep it without knocking it out. Food is a disaster. Lame and old, and not properly packaged. It was just wrapped in a plastic sheet, not sealed. The quantity is small. I was never hungry at the end of a flight like this one.";NEGATIVE

Poor entertainment with very limited choice and screens the size of postage stamps with no device charging facilities. Not everyone wants to sleep on a night flight. Also the hot meal was dreadful.

We arrived in Newark with no mishaps and when we went to a United counter to see what gate our connecting flight was leaving from, we were told that flight had been cancelled, but no reason was given. Instead, we were directed to a customer service counter with a very long line and only two agents assisting customers. Come to find out, United cancelled several flights from Newark that day. After standing in line for almost two hours (while also trying to talk to a person on the United hotline number while in line and receiving no help), it was finally my turn to speak to a desk agent. The agent was no help at all, and told me the flight had been cancelled due to weather, and since it was a weather issue, he told me United was not responsible to help with lodging, rental cars, etc. The soonest we could be booked on another flight was the following Monday, July 3. His solution was my family of four was welcome to remain in the airport throughout the weekend. That being an unacceptable option we, and apparently every other United customer affected by cancellations, went to rent a car and finally found a car available to drive to Norfolk. After cancelling our flight, the best they can offer is for us to stay in the airport for two nights and three days? No offer to reimburse, no offer to help with the rental, not offer to reimburse baggage fees. Not even some empathy form the agent. Not flying United again.

The snack was a small sandwich that was smaller than your palm and a mini bag of M&Ms so you feel hungry for most of the flight. Whole atmosphere was unpleasant -  dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable seats, unhappy crews. I was hesitant to choose United but gave it a try because of cheap fare and my prediction was accurate.

At that moment of contact with that Rep I chose to not upgrade as I felt that United does not invest the money that I would have spent to train its employees but rather allow them to get away with treating the passengers in an ugly manner. The rest of the reps at that station were no better. Every single one of the customers at the desk (total of 8), walked away grouchy and angry and I cannot blame them.

After making that line I was redirected to a second one that took no less than 20 minutes. So, by the time I actually got to speak to someone, that flight was no longer an option. I asked her if she could send me on another airline (I know they can do that when they screw up) and she said no because it was due to weather. As if it was due to weather where I was at or as if them being so slow and having such long lines was also a weather issue. I am now on standby for a flight at 2pm which she told me I probably won't be able to get on because it's fully booked and there's nothing else available until tomorrow. Nice one United!";NEGATIVE

In 5 days a flight was cancelled, our bags got lost, other flight was late, making me lose a connection flight and making me stay one night in the connection city. They didn't even want to give us a hotel voucher because it ""was not their fault"". Most of the company workers treat customers horribly with bad manners and being rude, with some rare exceptions. The workers are never there to help you. When you ask for their help for ticketing or luggage issues they simply say: ""There is nothing we can do"". United Airlines managed to mess up me and my family's vacation in a few days. So my recommendation: Never fly with this horrible airline. Oh, and a small detail: mine and my whole family's tickets were for Business Class, and you still receive that poor kind of treatment. And when they change our flights, they put us on economy class. Such a joke.";NEGATIVE

Two years ago I flew them and they delayed and cancelled my flight, after 7 hours of promising we'd get off the ground.  United Airlines string you along in the hopes that no one asks for a refund. No regard for their customers, they should just be honest so that people can make arrangements early. Flew them again (no other flights ) last week, and low and behold, the same thing happened again. Fool me once I guess. On top of that, their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive. Terrible airline, avoid at all costs.";NEGATIVE

This airline doesn't allow you to take a carry on larger than a backpack, so I had to check my small suitcase that any other airline would consider a carry on. My flight that was supposed to leave at 1:00pm was delayed 11 times and cancelled once. When I was finally able to fly out it was 10 pm. When I arrived in Washington I was told that they had left my luggage back in Cleveland and it would not arrive until 11 am the next morning. This was a problem because I had a meeting at 10 am the next morning. United said they would update me about my luggage, but they never did. I called at 11, when my luggage was supposed to arrive and they told me they would deliver it to my hotel in 6-7 hours. Needless to say I drove back to the airport to pick the luggage up myself. The entire trip I encountered rude and incompetent staff who seemed unwilling to perform the job they had been hired to do. I will never fly United again.";NEGATIVE

My flight (#1936) from Chicago to Hartford was supposed to depart at 9:17 on July 17th, 2017, and arrive in Hartford at 12:30 am on the 18th. Before arriving at O'Hare, many passengers had received multiple texts/emails stating the flight was to be delayed with significant fluctuations in the delay time with each message. After everyone had waited at the gate for 2+ hours, we were told that the flight was to be cancelled because there was simply ""no crew."" The manager thought it was a proper compensation to just give $10 meal vouchers to the passengers and then told us to all get in a line for customer service. Almost all the passengers, including myself, waited in line for over an hour, being told that perhaps we could get a hotel room courtesy of United until the next flight out that wasn't already overbooked, which made many for around 9:20 PM almost 24 hours later than the original flight. As we were standing in line, an employee gave us papers telling us to call a customer service number that might be able to help us out, which had the majority of us on hold for 15+ minutes. When I was finally able to speak to a representative, the conversation was unhelpful as there was seemingly nothing that could be done. As the end of the line reached the desk, we were told that the hotels that United could offer rooms in were booked up and that they couldn't offer us that either. I managed to get on a flight out at 6 AM on the 17th as part of a standby with a few other passengers- out of the fully booked flight that needed to be in Hartford 6 hours prior.

united-airlines;2017-07-13;" |  First and foremost this was my worst flying experience ever! We started are day by being at the airport at 7.30am. in Harrisburg, PA. We boarded plane (American Eagle) and were pulled out on tarmac and we had to stop due to no flights in or out of Philly. Weather cleared, we pulled out and the crew had to abandon flight due to mechanical issues. That brought us to our only option of flying United Airlines to IAD at 2.25 in the afternoon to get to a larger airport with more options. We had to wait for an incoming flight from IAD which was delayed due to a foul smell but we finally left after 4.00. Before leaving Harrisburg we had to change our connecting flight to MSP thinking there is no way we will make it. As it turned out we did make the flight, just barely. The plane was loaded and the door shut and we were ready to pull out. The entire flight had to get off and re check in because of a computer error. We were reloaded and then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours, flight crew not helpful, we were finally told we had to go back to gate for more gas which was a lie. In reality the flight crew timed out. No other crew available. The United help desk was so not helpful and horribly slow to re-book passengers. After nearly half an hour to 45 minutes we were able to finally get re-booked on flight to Chicago and then we would have to stay overnight and fly to MSP in the morning. At this point it was after 9 at night. We flew to Chicago (O'Hare) and luckily the flight scheduled for MSP was delayed two hours so we were able to make it home at 2.30 in the morning. I have to say the only good thing about the whole day was the flight crew on that last flight. Thanks to them my 13 year old son was able to make it to his soccer tournament.";NEGATIVE

The first time they delayed it, we were going to miss our connecting flight so we had to change our flight from Chicago to Anchorage. After getting off the phone the first time, I check my new itnerary and it didn't have my husband and I sitting together after I had told the lady we had a lap child. I called back to explain this again and she said for us to sit together I would have to pay to be upgraded. Meanwhile the flight out of FWA was delayed even further due to a part not coming in, and so I had to find an alternate route. She couldn't find me anything out of FWA that day, so we ended up having to drive to Chicago. Only then, when I told her we were driving did she upgrade our seats for us to sit together. On the way back, we cancelled the flight back from Chicago or Fort Wayne as our car was parked in Chicago. The desk in Anchorage said our last leg to FWA was never cancelled so our luggage was going to be sent there, I asked her to cancel our last leg and the lady at the desk told me I had to call to cancel it myself, and that they couldn't print off a baggage tag to have our luggage end up in Chicago. After being on the phone for 20 mins and the lady on the phone not understanding anything (as they never did every time I called, which was 5+ times) they were calling all United flights to Chicago to check in. So I finally gave up and had our luggage sent to Fort Wayne. I wouldn't recommend flying on this airline if you have a conncecting flight. I wouldn't recommned flying this airline if you have children. The fact that their plane was screwed up due to maintenance and the unhelpfulness of the staff to try and help us get to our destination was absolutely ridiculous.  When she couldn't get us out of Fort Wayne on June 28th, the lady on the phone said she could reschedule us for July 30th! I had also gotten up to change my son's diaper in the lavatory. There was a drink cart blocking the lavatory in the front due to the pilots using the bathroom / getting coffee at the front lavatory and the pilot told me I had to use the back lavatory. So I walked back and the flight attendants were about 5 rows from the back with the drink cart, then the flight attendants said I had to wait until the pilots were done to use the front one. I asked if they could push the drink cart back for me to get through and I would wait to go to my seat until they were finished. She said I needed to wait to use the front one, I just couldn't wait up by cockpit. So I held my son for about 10 mins in the aisle before the pilots were done getting coffee to change my son's dirty diaper in the front lavatory.";NEGATIVE

On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins. United Airlines is a prime example of corporations that wrongly put profit before customer experience. In my next time flying, I will surely stay away from United Airlines.";NEGATIVE

However, after an hour and a half, the crew didn't want to wait any more and went home. At that point, my 9:17pm flight got bumped to 8:30 am.

Let me add how rude every employee I met for them was! Absolutely no help or care in the world. Then we get to the gate and I see almost everyone bringing on both.

Not only that, we were met with many additional costs that are new to us. I have flown many international flights and have always been given a meal. On this flight however, we were given a bag of pretzels and would be charged extra for snacks or a meal. I have also never been charged extra for a checked bag on an international flight.

The woman checking in pets was so slow that all of the pets ahead of us and ours got on the flights on time, we all got to the airport late. All missed our flights. A few minutes late to load luggage ruined the whole trip. Luggage has to be with passengers, pets do not? Put on another flight with 2 airlines, 2 airports, pets had to be boarded, needed a hotel, etc. until the next day. The price difference with the next booking was over $600.00 with no price adjustment. There is never enough help at the counters, people miss flights because of lack of employees. Pets are put in overnight boarding, an extra expense and extra stress on them. Money spent on hotel and food because you need to stay your first night on the island to pick up pets the next morning.

Why? 8 hours in the sky with no free hot meals (you have to purchase from a menu and it's not cheap - $10 for a burger), no in-flight entertainment screens, and a sardine can economy cabin with the 3-4-3 seating arrangement. All this in mind and I was not eager to fly. As I boarded the plane and settled in my seat I noticed that yes the seats got narrower to accommodate more seats across but the seats are also new and well crafted with details. The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi. (Make sure you have downloaded the United app before you board). The wifi connectivity was fairly strong though it didn't work the last half of the flight. Cabin crew were pleasant. They had poise, well groomed and very polite and I have no complaints or problems with them. The only huge disappointment I have is that for an 8-hour flight, no free meals were offered! It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10. If it was that expensive then it should taste good I thought - which did. $10 Mediterranean chicken wrap was a rather small portion for a $10 meal but the tastes were worthy enough for you to think it came from Chipotle or something.";POSITIVE

The other flights had Direct TV screens which required credit card swipes.  The 5.5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco only offered one beverage service and no food cart.

My wife and I despite having the same booking number could not be seated together but this may have been due to changing our flight the week before. This also meant a downgrade to economy but on this short flight from San Francisco to San Diego doesn't make much difference as there is little on offer in either class.

I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn't sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn't miss my name being called but the screen still said ""Boarding"" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by's she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements. I am a college student who cannot afford to pay to spend a night in a hotel so this left me in a terrible situation. I have flown United my whole life and I have never been so disappointed with them as I am today.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-24;" |  This was the best economy class flight I have had on United in a while. Flew San Francisco to Washington. The service was great, all attendants offered excellent personalized service - eye contact, smiles, all the right stuff. Beverages were offered at least four times during the 4 hour flight with snacks being offered twice. It was a real pleasure. We took off on time and landed about 30 minutes early. Even boarding, with an outsized Group 1, was fast and efficient. A very positive experience overall.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-24;" |  Tokyo Narita to Houston. I've previously taken this route four years ago and I was expecting the same. Well, that wasn't the case. For a trans-pacific flight, the flight crew was not approachable or polite in any matter besides maybe two who did an excellent job. There was one who was very sarcastic and rude to a passenger and another who was not knowledgeable of the food she was serving. The food portions were rather small compared to a domestic trans-con flight. For dinner, they served chicken rice or pasta with a roll and a cup of salad, and vanilla ice cream.  In the middle of the flight, they served snacks. Ice-cold ham & cheese sandwich with Asian-style trail mix and a chocolate. The sandwich was terrible. I gave praise to the crew walking around the cabin giving away water in between meal times. Then before landing, breakfast. Cheese omelet with a ""rubber"" sausage and hashbrowns or this Japanese chicken rice with this bourbon cookie. The crew was not very presentable and mediocre, some of the crew looked like they just lazily put on their uniform without a care of how they looked. There were only two crew who had a smile on their face the whole flight. Some had the expression of regret for choosing their career as a flight attendant, some were just tired and wanted to go back to the crew rest, and some had great poise. The seat was rather decent for a 12-hour flight. Great legroom and recline degree and the cushioning are comfortable for sleep - there were even pillows and blankets. There was also an IFE screen on each seat but none of them worked the entire flight. The crew tried their best to reboot and get it to work but it wouldn't budge. No movies or TV programs would work but games and the flight map did. It was a good thing there was in-flight wifi which you can connect to use the United app where you can enjoy free entertainment with latest movies and TV shows free of charge. Before I went on this flight I flew into Tokyo Narita from Manila and arrived at Tokyo on-time at 2:50 PM but this flight was due to depart at 4:30 PM. So once I arrived my boarding pass didn't have info on the gate number but there was a United representative giving info specifically about that. Approachable and polite. The overall flight experience was decent - close to mediocre due to inconsistent cabin crew and meager cabin product compared to ANA who fly the same route on a higher level of service. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-24;" |  Dallas to Omaha via Chicago. My colleague and I were traveling for business this morning and had to be in Omaha by 10:30 AM. Our initial flight from DFW was delayed due to weather and that was going to cause us to miss our flight from Chicago to Omaha. We ended up cancelling the whole trip since we would not be able to make our meeting. I get it, no one can control the weather and flights had to be delayed, I'm not upset about that. What I am upset about is their solution to this series of unfortunate events. We were immediately shut down at the airport by the United concierge lady and she said that these reservations were non-refundable and there was nothing she could do. She suggested that we call the 1-800 number and they may be able to help us further. Once I got back into the office I called the United Airlines 1-800 number. Once I was connected to a live representative she said that she would be able to credit those trips back to both of us for future use with United ($128.80 each), but we would have to pay a ""flight change"" fee of $200 EACH. She basically told me that we would each have to give United Airlines $200 before we could use the $128.80 credit that each of us have.  What I am taking away from this is that United Airlines does not care about it customers and the situations that they are put in. We had no intentions of cancelling these trips and only did so because we had no choice given the circumstances. They offered no help whatsoever and did not provide any sort of solution to the unfortunate situation that we were both in. My colleague and I wasted $257.00, and United Airlines said that we can still use that money with them if we give them an additional $400.00. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-23;" | For a domestic, US flight, United 1262 Newark to Denver was reasonably pleasant. The row 20, exit row window, provided more-than-ample leg room. The advertised food options were available and of quite good quality, and the service, despite the fact that the aircraft was completely filled, was very satisfactory. The AVOD screens in the seatback in front offered an excellent choice for in-flight entertainment. I don't know if this was intentional, but the screens were activated w/o charge. In addition, the personal device entertainment system worked well, and I was able to watch ""Lincoln"" while keeping the flight map on the AVOD screen. My experiences with United continue to be positive, and I hope that this positive experience will balance the plethora of negative reviews.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2017-06-21;" |  I booked a flight with United Airlines flying from PHL to JAX, with a connecting flight in Newark. First of all, I always fly American Airlines, but this time I decided to try out the cheaper option. This was a huge mistake. I signed up for flight updates twice, once when I bought the ticket, and once when I checked in for the flight ahead of time. I get to the airport and it turns out that they booked me on a train to Newark without making that clear. Luckily, I was early like I always am for my flights so I lugged my two suitcases to the train station to catch the train to Newark. After all this, I get to the counter in Newark and they tell me my flight was canceled. Mind you, I made sure my phone was on and charged all day to make sure I would be notified of any changes to the flight. The United employee told me the next flight out was for 7am the next day, but that they would not cover the cost of a hotel for the night, despite it being their error that put me in this position. I then ask if I can have them cover the cost for a train back to Philly, and they print the ticket out right there and hand it to me, and then they tell me if I want to get to Jacksonville (my original destination) that I would have to pay for a whole new ticket. When I make it clear that it's unacceptable for me to be forced to buy two full-priced tickets to the same destination, they tell me the ticket they handed me back to Philly was non-refundable. Then I ask if I can at least get on the 7am flight they mentioned before, but now they're telling me that it's completely booked, as well as the flight after that. The next flight I could be guaranteed a seat on is over a day from then, and again, they will not help with hotel costs. By now, I'm livid, and I talk to a supervisor and they take the ticket back, telling me they wouldn't be able to give me a refund on my ticket at all, despite it being their error that put got me stranded in Newark. After calling customer service I finally talk to someone who will give me a refund, but now I'm forced to buy a ticket for over a hundred more because it's last second, when I originally bought my ticket over a week ahead of time. They should have at least offered me the soonest flight from a competing airline, but they gave me nothing except a guarantee that I'll be paying hundreds more out of pocket for an absolutely terrible experience. I have been on several flights, both domestic and international, but United has by far been the worst experience I've had ever. Bad customer service, bad reliability, no notification system for flight changes, and little clarity in their system overall. I will gladly pay extra to fly with American Airlines (really any airline except United) from now on!";NEGATIVE

Had entertainment that we were required to pay for and very uncomfortable seating. Of course, we only had a cookie and one drink going to Maui. Return trip from Maui was over an hour late boarding, and we are sitting on the tarmac as I type because the gate is blocked with a broken plane. Going on 30 minutes so far. We had no entertainment since wifi was not operating and the free entertainment was thus not available. I won't even mention the stewardesses. Not into their job. JetBlue, Delta, Lufthansa (for Europe) here we come!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-20;" |  Flew Chicago O'Hare to Jacksonville, FL. Basic economy, what a scam. Means you have no options, no rights. You cannot select a seat, it will be assigned upon your arrival, good luck. You cannot check-in 24 hours in advance. You have to check-in at the airport and hope you get a seat. I booked a flight under Basic Economy fare for $585 (not cheap!) not fully understanding the restrictions. My bad, buyer beware. You will be the consumer that is ""bumped"" when they are over-sold, which is the case on every flight. I am a Premier member and a loyal United customer for over 25 years. The member who would always select United over American, Delta and other airlines. I called for help. Answer: Sorry nothing we can do, the system won't allow us to override it. But, if you pay a $200 change fee plus additional $35 fare difference, we can cancel the Basic Economy and issue a non-refundable ticket. Now, no longer a United Loyal customer. ";NEGATIVE

I decided to give it another try from Kona to Los Angeles and was really hoping for a good experience. It wasn't horrible but well below the standards of even Delta or Hawaiian.The aircraft is ancient and the only entertainment available is if you know in advance to download the United app. There is no advance notice of this, there is no WiFi at Kona airport anyway. If you haven't done this there is nothing. Unbelievably no one told the crew boarding had commenced and I walked into a dark cabin to find flight attendants sleeping in row 2. Embarrassing for all. Once they woke up the senior staff was actually fine with the minimum they are given to offer. Food was ok although oddly dessert consisted of a single piece of chocolate offered on the tray next to some crackers. No bread or salad was offered. This for a 5 hour flight in first class us a bit bizarre. The flight was on time, the crew was fairly pleasant, the seat minimally acceptable for 5 hours but really the experience was kind of bizarre due to all of the above.";NEGATIVE

Pilot did an excellent job of communicating with passengers as we encountered threat of developing severe weather and possible need to divert route on a late day/night flight to Cedar Rapids. He kept us updated as flight progressed and really appreciated his emphasis on safety, felt well informed as we saw flashes of lightening and huge thunderheads in the dark and dealt with turbulence for much of the flight. He was able to move alongside the line of storms while just keeping ahead of them. We no more than touched the wheels down in Cedar Rapids and the rain hit. The passengers erupted in appreciative cheers and clapping. grateful to be safely on the ground just before midnight and did not have to divert to Minneapolis. Thanks to an excellent pilot and crew.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-18;" | United Airlines hasn't improved. This flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles ought to be the worst I have ever taken. Not because of the lenght, nor because of aircraft, simply because of the rudeness of most flight attendant on board. I think United should review their interpersonal skills with some of their staff. Only 3 staff were polite, the rest were just plain awful. Flight attendants going down the aisle pushing people without excusing themselves - really! I understand they have to work but could they have been polite. Working with public isnt easy, so if you cant do it: find another job. I had never flown United before and for sure now, never will. Next time I will go Air New Zealand again: ""They"" know how. You might as well be stuck somewhere than flying United. It avoids aggravation.";NEGATIVE

They fly a massive Boeing 777 on this  Honolulu to Houston route and every single seat was sold. The boarding process was disorganized and unpleasant. Due to slight turbulence, the frowning flight crew weren't allowed to serve drinks until 2 hours into the flight. Once they got moving, they were constantly hitting into people and waking them up all night. There were no free meals, no AVOD, no smiles, and the flight crew were absolutely unapproachable and miserable. It's a shame that Americans are willing to tolerate such a disgraceful level of service from this carrier.";NEGATIVE

The new Boeing 737-924s have United's latest amenities, including entertainment and flight information delivered to your pad, smart phone or computer via internal wi-fi. The selection of entertainment options is quite good and free. You must bring your own earbuds or headphones, even in first. Wi-fi otherwise is pretty dreadful and not worth whatever you pay for it. The inflight dynamic map is completely useless. First class service is quite good and attentive, but the food is mediocre. Gone are the days when the flight attendants constructed an ice cream sundae for each first class passenger, replaced by mango sorbet in a cup. Meal selection is handled rather oddly, with first choice going to those with the highest frequent flier tier status. Thus, even if you pay full price for your first class ticket, you may come up at the bottom of the pile in choosing your meal. Not endearing.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-14;" |  I am actually a fairly happy frequent flier of United Airlines, but you (and they) need to know what inconsistencies and problems flyers experience. Here are just some of the many independent situations I've experienced in 6 months (2017), all with United Airlines. 2 x jetway failures – Upon arrival at gate, had to push plane out and had to wait on tarmac for another available gate. This made us 45 minutes and 35 minutes late these two examples. One of these examples, I missed my connecting flight. Had to sprint to connecting flight on the other. 2 x flight crew members didn't show up for work - one 1.5 hour delay and one flight cancelled (after several hours) and had to stay overnight in Houston. Was forced to pay for most of hotel room. Luckily I was first in line to get rebooked the next morning and was also able to get an airport hotel room. Others were not so lucky 2 x sensor failures - On two separate trips had to return to gate after pushing off, one time there was no immediate gate and had to wait on tarmac for over an hour. Another time, plane was taken off service and we waited for several hours for a replacement. 2 x late planes – Planes didn’t arrive on time (not weather-related) and once we took off and landed at connecting airport, I had to run from terminal to terminal to make connection. Most other passengers doing the same connection did not make it. On the positive side, I will say that my status does help me solve many other problems that come up (some weather-related, some not), but for non-status passengers, those other situations would have been horrific. Also, Economy Plus is really the only reason I can enjoy my experience as much as I do. I am treated well by United team members, and Economy Plus seat spacing is enjoyable even for a 6'3"" person.";POSITIVE

I just hope that I will arrive and return safe and sound. Not to mention this is my first time flying with them. It turns out that the flights were really pleasant. FA did good job on both flights even though not particularly charming if you used to fly with QR or SQ except for a male FA on United 999 who was exceptionally nice and polite. B767 looks very spacious with newest IFE, B777 shows its age but still in a good shape. The inbound flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we arrived just slightly behind the schedule. Both landings were probably among the smoothest I have experienced. The food was rather small in portion but with a decent quality. My pre-order meal (MOML) was well served something I really appreciated. The collection of movie might be limited if we compare to those of EK, QR, or SQ but I managed to watch two very good ones released in 2015 and 2016 respectively.

(This is the same bag and belongings I flew with on the way here and it was totally fine). They bag was packed a little too big and I said all I had to do was move my belonging a bit around because I had just gotten something out of it and that's why it wasn't fitting correctly.

Unfortunately, United fare's from San Jose to Washington via Chicago was the cheapest. I work for the City of San Jose and have to book the lowest fare. I figured the fare was the lowest because of United's recent issues and as a result I would get at least okay service. This has not been the case. I've now learned that United has now created a new class called Basic Economy, which apparently does not work with self check-in. I did not realize that this fare meant, not only would I have to check my bag but would have to pay $25 or $50 if I took it to the gate. My seats get assigned at the gate by rude agents. As required by this fare I was the last to board and saw many open seats. I got all the way to the last window seat I was told with a huff that taking one of the many open seats farther forward would be a $119 upgrade.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-06-10;" |  Due to United Airlines incomparable incompetence my arrival was inexcusably delayed almost 12 hours. For a company who's customer service is already hanging by a very thin thread you would think that they would be doing everything to make your flights as smooth and pleasant as possible. And yet, on this day at the end of a very long journey, I find myself inflicted upon by their abysmal brand of service especially in regards to scheduling, and accountability. United Airlines first moved my first international flight up, only to delay it when I got to the gate back to its original time. I faced frustration and boredom being trapped in San Francisco airport facing not one, not two, but what became seven delays? Delays that have been caused by runway maintenance. A almost four hour delay that could have been easily avoided if you just had things together and scheduled your planes around the affected runways. Let's not forget the additional delay caused when the flight crew simply couldn't be found to come to the gate so we could start getting underway! After the above delays myself and my fellow passengers were finally able to board our flight - only to be told by the captain that there would be another brief delay while we waited for another crew member because one of the pilots was near the end of their union hours. We sit on the plane stuck for another 20 minuets or so, only to be told they can't find anyone, and can we please get off the plane because our whole flight is cancelled. A whole flight full of people kicked off of a plane, the majority of them with no other flights to their destinations. There were other flights, my bag for instance was on one of them. I know this because it's now 11.37 at night and the airport is very full, as were the lines to the customer service kiosks. Speaking of the customer service, the kiosk I get to is uncrowded but understaffed and run by clearly undertrained employees. The ones I'm dealing with keep having to ask each other for help, and give advice/plans that contradict one another. (All of this happens while the loudspeakers ask for a last call to a last flight to Dallas - the city I'm trying to get to) one of them even takes what seems to be a personal call while 'assisting' me (could have been work, but there was a lot of giggling). When I finally get hold of a supervisor I have to plead to get the next flight out of this godforsaken place, which I am reluctantly given as its with one of your competitors. Almost 12 hours later I do finally make it home - thanks to American Airlines. ";NEGATIVE

And as usual the staff is rather older and more experienced (seniority principle on this routing) then on any other route on the planet. But the always friendy, smiling and efficient crew did more then compensate for old seats or plane. One staff did the cooking and the other one did the service. All in a very personal and efficient way, one felt like being already in Honolulu. The food and the drinks on offer were good and well sized.

You pay a ridiculous price for a service expecting to get where you request at the time you request it. Totalling upwards of 3 hours of delays, a food shortage on the plane, overhead bins clearly designated for passengers instead crammed with United employee paraphernalia, they've clearly taken away what precious seat space was left as you will be knees to the seat in front of you. Wifi isnt free as they advertise, no it is only free to view their partnering sales advertisements. Don't bother making plans for transportation upon arrival as you aren't promised you'll arrive on time. So much of our time wasted. Planned on using the metro train systems upon arrival but that can't happen as our flight will arrive hours after close of major public transportation. So we will incur further unexpected costs in transportation, to make up for the mess United Airlines has left it's passengers in, with No regard to the inconvenience or disregard for their customers time.

Came to find out that 10 people from our flight lost luggage. Several conflicting explanations were offered but after an hour we all left without our luggage. On our return flight was told after boarding that the only way to watch anything was by streaming thru our own devices and that we must download the United app. Of course that wasn't possible for the large number of attempts to access internet and App Store. Probably wouldn't complain but then we were delayed after we were seated. It was explained that they had no pilot or flight crew. Would drive to get us a flight crew and pilot ASAP. An hour after boarding we were told that the pilot Was at the airport and would begin preparing to leave. Still attempting to access App Store. I will never use United Airlines again!! By the time we back away from the gate we have already been seated for an hour and 20 + min. Most unprofessional travel experience.;NEGATIVE

We got a free upgrade to premium eco so me and my travel companion could sit together - which are standard seats with standard service and extra legroom - which was a decent move. Customer service is friendly and helpful, however the crew was a little rude. The Boeing 767 was old but not worn down, the IFE was aged as well. Cannot complain about the food (chicken or Pasta), but both flights were delayed at least one hour, HAM-EWR even 2,5 hours. Thus, United is a typical US carrier: nothing exciting, but solid.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2017-06-05;" | I am officially done with United Airlines and do not plan to use their service ever again. They are on the same poor quality list as Spirit Airlines now. Yesterday I checked in early for my flight from Newark to Raleigh/Durham via the United Airlines app and received a pop up message. The message stated one personal bag was allowed and a full size carry was not allowed. I was instructed to check in my full size carry on for the price of $25. When I attempted to bypass this message another message popped up stating if a full size carry on arrived at the gate I would be charged $25 to check the bag in and an additional $25 would also be added as a service fee for last minute baggage check. I went on the United's website where I saw carry on bags were allowed on the plane. Nevertheless I didn't want any problems so I checked in my carry on for a price of $25 when I arrived to the airport. At that point I asked a floor customer service representative about the notification I received regarding the full size carry on. I was informed that I was not allowed to bring a full size carry on because I purchased a ticket at a reduced rate on priceline.com. If I purchased my ticket through United at regular price I could bring my carry on onto the plane complementary. I could not believe it. To make matters worse when I arrived at the gate and they began to call passengers by group number, the representative clearly stated in her announcement passengers boarding with group numbers 1-4 may bring on a carry on luggage. I of course was in group 5, therefore I was disqualified. Although I saved money purchasing a ticket via priceline.com, in the end United made that money back by forcing me pay for my carry on bag. That is a clear Spirit Airlines move. You can get a cheap flight but you have to pay for other things. I see United still haven't learned how to treat their customers.";NEGATIVE

Bun/sandwich served for snack was dry and hardly edible. There was absolutely no value for additional money I paid for Economy premium seat.

Food was offered on our flight, I got a chicken wrap and it was larger than I expected and tasty.

My only complaint is when did it become ok to ""Dip"" tobacco and spit in a bottle ? The guys next to me enjoyed dipping the whole flight, getting fresh dip several times. The smell (minty like malox) gave me a headache but that fact he was allowed to spit in a bottle while I was eating was just gross.

united-airlines;2017-05-31;" | Extremely disappointed with the treatment of a first-class passenger. We purposely booked our 16 year old daughter in first class so she could feel safe with the attention of the airline staff since she was traveling a long way by herself (Denver to Boston). She was booked in row 3A, and upon arriving at the gate, was called to the counter. The gate agent said, ""We are trying to find a seat for you"". No explanation. She called me upset because she did not know what was going on. I told her to go back to the counter and show them her itinerary and confirmation. She did, and the same agent responded with, ""There is a broken seat in first class. We are trying to find a seat for you"". Again, no confirmation that she will get eventually get a seat on the flight. My daughter looks at the available seats being displayed on the monitor and notices middle seats available from row 10 and up. Thirty minutes goes by with no communication. Then my husband asks to speak to the agent via my daughter's cell phone, and the exchange was so heated, the agent slammed the phone down on the counter. My daughter picked up her phone and walked away from the counter without either gate agent saying a word to her. Simple, clear communication showing they care would have gone a long way instead of leaving a 16 year old in tears. I ended up calling United and the agent switched me to a manager right away. The manager said she was being assigned seat 21A window seat (even thought the gate agents at that point still hadn't said anything to her). or the reservation manager could switch her to a first class seat on the 12:30pm flight instead of her 9:50am flight. My daughter preferred to wait until the 12:30pm flight just to avoid the gate agents. A simple, caring, clear communication from the gate agents would have avoided a lot of anxiety, anger, and tears. I know she would have easily taken row 21A if she wasn't so upset, but now she never wants to fly United again, and I don't blame her. We'll all do our best never to take United again.";NEGATIVE

Yes I was asking for a ""favor"", for my own convenience but i figured if there was room, why wouldn't an airline take care of its customers? After talking to customer service, they confirmed the flight to have many empty seats. Unfortunately unless I was premium status, there was a standby fee of $75 per one way flight. Wouldn't it be easier to keep customers happy whenever possible? Beyond customer service, this is bad business practices. The airline business is time critical. once a flight leaves, an airline can't make any more money from that flight for ticket sales. By moving up passengers to earlier flights, an airline can reserve the future potential to sell more seats on later flights. Why would an airline limit future growth potentinal? Especially when at the expense of the customer experience. My complaint is small compared to many news worthy stories, but just another example of continued poor customer service from United.";NEGATIVE

While checking in bags for a flight from KOA to PDX the credit machines /kiosks went down and though the ticket agent asked us to try several times (3 to be exact) we were not able to pay on the kiosk with a credit card. We waited patiently with the attendants and a growing line of passengers behind us for over a half hour. After the agent confirmed there was an issue with ""the lines for the machine"" and we were told ""it was being worked on"" the attendant said she would check our bags for FREE. She checked us in for our flight printed our bag tags and boarding passes and we went on our way, boarded, and flew home. Today there are three separate charges for $75 each on my bank card, for a transaction I was assured was free! Unacceptable. I was extremely patient and understand that tech issues happen but there is no excuse for poor customer service from the 800 number provided by the charging agent. When calling the phone number next to the 3 transactions on my bank account for customer service I was told that they can't help me! Why have customer service agents that cannot fix problems. I am currently waiting on the phone and have been waiting for an hour and five minutes for a resolution to this problem and will certainly be filing a formal complaint. To top it all off, during my call with customer service the supervisor that I spoke with tried to blame the ticket agent! All of the agents at the airport, physically checking passengers in did a great job under the conditions. With every kiosk down they managed to help all of the passengers checking in for their flights while dealing with technical issues. I'm certain there are several other passengers that have experienced the same problem! I stood at the counter and waited while the gate agent called for assistance and was told it was a system wide problem or slow age. She did a fantastic job and provided excellent customer service and I wish I remembered her name so she could be recognized for been extremely helpful while trying to check in my family of five, included three children, for a flight home.

However, my 14 hour economy flight was probably about as enjoyable as any economy flight can be. United flies the lovely new 787 on this route, the air quality is better, the lighting is better and the seats, although they look really small, are actually amongst the most comfortable I have flown on. Video Entertainment is great, although the lack of audio was a bit frustrating, take your phone or Ipad along for this. Wi-Fi for purchase is a fun option to pass the time and costs are reasonable. The food was OK, a meal on departure, a snack in between and then a rubbery egg breakfast before landing in LA. The reality is this was an economy flight, the fare was really really good value. We resisted the constant sales push before the flight to purchase economy plus which does provide extra leg room if you feel you need it, at least with United have this option at a pretty reasonable rate if you feel you need it. By the way, this flight was spot on time as were all of our other United internal flights, boarding and disembarking was smooth as anything. The crew were friendly enough and seemed pretty happy about servicing our requirements, they appeared older than on most other airlines but were chatty and responsive.";POSITIVE

This flight was advertised on the UA website and even on the boarding pass as new United Polaris Business Class, with ""Redesigned seating, luxury bedding and calming amenities offer the ultimate comfort for relaxation and sleep"". My expectations were quite high. You cannot believe my disappointment and disgust when I boarded the plane and found out the business class cabin was most outdated and terrible business class I have ever seen. The seats were incredible old, tired and dirty. There was no access to the isle for every seat. There were scratches, dents and dints everywhere in the cabin. The crew was working in the galleys without any curtain to the cabin. So we had the full galley light in the cabin at all time. Toilets were outdated. They were clean but the bins very completely full soon and have not been emptied during the flight. There was no mouth wash, hand cream, toothpaste, combs or anything similar which is standard for all other decent airlines. The food was kind of okay. the wines were actually excellent.  The UA lounge at Dulles airport was the usual UA standard (slightly disappointing). At 9 pm there was plenty of seating available which was nice.

Turkish Airlines was able to ensure my bags made it from Rome to Istanbul to Chicago all in one piece despite multiple delays and a very long layover. United lost my bag in the 1 hours flight from Chicago to Kansas City. At the baggage claim the gentlemen said it was still in Chicago and would be delivered the next day. It was not.  Unfortunately, they were still unable to recover my luggage as of 3 days after landing, forcing me essentially try to make excuses for not having the promised items at the meeting with my clients. I filed additional claims for my luggage twice, neither of which were even responded to. 4 days later, I called again, and was told my luggage was simply lost. I unchecked rechecked the bag in Chicago after arriving from an international flight, and they somehow lost the bag. Trying to get United to cover the costs of what was lost is proving to be even more nightmarish. The quality of service is astounding awful. I have had delayed bags before with United, but now having them simply lose my bag on such a short flight, and then fight me at every step when trying to claim the bag is shockingly despicable. If I would have known my Turkish Airlines flight was using United for the last leg, I would have never bought the ticket, as United is generally a terrible airline anyways for constant delays, uncomfortable seats, and delaying my baggage constantly. But this has trumped all other experiences regarding terrible care and costing me literal thousands of dollars for their negligence.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2017-05-17;" |  Lisbon to Newark. The new Polaris Business class of United is a very nice product. The seats are comfortable, the screen is a nice size and the new amenities kit is excellent. The seats are lie flat and offer a great rest. However, they are somewhat difficult to adjust at the intermediate levels, the upright and lie flat are done at the push of a button. Other than that, the only complaint I had was for the lack of storage on the seat - the old seats (and this may have been the ones in first) and small nooks to store stuff. That is not the case here, or at least I did not find them - so the storage has to be done in the overhead bins. Besides the very comfortable oversized pillow, United also provides you with two blankets, a regular one, and a slightly heavier quilted one. I initially used the quilted one, but since the temperature in the cabin was quite comfortable I eventually gave up on both. The food is a little lacking, for the first course, I chose the Halibut which was very good but second meal was a very dry and flavorless piece of chicken breast. This, in my opinion, is a problem, primarily because it is served an hour before landing and sticks in people's memories as their meal experience. The service while professional is not on par with European, Asian or Middle Eastern carriers. While I cannot put my finger on it simply lacks the elegance and savoir-faire of their counterparts. Another big issue is the entertainment, while there is an excellent selection I cannot for the life of me understand why I constantly have to be subjected to Barracuda and Marriott advertising - it is not just once, but after every single show that I want to watch. This really cheapens the United brand, if you want to do it on the domestic legs to offset the entertainment costs the so be it - but to do it on the international leg in business class is unheard of. United is definitely on to something with Polaris, with a little fine tuning this could become a Business Class for others to follow.";POSITIVE

I explained that my bag was located the night before and should of already been delivered to me. They then told me I could go ahead and spend $150 to replace the items in my bag while they got this sorted out. I thought, well at least they are trying to do right by me. This game went on for 4 days! My bag was finally delivered after I returned home from my vacation and after several angry phone calls. They kept getting my delivery address wrong, my bag color wrong and managed to ship my bag to several different airports before it finally made its way home. Once my bag arrived, I called United to get the $150 refund that they promised me plus some compensation given all the hassle. They actually told me, ""sorry, looks like whoever told you that failed to make a note in the system so we cannot offer you a refund now.""

Everyone stayed in the line waiting patiently to get helped. There were approximately 5 or 6 people in front of me. The supervisor was standing behind the counter and says they are going to be going down to one agent shortly and we could go to B terminal if we wanted. We all decided to wait where we were since we did not know how long the line was in B terminal. Then all of the sudden he says that this counter in F terminal was closed. He never pulled the strap and closed the line. We all said to him that he had told us they were going to one agent and we were all willing to wait. Why are you now changing and closing the counter wile there are people waiting to get helped. He made his staff leave immediately. I walked to B terminal next to him and asked him for his name. He said I'm not giving you my name. He told me that he had worked 18 hours and can't work anymore or he gets penalized. When we all arrive at the customer service counter at B terminal it was exactly what we were all trying to avoid when in B terminal, Long lines! He then proceeded to go behind the counter in B terminal and continue to work along with one of the customer service ladies that was at F terminal. He had told me when walking to B terminal that the staff that had been at F terminal had would too many hours and could not work more. That was clearly not the case since they started helping people in the line at B terminal. We could have all been helped where we were and much faster than having to get in a longer line.

I have a very limited budget and cannot afford the luxuries an upgrade has to offer. I can't help that I'm so tall, I don't feel like I should have to pay extra just to sit in a seat that won't leave my body hurting for days after. I've never had this issue on any other airline, even on newer planes of similar models. I'm not sure if this is a manufacturing defect, or they purposely made the rows so close together that I had to have my knees jammed into the seat in front of me (more so than usual), or the seats so tiny I could barely move or even buckle my seat belt. I am not an overweight person, I've never been this confined on a flight in my life, and I travel pretty frequently.

After sitting at the Albany gate for 20 minutes, the pilot informed us that the grounds crew forgot to load our bags! It’s not like we were the first flight. There was a United flight leaving at the gate over 30 minutes before us. My fiancé and I ended up running to our next gate because what was a 40-minute layover turned into a 15-minute layover in a different terminal. After sprinting up and down to the gate at Chicago, we arrived in the knick-of-time. We were able to grab salads at a stand outside the gate. After boarding the plane, we decided to eat our salads. Oddly we are able to finish our entire salad without moving. After sitting for 30 minutes, the pilot informed us there is an abnormal number of children on the plane therefore we were waiting for children life jackets. An hour goes by and we are informed from the pilot’s calculations we will need additional fuel, so we waited on the fuel truck. At this point all the young children who needed life jackets, are highly uncomfortable because the plane is becoming warm - over 80 degrees. It was an older plane so they could not turn on the AC. Think about all the poor parents! Scheduling is important to everyone’s well-being and we are now an hour and half late. If you can believe it, we were then informed the fuel truck put too much fuel in the plane! We are now waiting for another truck to take out some of the fuel. After sitting at the gate for an hour and 45 minutes, we were informed we will be leaving as soon as the second truck comes by because the first one broke down! We only sat at the gate on a stifling hot plane for two hours on what is normally a two and half hour plane ride.

After we got the luggage we had to take a bus to the terminal, when I got to the terminal I knew we were cutting it close so myself and 2 other passengers ran to the gate where we were supposed to catch our flight to Honolulu. We ran up to the terminal and the agent said ( with great satisfaction) that we were too late, even though it was 10 minutes before our flight was supposed to leave. Why United scheduled our flights with no time to get to our connecting flights does not make any sense. Our flight was on time to our connecting flight but we had to take a shuttle and the gates were pretty far apart, we landed at 7:10 and our connecting flight boarded at 7:10! There was no possible way to make that flight. They put me on another flight but tried to give me economy class instead of the first class I paid for. I called the 800 number and they were absolutely no help, the agents in the airport rescheduled me on a different first class flight. The flight to LA the plane was nice, the food was great and the stewardess was awesome but from LA to Hawaii the first class plane was lousy, no tv's in the headrests and not much more leg room then economy class. Because of their mistake I've lost a day of my vacation and probably gained a few gray hairs. Bottom line, stay way from United, they don't have a clue.";NEGATIVE

I am a single mom and this trip was a long time coming. It took me a long time to save up to pay for this flight (for all 8 of us) and to pay for a place for us to stay. We get on the plane to Newark from Pittsburgh and we had to wait 30 mins because they didn't fuel the plane. Now maybe it's my ignorance but shouldn't that be done before the passengers get on the plane? Why have people waiting after all the crazy things you have to do to get through security check with 8 people. While we were on that plane they delayed our flight to San Juan from Newark four hrs. Now if I was by myself I wouldn't be complaining but with a family of 8 this was no walk in the park. But once again maybe it's my ignorance but the flight was delayed because they didn't have a working plane. This to me is just unacceptable. This is all without any other compensation other than meal vouchers. Partly my fault because I was to naive to think I needed insurance for such a trip. Silly me! After five hrs of idle sitting my children couldn't careless about eating. But that's not the end of this great vacation that turned into a complete nightmare. Our flight was delayed yet again. And we are still waiting! I'm so disappointed. Thank you United Airlines.";NEGATIVE

Flight 1718 was delayed by air traffic control for an hour, which meant an extremely tight, in fact, impossible layover in Houston [7 minutes]. The gate agent [Gate B7 at SLC] got me a reservation on the first flight out the following day as the flight from Houston to New Orleans was the last of the day. The agents kept us up to date and were optimistic that time would be made up and the outbound flight held a few minutes to accommodate enroute passengers. Apparently, meals for first class were not delivered on the previous flight and the gate agent ran down to buy 8 meals to make sure we got fed. The United staff did an excellent job in hurrying boarding and making sure those with tight connections had a good shot at making the next flight. It all worked out! I made the flight to New Orleans. Not surprisingly, the checked bag didn't make it, but it was delivered to my door two days later, at an address 120 miles from New Orleans.

Our itinerary was cancelled without any notification for missing a flight in the itinerary. This resulted in a chaos for our travel plans and we had to spend over 2 hours on the phone with customer services. After speaking to various supervisors our flight was reinstated, but all our meal selections and seat selections disappeared. Our family had to sit in different spots and with my daughter who turned 13 mid-flight could not be seated with her whole family together. Our food selection was also not available and as a result our family had to survive without much food. What a pretty special way to celebrate a 13th birthday. As a dad I was quite ashamed to fly my family on United Airlines! Also United planes do not have privacy filters on the TV screens and all the screens are visible from everywhere. With the person sitting next to our daughter watching ""R"" rated content it was also very disturbing. All they need on your screens is a filter and only the person sitting on front of it can see the information on their display while people on either side only see a darkened screen.";NEGATIVE

It's extremely disappointing that I have been forced to check my bag time and again in while boarding, even when there is space in yet cabin. It is ridiculous! How can the cabin crew not communicate accurately to the people at the gate? I travel on business and so that I can move fast I travel light carrying only a cabin bag so I can zip to my destination as soon as I deboard as opposed to waiting at the carousel. This defeats the purpose. It's absolutely frustrating. And on top of that the lady at the gate was not courteous either: United certainly seems to be excelling at their growing reputation of pathetic customer service and it keeps getting worse.

It cost me a fortune. I was bumped to the cheapest flight, foreign airlines, worst seat. They lost my baggage, could not upgrade. No understanding at all, everybody was so rude. It is impossible to fly with United, fee for everything, penalty for any change completely disgusting. The only reason we keep flying with them is because they have a monopoly on the Houston market.

Shabby plane with very uncomfortable seats, tortoise like speed of service (why can Southwest serve drinks twice as fast?) and then the inevitable delays. Having been on 3 or 4 domestic flights this trip it seems at least part of United's problem is the endemic lack of capacity at key US airports like LGA. Every time delays taking off, delays finding a gate on arrival. All very frustrating. I thought the UK was bad at infrastructure with LHR running at 99.9% capacity but at least there are only delays there when there's a specific problem. At US airports it seems routine. All pretty unbelievable really - I ended up pining for the ruthless efficiency of easyJet and Ryanair back home which I never thought possible.";NEGATIVE

Then after my flights gets into Houston at 3 and I run through the entire airport, which is not small, and took a train. Go through customs, immigration, re-checking bags and all that. I finally see the gate at 3:42 and me and 2 other women watch them close the gate and tell us they gave our seats away. Even though we have 10 mins till departure.

However, when I went to check-in tonight I discovered that this was not done. After an hour on hold, I spoke to a supervisor who told me that this couldn't be accomplished and that my wife would have to pay a fee for her first bag! The supervisor told me there was no way she could waive this fee. This seems like a bait and switch operation for both United and Chase VISA. A poor way to treat a frequent flyer and high dollar user of the United branded VISA card. One more example of why many people, now including me will try to avoid United.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2017-04-21;" | This United flight was the return part of a same-day trip Washington to Tampa return. Both flights were boarded with good discipline, pushed-back early, and arrived ahead of schedule. The service in economy was minimal, but there was a normal beverage offering: soft drinks for free and alcoholic beverages for a reasonable charge. I reserved and received the exit row window seat, which is my favorite. The personal device service onboard is a step forward, but the flight map included is much inferior to the one Lufthansa offers. As a Star Alliance Gold, I took the hike over to the B concourse to enjoy the Lufthansa Senator Lounge, which was surprisingly uncrowded. These last few weeks have been a trial-by-fire for United Airlines. Many frequent flyers have been outraged by egregious onboard errors, but my experiences with United have always been positive. I have several trips with them planned for next month, and I hope and expect that these flights will go smoothly as well.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2017-04-20;" |  I fly to Ireland twice a year now and use either United or American. This is the first time I flew in a 767. I was most interested in the new United Polaris Business class. It may be different on the larger planes, however, on this aircraft the cabin was no different and was not new. The food from the new ""chef"" was the worst I've ever had in business class on any airline out of the 4 or 5 airlines I've traveled on in Business class. Having read the glorious PR about their new ""chef,"" I was really looking forward to the food. I wouldn't serve it in Economy and they ran out of the Chicken dish by the time they got to me. The fish (my reluctant second choice) was over cooked and dry. The green noodles were stuck together on the bottom where I assume they were overheated. On the flight from Palm Springs to Chicago, I was trapped in Economy since there was no business class on that plane. I sat in the 3rd row and the attendant announced they were out of the cheese plate and cheese burger to the row in front of me. I flew two days after the huge PR disaster, dragging a customer off the plane kicking and screaming. It seems that is not the only problem. This airline is not run well. When the poor attendant in Business class announced to me they were out of the chicken dish I ordered, I was a bit upset and she apologized and said it had been a rough couple of days. My other complaint is an ongoing problem that everyone I know is dealing with. They keep advertising their frequent flyer program but when you actually try to get a business class seat, it is impossible most of the time. As an exercise recently, I tried to get a seat for the rest of the year--8 months!--and there were two flights in those 8 months that I could get a business class seat flying from Palm Springs to Cork, Ireland, and of course that only applies to the long flight, not the two short flights on either end which must be economy. I tried last August to book Business class seats both ways on this current trip and there were no seats available on the return flight--though online it shows 27 available seats in Business class. I'll be using American from now on.";NEGATIVE

Since I spent 250,000 if my hard earned points to fly business on my first trip to Europe since 1986 I was anticipating a bit of a happier mood throughout the business cabin. Also, this was the vaunted new Polaris class which in my opinion was far from great. At 6'4"" I should have been able to stretch out flat, but because of the shape of the pods that could not happen. The seat was also very uncomfortable. This was some of the worst food I have ever been served on United. Thank goodness our flight back was on Air Canada which was a wonderful experience. Rest assured my new travel card will be Bank of America and where I not only earn more millage than with my current Chase card but also will not be stuck flying United again.";NEGATIVE

The outbound (BOS-ORD) plane, N57870, had no TVs. It was just overall a dirty and run-down plane. The return (ORD-BOS) plane, N75858, did have TVs. When I'm on a plane that has TVs, I usually watch a movie on my iPad and turn the TV to the map channel. It took almost 20 minutes for me to find the map, then while we were something like 15th in line for takeoff (because that's just how things happen at O'Hare), the screen told me that my ""free preview"" of DirecTV was up and I had to pay to continue using the TV for anything, including the map. Shortly after takeoff, I opened the movie on my iPad and saw that I had forgotten to rent the movie I wanted to watch (and I admit that this was on me). I decided to watch a movie on the seatback TV and just pay the fee. However, they didn't seem to want my money even when I was desperately throwing it at them. The credit card reader didn't work no matter how many different ways I swiped my card. Eventually, I paid for an hour of free internet on my phone and transferred it to my iPad. The flight was halfway through at this point. I fly this route (BOS-ORD and back) several times a year to visit family. American Airlines is absolutely awful, and the most ironic thing is that we booked with United out of spite for American.

We had booked the ticket 10 months ago and had payed high price for it, but still got the worst seat when flighing to and fro. One time we were assigned the last row seat next to the toilet and when came back they give the seat next to exit by the wing. Both the seats could not be adjusted. I don't understand how they assign seat? I had self checked 24 hours go, but I still got the worst seat. After paying a high price ticket they wanted an other 75$ if I wanted a better seat.

On top of that sitting on the last row with my daughter, I sent my wife and son on row 15 two lunches with the flight attendant, which never got to them. Food was given to someone else.

Next was the surprise that there's no lounge access for First Class passengers unless you're a frequent traveler. Yes, first world problem but with service-oriented airlines that'd be a ""no go"". Everything from boarding to disembarking goes by ""not yelling is already friendly enough"". Old 757 aircraft (not unexpected with United). Inflight entertainment screens the size of my phone and no on demand program. The real disaster though was the general condition of the aircraft. It was filthy. My personal highlight was the tray table. This one has not been cleaned in a long time. Although the flight wasn't bumpy, the coffee came in a mug that was clearly spilled over, but hey, who cares. Seated in row 1 as well gave me the pleasure of a free foot bath as obviously either the galley or the bathroom on the other side of the wall had a leak. Luckily it was only water soaking the carpet, my bag and my shoes. Here as well just shrugging shoulders when I asked for help. I really travel a lot around the world but there's no other airline that every time manages to underwhelm. United is a disgrace for Star Alliance who normally offers a premium product (LH, TG, LX, SQ, OZ and so on).

united-airlines;2017-04-13;" |  So not helpful and illogical. Showing up at the Aspen terminal for a flight to LAX, there were low clouds/ground fog that prevented the incoming aircraft from landing. Certainly not United's fault. Thus, this plane - intended to carry us to LAX - was diverted to the nearby, out-of-the-weather airport in Grand Junction. Those passengers were then bused up to ASE. Our complaint is that our flight group wasn't offered a ""return"" trip on that bus down to where the plane was residing (and wound up spending the night on the tarmac) at Grand Junction Reg Airport. No, we were all told - in spite of the inclement weather with promise of more to come - to ""come back early tomorrow morning. that plane will surely be able to get in here for you."" Doubting this, we nonetheless secured an (expensive) one night unplanned additional stay nearby, awoke at 3:30 am Sunday, and got a ride back down to the still socked-in airport. Our intended plane went ahead and left Grand Junction not to come get us (it couldn't), but to head off to parts unknown. The weather was such that no plane wasn't getting in and the bus, was long gone. The bus that could have easily transported our departing group down to the plane in its nearby diverted location the day before. Frustration with the United gate agents at ASE led us, and several others, to rent cars (no easy task with such a limited inventory available at a small airport), and drive one-way to Los Angeles. Thank you so much, Hertz! 14 hours and $500.00 later (between the +1 night and rental car), United was out of our hair. The United gate agents seemed quite genuinely to not care a wit about the departing passenger's situations and needs. United bused the newly arriving folks in from the ""detour airport"", allowing that bus to subsequently dead-head off to who knows where. Why the devil wouldn't they get us out of the weather-plagued ASE location (which closes at night - no sleeping at the airport here, fyi) down to the plane. Our plane. Just sitting there. Why indeed.";NEGATIVE

Also the headphones were broken. Cabin crew was very welcoming and friendly, on the other hand. As for food, it was not so great but I've eaten worse. We started-off late from Frankfurt and I was a little worried because my transfer in Chicago was tight so it was a huge relief when the captain informed us we landed on time in O'Hare. Too early! It turned out the airport didn't have a gate ready for us and we were standing 45 minutes on landing field. Then my transfer become really tight and I literally had to run through the entire O'Hare. Fortunately, the aircraft to San Diego was waiting for me as they knew flight from Frankfurt had issues with the gate. My baggage didn't make it on time to the San Diego flight but United sent it over to my hotel a day later. Overall, compared to Lufthansa with which I was returning, United was an average experience at best. It definitely isn't the worst airline in the world.";NEGATIVE

My first impression when checking in the staff seemed friendly but pushed for time meaning the service was quickly over, although it was fast it came across rude when they would hurry me and my travelling friends along. When boarding the aircraft we were welcomed by a lovely set of crew that were happy to point us in the direction of our seats, I was confused as to why there were not any other crew members in the centre of the aircraft welcoming us, like on other airlines I have flown with, all the flight attendants seemed to be in the back galley chatting amongst each other. After takeoff the flight attendants started the service offering drinks, smiling didn't seem like an option for many of the crew I was confused as I noticed across the middle seating that the other crew members were bright and cheerful. The inflight meal was rather poor, I had two options one that I was told was pasta and the other chicken, that's about as much information that I was given so I chose the chicken -  it was hardly chicken when there was about four smaller pieces of chicken inside and some bread and a side dish the cheese sauce was vile as it was getting cold by the time the cart had reached me. During the flight two medical emergencies came up with the group I was traveling with, the flight attendants were quick to react and made sure that both passengers where okay. They asked for any medical professionals to step forward and the matter was resolved within around an hour after departure when a travelling nurse was able to help. I think the inflight entertainment system was really great to occupy those who couldn't sleep.

In calling to try and find a set of seats that we could sit together the only seats that they could find were at row 37 where we were split between row 8 and 25 previously. They also then wanted over 100 dollars to upgrade one seat where I was offered nothing for moving backwards in seating. They also offer no support for the consumer nor do they recognize those that have traveled most of their adult life, if it were not for all of the continental lifetime miles I would chose an alternative airline company to fly and if Alaska Airlines had a better connection out of Houston it would probably be the best of those I have flown recently.";NEGATIVE

It is always rude and abrupt, like we are interrupting their day. The last time, my husband's bag was supposed to be at a certain carousel, he waited for over 45 minutes while an employee ""looked for it"", then a completely different employee brought it to him and said it was on a different carousel, #9 in fact, and ""didn't everyone know that carousal #9 is where to look for missing bags?"" There was even a woman behind him, with an infant in her arms, whose bag was sent to a different state altogether and was told she could either wait a few hours in the airport (the infant presumably) or it would be delivered to her the next day, but that she would have to be there at her home to sign for it. When she asked what time would it be delivered, they honestly said ""sometime."" Seriously. The woman explained that she needed a more concrete timeframe, so the employee replied with ""sometime before 5 or 6 pm.""

However, with United's new Polaris Business class on the BHX to EWR leg those days are over. Polaris is a product that is truly up to international standards. Whilst the 757 seating is the same as before the whole soft product is a massive improvement. From the time you reach your seat with its pile of Saks Fifth Avenue bedding topped by a cuddly polar bear teddy, to disembarkation I felt looked after. A brochure explaining the product including the menu was handed out as was an excellent amenity kit. Tasty food well presented with lots of little touches. I would highly recommend it. The ratings are based on this leg. Unfortunately the success of Polaris just went to show how far behind the P.S. business class with the same flat bed seating, which was on the EWR to LAX leg, was. No amenity kit, limited bedding, single sheet menu, adequate but not exceptional cabin staff. I lowered my expectations and it was alright.

They literally waited until I was boarding to inform me of this! How does that make any sense at all. If you don't have the tickets don't sell them. To top it off they tell me they're not sure if they will be able to refund them. 5 days later after I called highly upset they magically get refunded back to me. A week later I'm in a pinch and give them a chance to redeem themselves. Flight gets delayed which is fine but they told everyone it would be delayed 25 minutes. The flight left 1.5 hours later. Nobody on the flight could make their connecting flights and they offered nothing for us! The staff didn't even care that people were upset and now most likely had to sleep in DC they just continued to take their good Ole time with everything. Can't wait to land and see kind of BS they offer me for causing me to now miss work and my family tomorrow.  If you have a choice between horseback and United Airlines choose horseback you'll get their faster and have the actual service you paid for. If I could leave them less than a star for everything I would.;NEGATIVE

Okay, you have plenty of legroom but you should be aware that the proximity of the Economy cabin lavatories means that you will have people tumbling over your legs the whole night. Apart from that the seat is lacking any cushioning (maybe because it is so worn after 16 years of service) so it becomes a pain after a while. And then you need to accept that all that premium eco thing does not buy you any better food service that is - compared with other airlines - simply really poor. Not that it tastes bad but the amount of food you receive is simply poor. Imagine getting a croissant in the morning coming along with a micro-sized jam pack but no butter. Imagine asking for a glass of wine >and< a glass or water and you will only have the choice between one of the two. All in all pretty disappointing, will try to avoid them next time.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2017-03-28;" |  Flew UA business class Boston to Beijing in September 2016. Outbound was via Chicago, with a short [<2hrs] connection via Chicago scheduled on return. Given that my return time to Boston had become critical, staff at ORD suggested paying fee [$450] to return via San Francisco the day prior, which I then did. Beijing  to San Francisco leg was delayed departing, and arrived at SFO gate with 50 mins before scheduled SFO-BOS leg. I made it to gate but was informed that my itinerary [in First] had been switched, to a coach seat 4hrs later. At this point, UA were still offering first class seats for sale [including mine] on both the original SFO-BOS leg and also the later SFO-BOS flight.  This generated some amusement from the UA baggage handlers and gate staff which was at best disrespectful. After 30 days back and forth they refunded the class difference sum [$220 from a total of >$3400] but refused to refund change fees or offer explanation regarding selling on available seats [including mine] or offering a First class seat option [which I had paid for]. As a result, this was my last ever UA flight. I have flown BOS-PEK and BOS-LHR eight times since this incident with other carriers and have been rewarded with premium level service in the air and on the ground. It would seem that corporate greed trumps customer service even on business/first at UA so this makes it a non-starter for corporate travel where relationships and dependability matter the utmost.";NEGATIVE

However, it delayed to 2PM due to mechanic issues. What is more annoying is that they postpone the flight by every half hour, meaning that they said it would delayed to 11:xx. When it was getting closer to the delayed time, they delay again to 12:xx. Again, when it was almost 12:xx, they delay it to 1:xx. Several times!  The most annoying thing is that they didn't even know when it could fly, and they came to ask your decision, if you wanted to fly today, or tomorrow! OK, if it was myself, I could handle it. But the traveller was a 72-year-old, non-English speaker. Because of this delay, she missed her second flight from SFO to Shanghai. She definitely needed assistance in SFO, either logde into an hotel or some place for rest. When I call United's customer service (headquarter), they couldn't connect me to their branch in SFO. My mother-in-law had to find the United counter by herself. When I asked what to do with her checked-in luggages. They said my mother-in-law needed to picked it up from carousel and re-check it! Isn't it you messed up the trip.  In the past 2 years, UA has delayed my flight for at least 3 out of 5 times for mechanic issues. My advice is: stay away from UA and save your time.";NEGATIVE

As Star Alliance Gold holder, I was very surprised to learn, that United gives zero priority to Star Alliance members outside of their own MileagePlus program. There was no way I could be put onto the upgrade wait list, although I had an up-gradable Economy ticket (B-Ticket). It seems United only allows their own MileagePlus holders to be put on wait list. For me this was very frustrating, as there were a couple of people who were upgraded to Business on the subjected flight. I honestly don't understand why United is even a member of Star Alliance if they don't treat all Star Alliance program holders equally. On top of that, the quality of service is mediocre and I cannot recommend United as carrier.";NEGATIVE

This airline is cheap and not customer-service oriented. The outgoing flight was not any better. WiFi plugs did not work and no TV screens on such a long, boring flight.

United reimbursed us $175 total for our two tickets on the the Burlington to Newark leg and offered 2 x $150 flight vouchers (which, after a minimum $15/ticket ticket servicing fee reduced the value to at best $135 each). The hassle, aggravation and lost vacation time were truly a disappointment. United's recompense was minimal. I've been a United mileage plus member for years.

My flight from San Francisco to Denver was delayed as the aircraft comes in from Auckland before proceeding to Denver. Once on-board the service was very good indeed and very personal and pleasant. First Class fares in the US are not much more (if at all) than many economy fares in Australia so I suspect economy/coach passengers in the US on United have little to complain about - there is no such thing as a free lunch! The United Club before boarding was fine except the food offerings were not so good. Picking up a boarding pass coming in from an international flight was not so good either - very slack staff, However, once on board, I really enjoyed being able to chat to the flight crew on boarding and afterwards as well as the good wine. The United DBA express onwards to Lincoln was fine, even in economy. I would happily fly United again..";POSITIVE

The airplane was an old Boeing 747 not adapted to new onboard entertainment technology so you had just two options: you could either try to follow a movie through one of those old screens that was just a meter away to the left from my seat or you could watched though your laptop. Unfortunately, they forgot to tell that you needed to download a plug in prior to board so the option was useless. You had an additional option: purchasing wifi to download it. I did it, but the plug in never worked and no-one seemed to know how to fix it, of course. So I spent my flight watching FB (of course, when you leave China). The flight was packed with Chinese families that don't seem eager to educate their children to live with other people. I had to ask for help because a child was yelling and playing with his father endlessly. The hostess was successful in stoping the yelling but couldn't avoid the family speaking all the way to San Francisco.

united-airlines;2017-03-07;" |  United Airlines San Francisco to Singapore flight was run by a very senior Continental crew with a flight time of 16.5  hours. I was given access to the United First Class lounge which was located closer to the boarding area of the flight. The Business Class section was 2x2x2 seating, causing window passengers to cross over their seat mates. The service was excellent and the food and wines were good, however, I did not get my first choice, fish. So much for ordering the white wine and ending up with beef. My main complaint was that the fasten seatbelt sign came on at least 12 times during the flight and it was a smooth flight. Several times one little bump would cause the fasten seatbelt sign to appear, which would trigger the recorded announcement, ""Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign. For your safety and for those around you, please return to your seat and fasten your seatbelt."" A flight attendant would then do the message in Chinese. The television monitors (many which were turned off) would all turn back on and with a bright white background with the message a special announcement is in progress. This certainly lit up the entire cabin. I would strongly recommend that if you fly on United's 787 aircraft, you bring good earplugs and eye shades. In short, United is not a good airline if you want to sleep on the flight. This was a smooth flight and the flight attendants were never asked to sit down but I was woke up many times during the flight. Singapore Airlines does this same flight using an A350, which offers more room in economy and 1x2x1 seating in Business Class.";NEGATIVE

Finally after getting someone on the line supposedly the only flight they had was for us to leave at 3 in the afternoon on 4 March with getting us to Des Moines after 9 PM! As one gentleman (who was on a different flight but his flight got canceled for the same reason) put it ""They had all damn day to crunch the damn numbers"" and at 10 PM they figured this out. On top of this we got no hotel! We had to sleep in the airport. They had us running all over the airport to talk to their reps and fetch our luggage. In the end Delta had a flight that left Newark today at 6:55am est and had us home at 9:30am Cst.

Seats are well below comfort standards of most Asian airlines, and whilst I had experienced some reasonable serviced in a couple of United domestic flights, the flight attendants on this route were simply abysmal. When they were visible in the cabin they seemed to spend their time smirking and chatting to each other and customers were second priority. It was like watching children misbehave and just embarrassing. On the one hand their profits shoot up, but what customers get is terrible. I don't understand why US travellers stay loyal to such a faded, out of date and poor airline, but guess it's all about flyer points. Food was passable, IFE was quite good, but the bad service overshadowed all of this - never, ever again with United.";NEGATIVE

We have always traveled with Qantas and United you have a lot of catching up to do. Flight attendants were rude and unhelpful, the female attendants grooming was appalling, and food was the worst I have ever had on a flight. The staff were too busy playing on IPads rather than attend a passenger in need. The seat did not go back on a 16 hour flight and the volume on the tv did not work. ";NEGATIVE

Among my many United flights I have randomly picked this one as an example. The airline has gone through many rough patches over the last couple of years. Poor management has led to very poor performance by the company as a whole. Unmotivated front-line employees, unresponsive customer service agents, older dirty planes remain a hallmark of United. Recently, the company has revamped their lagging international business class but the nicer pillows and blankets are not enough to cover up the many other deficiencies. The flight discribed here was a case in point: tired flight attendants, delays, lost luggage, helpless customer service agents lying about measures taken. This flight had all of the catastrophes that I have come to expect from United Airlines. Many people and United employees were hoping that a new CEO could turn things around. It didn't happen and in fact United continues on a downward spiral with no end in sight. I'm sorry to say that I can only confirm the many terrible reviews here on Skytrax .";NEGATIVE

There were no televisions to be found on this flight to Hawaii, instead they want you to purchase their wi-fi. In addition they got passenger's seats wrong, families were broken up for family vacations and couples were split up who were on their honeymoon (us). No compassion, no staff attempted to right their wrong when we clearly picked our seats together before. Instead they left the scrambling passengers to swap seats, shuffling around attempting to get families and couples together. What a wonderful way to begin our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly United again. They clearly do not care about their passengers. Really no TVs on a 9 hour flight?! What a wonderful start to our honeymoon as I can barely see my new husband 6 rows in front of me.";NEGATIVE

What kind of refund customer service wouldn't tell you that they charge a $200 refund ticket change fee when the ticket is only $212.10 dollars.

We had a medical emergency for my wife 6 days prior and I submitted the info and they refunded all our costs with no issues. This is the first time I had to cancel a trip in 45+ years.

I am grateful to United Airlines for accommodating my desperate need to get back to Toronto ASAP. I even tried to get help from Air Canada, who I usually fly with and they would not help me. But United Airlines was the only airlines who would help me. I will always remember United Airlines and the compassion and courteous help that the woman who worked behind the service counter gave to me. She also went above and beyond by giving me a confirmed seat and not a standby ticket. This is what all customer service should look like and I am thankful to United Airlines.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2017-01-09;" |  Yesterday I traveled from Barcelona to Newark and was supposed to fly onto Austin. Once we landed in Newark, I saw that our Austin flight was cancelled.  I am here to complain about the level of service that they gave to try to get rebooked. Once someone's flight is cancelled, there should be appropriate staff to handle the volume. Every representative was rude, as if it is my fault my flight was cancelled. We were all treated like a nuisance. After going through customs, I was halfway directed to the customer service line. It was downstairs, so I tried to use the escalator across the way to go down with my huge international bag. An agent screamed at us that we could use the escalator right in front of us, to not use that one and clog it up. Well we told her the escalator is broken and we can't use it. She didn't care. For some reason we could not use use the escalator that everyone else 50m away was using. I am 7 months pregnant and carried my huge bag down those stairs. I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn't.  She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help. We waited for over 4 hours. I got sick from not eating or drinking and being pregnant, but if I got out of line, I would have to start over. 30 minutes later the two agents tell us ""well we are off now, you guys have to call. Bye."" They left us. A man yelled ""I've been on hold with them for an hour and a half already!"" Most of us in tears from being there so long. I was there 4.5 hours, I don't know how long the people in the front were there. Unfortunately my phone was stolen in Spain, so I had no way to call. Simply stuck with no way to rebook. I finally found another flyer who let me borrow their phone. I understand cancelled flights, but you need to take care of your paying customers. I have never been treated that way. I am very upset, even today. ";NEGATIVE

I get to the airport and they delay my 8:50 pm flight about 6 times, to the point where it's 1 AM. They tell everyone the flight is cancelled because they cannot find a pilot. On top of randomly canceling the flight after the many delayed, they do not bother to accommodate us with a voucher for a taxi back home or a hotel. They just simply said to call the airline and book another flight. Not to mention how rude and unprofessional one of the ladies at the gate was. When I asked her for information on booking the next flight she gave me an attitude and didn't even answer my question. When I called their customer service phone number and spoke to a supervisor he as well spoke to me in a very unprofessional manner and seemed very careless to hear anything of what I had to say. He didn't bother finding me any sort of accommodation either. It was so unfair that I had to drive to the airport in the terrible weather, to 5 hours later be told the flight is cancelled. And then that I had to pay for my own transportation back home. There were so many angry customers because everyone was pretty much stuck st the airport and United Airlines refused to help!  Terrible experience and I will never fly with them again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2017-01-05;" |  Salt Lake City to Chicago. First, we were late for takeoff by approximately 30 minutes, just sitting at the gate. While this isn't usually a big deal, someone came on the speaker and said ""I'm really not sure why we haven't been cleared yet."" Really? Then why bother making the announcement? This lack of explanation was more concerning to myself and those was around me than saying nothing at all would have been. The seats were so close together, and I'm only 5'2"" and 110lbs. This airline offers no snack options for individuals with Celiac's disease/gluten intolerance. Instead of giving passengers options from the cart, one flight attendant was giving everyone small blue bags of some sort of trail mix. The flight attendant had a cart full of snacks he could have been offering. When I asked if he had any gluten free options, he said ""I can't tell you if it's gluten free but you can look in the menu and try to buy something."" He couldn't be bothered with telling me the other options he had in his cart. When I looked at the menu the only completely gluten free option offered was a small bag of popcorn that costs almost $6. I asked the other flight attendant if there were any snacks like bananas, ""kind"" trailmix bars, or baked potato chips in the front of the plane. Her response was ""I don't know but the snacks for up front are you know, for up front."" So instead of sacrificing one snack item from the front of the plane that probably costs less than a dollar in actuality, both attendants left me with no food for the duration of the flight. I flew with Delta last week and they were much more accommodating and pleasant. While they did not have gluten free snacks in economy either, the attendants did manage to find a banana and a ""kind"" bar for me in ""the front"" of the plane, after I only mentioned my gluten intolerance to them once. In comparison, Deltas entertainment system is also far more superior to United's. The only positive thing I can say about this trip with United is that my neighbor (after buying an hour of wifi for $8) did mention that the wifi connection was good. I've never had wifi connectivity issues on any plane though, so I'm not sure this says much.";NEGATIVE

It all started with a simple 30 minute delay, which then crumbled into a mess. The original time was 6.40 pm and that time was delayed three times. After the third time they delayed it for good, meaning United delayed the flight for 13 hours. If that was not an inconvenience I do not really know what is. Not to mention that I was also relying on a connection flight that I also missed because of the unclear reasons given. United did me a ""favor"" by booking me another connection flight with a 7 hour layover. I needed to be home that day but instead I get to waste 7 hours of my day in an airport. What makes this even worse is the fact that they did not compensate any of the passengers on the plane. Fast forward and it's the next morning. You get up at 5 am and drive to the airport and get on the plane. The plane arrives at an airport where your connection is. Time is getting closer to the departure time and then it happens. The flight is delayed once again. This time it's for 3 hours (keep in mind I needed to be home a whole day ago). Now they apologize and say they can't do anything about it. This is probably the worst airline out there. United does not care about its passengers nor compensating the people they mess around.";NEGATIVE

At 7.30am no one had started boarding and no one announced anything over the speakers. The screens still said the flight was on time. The delay time changed on the screen every hour, pushing the flight time further into the day. I am traveling with my cousin and the only way we found out about the delays were through automated text messages sent to her phone. No one announced anything over the speakers to us while we waited at the gate. I am fine with a delayed flight, but it's been 8 hours. When we tried to ask about what was going on with our flight, the woman at the desk avoided all eye contact and walked away. We didn't see her again. We went downstairs to the main desk and asked about other flying options and the woman at this desk said we didn't have any other options. We hopped on the website afterwards and figured out we could change it ourselves. Very poor customer service. These workers don't seem too concerned about answering any of our questions. Our flight was delayed so many times due to ""maintenance issues"" eventually they gave up and switched planes. The plane we are now on is apparently having problems too.

I booked my flight on the lufthansa homepage, and if I would have known that I'm flying with United I would have never booked it. Just a brief look at the Skytrax rating showed me what I should expect and the reality is even worse. The entertainment system was broken, my front seat pocket was ripped, one toilet was out of order so lots of waiting people standing next to me during the flight.

In one trip they have managed to delay flights for over 24 hours on the front end, lose luggage and currently delayed returning flights for 3 hours. Their customer service workers are incredibly rude and not helpful.

We were ordered shortly after take off not to congregate or line up for toilets in the rear. Since we were up front making it to the toilet without anyone getting in front of you was impossible. Due to this fact I did not drink on aircraft as at 65 it can be painful to wait. We were offered no food as promised for our two hungry boys. They did get a third of a can of Sprite as this was their second long flight they asked for another drink of Sprite. They were refused. My wife asked for water instead politely. I asked for the purser to request an additional sprite as United advertises complimentary beverages. He did deliver. I thanked him profusely but now I was unbeknownst to me a marked man. I sat quietly until I was in dire need of a toilet. There were eight people in first class all sitting comfortably so I quickly used the front toilet. You would think I had threatened the aircraft. When I exited I was berated and demeaned by that same purser and ordered back to my seat. Where else I would go at 36,000 feet in the air was a mystery to me. I complied without incident. I did tell him quietly before landing he was a rude man for embarrassing me for using a toilet. On arrival the pilot came bounding out of the cockpit and had requested security at the gate. A toilet offense had apparently endangered the aircraft in some ridiculous fashion. He proceeded to lie about me talking to staff which had not happened. I was accused of blocking the aisle which had not happened. The security personnel dismissed the incident and we all went home. United is not passenger friendly and rather than attack or correct complaints they attack the complainer. ";NEGATIVE

The lines of people at the gates were long and moving very slowly as people were trying to get other flights and airlines arrangements. At 8 pm an announcement that the agents at the gates had to leave for the day, as they had completed their shifts.....all hell broke loose as people began running from the lines out to the ticket counters in the terminal to be closer to the front of the long line. There was about 200 people in line for one agent. Other airline's planes were leaving, but not United's. It was communicated to the passengers that the one de-icing truck United had for Kansas City had broken a line and was inoperable. So, without de-icing, no flying. A neighboring airline had 4 de-icing trucks, however, three of those were broken so United couldn't borrow one. Really, in Kansas City, no contingent plan for snow other than one truck. Waiting in a line that wasn't moving, called customer service to reissue tickets on a different flight. We were told no planes were going to fly out the next day, Sunday, but they could get us on a Monday morning flight. The employee lied to get us off the phone and move on to someone else, by just scheduling us on an easy flight without having to do research of flights that would get us home sooner. However, we took the scheduling and headed to the bank of hotels to find a place for two nights. At the hotel we did our own rescheduling and found a flight for Sunday on another airline, American and Mesa through Phoenix, AZ, at 5:50 pm. These also, were delayed and finally left KC, MO at 8 pm. United's service is very poor, we did not get our upgraded seats we paid for, nor have they offered when we asked for compensation.

Check-in was quick, TSA Pre-check was immediate, and boarding was done with discipline. We pushed back a few minutes early, and with a very strong tail wind, we landed 45 minutes early. I had the window seat in the first overwing exit row, and the middle seat was empty, so the seating was quite comfortable. There were, however, two areas where United fell short. Warm breakfast meals are supposedly available for purchase, but by the 8th row of premium economy, all options were sold out. This was an early morning flight and the catering crew should have anticipated a higher demand for meals. My second observation concerns the in-flight entertainment. I have the United app downloaded on my iPad, so I was able to access a variety of movies free of charge. There is also a very inferior flight map with some aircraft data. The in-flight map on Lufthansa allows you to identify villages, lakes, streams and other geographical features. The United map gives you an approximate idea of what state you may be flying over.

Depended on whom you asked: the crew was over their service limit. Customs in SXM wasn't willing to stay later to accommodate passengers. or The airline hasn't told us why.

Upon returning to the airport in the morning, there were a couple hundred people in line and no United staff at the check-in counter.

Crowd control at check-in was handled by other passengers. Check-in staff was surly. Departure was just after 1pm, which put us on the ground at IAD just after 4pm. As we deplaned, we went through the transfer channel as we were told only to find out that because of the manual check-in at SXM, our bags were only tagged as far as IAD.

I also asked if I could have a food voucher since I was going to be at the airport for an extra 14+ hours that I hadn't planned on and she said they don't provide food vouchers to people unless their flight had been delayed for four hours. No my flight was not delayed for four hours it was cancelled and I was at the airport an extra 14 hours!

Finally arriving hotel at 1:30 in the morning. We returned to the Airport the next day to attempt to leave once more. We were promised compensation by United Airlines and told to log in to their website under appreciation. Once I logged in, it did not recognize my flight number and could not proceed with my claim.

I had my seat selected and confirmed and paid in full of course. On the day of the flight I checked in. While waiting at the gate I saw on their United Airlines screen the names of 2 passengers upgraded to first class. Shortly thereafter I was called and I was told I was downgraded to coach because they were overbooked! They said they would give me a voucher of $250. I was appalled and I felt that I was cheated by United Airlines. The staff at United gate said they were overbooked and I was downgraded because my fare was the lowest of all the first class passengers on that plane. But I paid full fare and it was the lowest probably because I bought the ticket 6 months in advance - but it was a full fare and it was still more than twice the fare of coach. The staff member said I could either wait 3 hours for the next flight or fly coach this flight. I asked why they upgraded 2 passengers to first class and downgrade me when I paid full first class fare. This staff member denied that they upgraded anyone. (Another passenger whom I didn't know later confirmed to me that she also saw on the TV screen 2 passengers upgraded.) I said I was going to complain because I felt that United Airlines cheated my money because I paid full fare for first class and they put me in coach for a voucher of $250. Their staff said, ""Go ahead to complain. I am just carrying out company policy."" They never even apologised the whole time.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-12-22;" |  Having flown Business Class from Bangkok on a A380 Thai Airways to Paris to connect to United Airlines business Class to Newark, the difference was striking. The United much hyped Polaris business class product was disappointing. Unfortunately the Polaris seats and configuration is still the old narrow flat seats in the 2-4-3 configuration where all passengers don't have aisle access and window and middle seats have to ask the aisle passenger to get up. On my flight, there was a extra Polaris trainer on board for the cabin attendants but still the service was not smooth or elegant. Polaris is suppose to understand that rest and sleep is primary to the business flyer but the meal service took at least 2.5 hours with them still beginning to serve the ice cream when the lights were already dimmed. There was such a long time between courses as if the attendents didn't know what to do. I was seated next to the galley and watched them being disorganized and clumsy as the curtain was not closed. The Thai Airways personal cabin attendant knew my name as she introduced herself and all the courses, refill of drinks arrived swiftly and effortlessly like magic from behind a curtain. The cabin was always a sea of calm and tranquil unlike United noisy clatter. The one thing that was superior on United's Polaris was the cuisine. The salad was fresh and the courses plated well and restaurant quality. If only if United's Polaris could train their cabin attendants to a much higher standard of providing smooth professional service as if in a quality restaurant rather than a busy diner.";POSITIVE

When I went to customer service to switch to another airline to arrive a little earlier, I was told that they only do this when a delay is more than 4 hours. When I asked ab out the cause, I was told that weather was the main cause. When I mentioned that there had not been significant weather anywhere in the country for two days, the comment was that they were still recovering.

united-airlines;2016-12-20;" |  I flew UA895, 12/16/16 from Hong Kong to San Francisco, then UA 638 from San Francisco to Houston. UA895 was 12 hours long, and was advertised as having inflight entertainment and wifi when I booked it. The aircraft was old, so it had no personal TVs on the back of the chairs, just the main one near bulkhead. Not a big deal, but about 45 minutes into the flight, we were told the WiFi wasn't working. They tried resetting it, then called tech support, but could not fix it. We were told that because it was considered a ""premium"" item, we wouldn't be compensated. I didn't expect compensation, but on a 12 hour flight, I expected some effort to be made to make everyone more comfortable. Instead, there were 4 children in our cabin and they took turns crying for the entire 12 hours. I understand kids cry, and I felt terrible for the parents, they looked fatigued. The kids would only stop crying when the parents walked the aisles with them or stood where they could see the TVs, which obviously wasn't sustainable for a multitude of reasons. I imagine the flight would've been much more enjoyable for the parents, children, and other passengers if the wi-fi had worked. Additionally, even the entertainment on the screen near bulkhead crashed mid flight and had to be re-set, so even that was flawed. My second flight, UA153, was scheduled to depart at 12:05pm. At first it was delayed by 20 minutes, ""due to delayed incoming aircraft."" I decided to look it up, and saw that the flight, UA424, Dulles to San Francisco, was originally scheduled from 08.50-12.06. Yes, the scheduled landing was for 1 minute after our flight was scheduled to depart. This is a terrible planning failure on behalf of United, who knowingly scheduled a flight they knew wasn't going to depart at the scheduled time. Our flight didn't end up departing until close to 2pm, after loading up around 1.15, and then taxiing for a long time. Multiple people on our flight had connecting flights, which were missed or they narrowly made it to, especially since United didn't accommodate or prioritize their exit from the aircraft. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing that United knowingly did this. There were over 100 people on the aircraft, all delayed an extra 1.5-2 hours, plus the people who missed their connecting flights and were even further delayed. United wasted 200+ hours of people's time that day. It seems extremely fraudulent that they knowingly did this. Last, I'm taking time to write this review this time, as every time I have flown United, I have experienced a delay of at least 1 hour. It is extremely disappointing as a customer. For example, on our flight from ORD to HKG, we were delayed by almost 5 hours. On a flight I took from DFW to XNA once, I was delayed by 4 hours. Unfortunately, this just seems to be something you have to expect and plan for when flying United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-12-19;" |  Seattle to Orlando via Chicago. As an American citizen traveling domestically, over the past 15 years, I've come to set the bar about as low as it can get for flying. That said, I will never fly United Airlines again. Enough is enough. My boyfriend and I had pre-selected our seats, yet did not have seat assignments after checking in. It's the holidays, so lines were long at check in. There was a woman in line with several suitcases, two of which were less than 4lbs over the weight limit. Instead of just taking pity on her and expediting the line by accepting her suitcases on the first, second, third and fourth times she repacked them, employees felt it was a better option to continue to hold up the line and create confusion as she kept having to drag her suitcases back and forth. Know when to just cut your losses. Because of the seating issue I was not able to sit with my boyfriend on the second flight. Upon landing, we learned that one of our suitcases was not on the plane, leaving my boyfriend with none of his things. We were told that it would be delivered to our hotel (2 hours away) by the end of the day. I am sceptical, but will see. My own brand new suitcase's retractable handle is now completely broken and won't budge from its retracted position. I was curtly informed that they are not liable for this damage. I have degenerative disc disease in my lower back, so it's very uncomfortable if not painful to try and drag my suitcase around without a retractable handle. So thanks a lot for that, United. We paid $25 per bag for this ""service,"" but no refund was offered. And they'll gouge us again on the way home. These weren't cheap tickets, with the time of year. My money will never go to United again.";NEGATIVE

I arrived to the airport 6 hrs early because of an emergency and I was not able to be moved to an earlier flight or wasn't given the option to fly standby for ""open"" flights without a $75 fee. I waited for my original flight which wasn't until 5:15 pm, just to get a text stating the flight was delayed one hour and fifteen minutes. The lady at the counter refused to look up my flight info and give me any options or additional information. I get on the plane at 6:07pm and sit until 7:45 because of issues with lighting. At this point I am now over 2 hrs behind schedule and the only accommodation they gave us were 9 movies to choose from for a 3 hour flight! The cable wasn't available for free (as they stated) until the last 30 minutes of the flight. Once we land of course my connecting flight took off without me due to us being 2 hrs behind schedule. We landed at 10:27 and my flight left at 10:00. I waited in a customer service line until 12:00 midnight. The people at the desk were taking people out of order and had attitudes when questions were asked. I was refused a voucher for a taxi home the next day and told to go online. I was accommodated with a hotel that I didn't get checked into until 1:40 in the morning with a shuttle coming to get me in two and a half hours. I was not able to locate my bags so I had to travel and stay at a hotel with nothing. I will never fly this airline again.  They don't accommodate you for anything. Their customer service sucks. I had to walk away from 3 employees because of their rude attitudes. The delays are uncalled for and a big inconvenience. Neither delay I had were due to weather!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-12-19;"Santiago to Denver via Houston with United. Today has been the most ridiculous travel day of my life. It started in Santiago as we boarded a plane for Houston. We ended up having a 3 hour delay due to a lack of ""maintenence papers"". Needless to say we missed our connecting flight to Denver. We were given another flight which we also missed because the bags took an hour and a half off of the plane. We then tried for 6 hours to get onto standby flight in IAH but we're unable to, a fault of none. Busy travel days and large airports make for difficult travelling for everyone. The food or the seats on the plane weren't really a problem either seeing as it should be expected that airlines are a pay to play service. Customer service, however, was unbelievable. We were lied to, ignored, spoken to rudely. Customer service lines took 3 hours to get to the front of and there was no noticeable attempt to fix it. However, not all of the customer service has been bad. The man who booked us our first two flights moved heaven and earth to re-book our first flight, and then get us another flight, with great difficulty, that same day. Besides him however, the United staff has been egregious. There is a line between doing the bare minimum of one's job and taking away from the business that a certain employee works for, and I feel many of the employees are toeing, if not well over the line. I wouldn't recommend United to anyone.";NEGATIVE

Due to extreme weather conditions the flight was cancelled. After a long wait of 3 hours with only a single person to rebook all customers in other flights, we finally got our turn to speak with the staff. We were given only one option that is, ""You have flight only the following day and there are no more available for today"". I understood their situation as they could not provide me with any flight for that day as there are no seats available. After long waits we finally reached home with boarding passes for the following day.  We woke up early again in the morning and checked the status online on United Airlines website. It mentioned there is a delay in flight timings but the scheduled time of departure is still shown at 6.10 am. I thought they will send an email or a text message incase if there is really one. And once again after paying for the cabs and reaching there on time we found that the flight is delayed by 4 hours. I felt deceived. I spoke to an attendant as to why I was not informed about the delay and she told I will get back to me in a moment and went on serving the customers at other kiosk without ever bothering to respond me. I then waited for 15 minutes to speak with another one and she asked how I made my resevation and I explained her it was through Priceline. And she tried to blame them as it is their fault and they have to inform me. I told her that these were new boarding passes which were issued by United Airlines at the kiosk. Her response ""Yeah right. I dont know"". I told her it is not a problem if there is a delay but it is your responsibility to inform me so that I would not have come early. Her response, ""I know but i cant do anything. You could wait at the airport or leave and then come back at around 9.30 am as that is when the boarding starts"". Is she going to pay us for the cabs? Cant they see what efforts we might have gone through to come to airport in the icy conditions with heavy luggage? She then tried to blame the weather when I told her the flight to and from the same locations in Southwest is running at scheduled time. Then she said, ""I don't control anything here. I don't know why the scheduled time in website was not updated"". In the end, I have to leave the counter with frustration. I dont see an inch of regret or an apology from their side for their mistake. We just sat there doing nothing and looked at the timings of other flights. There were few other flights whose status is either cancelled or delayed and all of them belonged to United Airlines. ";NEGATIVE

In my experience, United Airlines consistently fails to get their planes off the ground on time. In addition to delays, I always have a better quaity experience with other major airlines. For instance, during my 6 hour flight last night from Honolulu to Denver, we were brought drinks 2 times, and no snacks were offered. Last month on a very similar (yet longer, approx. 8 hour flight) trip with Delta, they provided two complementary full, hot meals, many rounds of drink service, and they even came through the cabin 4 times with individual 16 oz bottles of Dasani.

They promise that if we lose our connection I will have a hotel and vouchers for food. When I arrived at the United customer service at Houston Airport, they said that It was not a record of the maintenance. So weather does not pay for the hotel. They denied that it was maintenance.

He introduced all the crew and also explained that he was holding the flight for a passenger on an international connection since this was the last flight to RDU that evening. But even with the hold we would get to RDU early. Flight was reasonably smooth with occasional bumpiness but the captain changed altitude several times to find smoother air. Cabin staff were pleasant and the premium economy seating was fine (though it was the most expensive premium economy I have purchased on any of the 3 legacy carriers.)

Same seat as before, but with a bunch more stuff, including a “polar bear” teddy bear, so there’s no space to put anything. Of course, having a teddy bear didn’t guarantee that I’d have a menu (which I had to ask for) nor an amenity kit with ear plugs - which I sorely needed because the guy beside me started to snore loudly just after takeoff. Once the bell indicated that the crew could get out of their seats and start the service, I used the FA call button to ask for an amenity kit to get some ear plugs. The FA working in my section came to me and said that I should not to use the call button because it was loud and would disturb other passengers. His telling me that woke up the guy beside me. So much for not disturbing other passengers. I was amazed and annoyed. I’ve never been told in a premium cabin on any carrier not to use the call button. Why did I have to use the call button? I got on board and had no menu, no amenity kit yet somehow I had a teddy bear, pillow, two blankets and a rude flight attendant who told me to just signal him when he’s in the aisle. I did that and got an arms crossed “what would you like” rude stare. The movie selection consisted of exactly six movies. My tray table would not come out, so I had to leave my seat while the same FA who told me not to use my call button yanked on it to the point where it finally ejected from its slot, but, in the process, toppled over my drink. Now a piece of the siding underneath where the table is stowed is unhinged and flapping loosely. Who’s got a piece of tape? To top it off, my appetizer was frozen (including the salad) and the bread was cold and stale. Good luck, UA, with Polaris. So far, not impressed. Same miserable UA crew with bad attitudes (although the Cabin Service Director was polite and apologetic when I told him what his colleague had said to me about the call button).

Flight to Ireland was a better experience with good leg room, choice of movies on demand and a good quality meal which consisted of a starter and main course, followed by an Ice cream and bottle of water as a separate serving, which was a nice touch. The flight had turbulence mid way over the Atlantic, but the Captain kept us well informed and ascended throughout the flight to avoid as much of the turbulence as possible. Crew were very friendly, helpful and professional throughout the flight. Landed ahead of time in Shannon, Captain even met the passengers on the airbridge and thanked us for flying with them, a very nice touch. Overall United offer a good experience especially on the transatlantic sector and fantastic route connections in Newark.";POSITIVE

Upon arrival at SD I was informed the plane was experiencing ""mechanical issues"" AKA ""we undersold the flight and are going to merge it with another"". The attendant offered online vouchers which he said would be available after the flight had departed. They weren't. I am a celiac and I did not pack food because I was having dinner in Chicago that night which, I missed. Airplane food at best is inedible but add gluten free and you're stuffed. I packed nothing because I didn't think I was going to need to. Error! The flight landed in O'Hare at 10.30pm and of course everything on a Monday was shut. By the time I got to my Hotel room and went back out to look for food it was 12.30. Upon return that week I wrote to United as speaking to a human is impossible. Anyway they were so generous in offering me a whole $50 dollars in flight vouchers. Luckily I won't be able to cash them in because I would never fly (voluntarily) United. It was the second time this year and the last for a long time I hope. The few dollars saved just didn't add up the the trauma of flying with this outfit. Never again.";NEGATIVE

I was very upset because that would have meant I would miss out on Christmas eve dinner and all our family Christmas eve traditions. I was so disappointed at my mistake, especially since I don’t get to see my family very often. I called United, expecting them to only offer to sell me another ticket or charge me a large fee because that is my experience with most airlines. But to my surprise, the woman on the phone was very friendly and helpful and offered to change my flight, with no fees, to the morning so that I could make it home for our family’s Christmas celebrations. I was so relieved! This past October I flew United to Europe and will continue to use them in the future and highly recommend them to others.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2016-11-28;" |  I will never fly United again and this is why. I was to depart Cleveland to Chicago on 26 November at 6:35pm. We did not leave the runway until 8:25pm for a fuel overfilling. I have never heard of such a thing! There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p. My connecting flight was to depart Chicago at 8:50pm and boarding stopped at 8:35pm. I asked several flight attendants if my gate could be called and I was told they couldn't control that. It seemed like I was the only person on this plane with that connecting flight. There were others going to Istanbul Turkey that United called ahead for them not to miss their connection. An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am. For a travel trip that should not have been more than 50 minutes in the air, I ended up spending almost 9 hours to reach my destination. To say this is unacceptable is an understatement. ";NEGATIVE

After committing to my flights 5 months prior to the departure date the departure and layover times were changed 4 times. I contacted my booking agent and United Airlines and neither were sympathetic to my problem. They have you sign off on each change to ensure you don't take advantage of the accumulated delays which would warrant some compensation in the form of changing flights more to my requirements. Now for the entertainment on the flight. The video would stall every 10 minutes and you would loose 10 seconds of the movie. Overhead old style screens made it difficult to view from my window seat. United online movies would have been an option but without a power charging jack it was not an option. Food was terrible on the United leg of the flight. Soggy breaded chicken swimming in sodium laddened gravy. The ANA flights provided exceptional quality on both food and entertainment. Price was good but I question the true value.

When I got to the airport and casually stated this fact to the United crew, they put me on a flight that flew me directly to Denver from Orlando.

If given the option, take a different airline. In addition to their inability to manage the flight leg, their planes have uncomfortable seats and are usually too hot.

The delay ended up being 2 hours. For the first part of the trip we sat at the gate at LA, but eventually pushed back and sat out on the tarmac somewhere until we got clearance from San Francisco. Understandably some passengers were upset because of possible missed connections at SFO, but weather is what it is, and an airline can't help that. Some opted to disembark before we pushed back from the terminal. The pilot was very courteous and apologetic. You could tell he cared as he tried to work whatever magic he could to get us out as early as possible. He was even apologetic over the the way some of the ground crew was apparently dealing with customer concerns which he felt wasn't totally what it should have been. Some things he apparently overheard and apologized for. The cabin crew onboard the flight was pleasant as well (though I think it would have been cool if they had offered water, or peanuts or something as we sat waiting. Since we really didn't know how long it was going to be.) Still I felt the flight and cabin crew handled it as well as they could. And I got a great price (even with the upgrade, which at 6'3, the extra leg room was nice considering the predicament that ensued).";POSITIVE

Had to visit their customer service and have never been treated so badly in my life. Several people already lined up for the agents and when I finally got to the agent, she informed me that she wouldn't help me because she was now off duty.

They put 6 seats in a row (very narrow seats, no privacy, no place to rest your arms) which means United Business Class is more like a Premium Economy but sold at the same price as the much better business class seats offered by airlines from Europe or Asia. The food and service are also rather poor. The lounge is poor (they even charge 5 US$ for a Sam Adams beer even for passengers that paid international business class) with little choice of food and no pre-dining options. Avoid flying United Airlines if you can. Airlines from Europe or Asia have a much better product to offer for the same or lower prices.";NEGATIVE

After 20 minutes we had a flight delay of 2 hours. While waiting in the customer service line for quite some time the flight changed again and again and yet again. Apparently the plane had already been sitting for 3 hours with mechanical issues. The flight was ovebooked by 5 seats. One by one all of the PA flights were getting delayed. We just wanted to obtain our luggage, get a rental car and go home. The very rude customer rep basically told us we were crazy saying it was overbooked and it was impossible to get our luggage. Finally our flight was canceled. We were offered a bus service. All we had to do was go here, then there, then here and then there again. United had very little contact with the shuttle service people and did not want to deal with us any longer. After a total wait of 4 hours getting the run around and lied to and treated like this was our fault we were finally on the road back to PA. While we should all be tuckedd away at home at the early hour of 1 am we will be lucky to make it to HIA and then get home before the sun rises.

We got to the airport early, boarded our plane on time (United Express Plane), first flight of the morning, and had to deplane due to a hydraulic pump failure. So all 11 of us went back into the airport and we're told it was a quick fix. About a half hour later we got back on the same plane, took off and we were in the air for 10 minutes, and then told we had to go back to Albany due to the same pump failing again. Why was this not tested in the morning before the first flight goes out? Why would we get back on the same plane with mechanical issues? So after getting off the plane for a second time we went back to speak with the gate staff who were less than helpful. None of them knew what was going on, no updates were provide and none of them spoke English clearly. We ended up mapping our own way from Albany to Philadelphia, Philadelphia to Miami, spending the night in Miami, and getting to Jamaica the next day by noon. All of these inconveniences will be paid for by United, and they even sent us each $50 vouchers, which we will not be using because we plan to never fly with United again. The story doesn't end here, our flight from Jamaica to Newark boarded late, no big deal we got there. As soon as we landed we were notified that our final flight from Newark to Albany had been delayed over 2 hours with no explanation. So, we sat in the airport for another 5 hours, not receiving updates as the gate staff still did not speak English, and were sarcastic and rude, as if our questions were stupid. Finally we boarded the express plane (that smelled like it had never been cleaned before) at 10:30, just making it out of Newark for the night and landed in Albany a little before midnight. We lost a day and a half of our vacation, spent hundreds of extra unplanned dollars and even considered just going home all because of United Airlines. We will not be using our vouchers they gave us because we will not be flying with them ever again. We will be flying with Southwest from now on like we used to.

That was only if the any type of entertainment was offered for the 6 hour flight. Had to use my ipad for entertainment. On the way back they would not offer internet due to unavailable for transocean flight, (even though it was on the previous flight to Hawaii) which price for both flights were identical. United offer a direct tv option only with excessive credit card charges. It should also be mentioned that they even showed pricing for flights that were over 2 hours were charged more per movie.

When we told her she assured us that because it was another United Flight they would call ahead and let them know we would be delayed and to hold the flight. She also told us we would be arriving at the same terminal as our departure terminal C. She assured us she would allow the passengers with connecting overseas flights to disembark first.

I was so worn out by this time we walked back to the front desk and she said she would call operations - they got permission to open the door and let us on. When we went to find our seats there were people sitting in them so we stood trying to see what to do. Eventually I said to a flight attendant who was ignoring the situation do you think you can help us. She came and walked us round and round to try to find seats for us. I spotted two seats across the aisle from each other and said we will take those seats. I would also like to remind you that we booked this flight and our seats in May 2016.

Two meals and a snack was given, but passengers were welcomed to go to the galley for more. Passengers were advised not to congregate at the alley, but for such a long flight, it will be good to allow passengers to walk around, mingle with the crew (provided not disturbing their duties) and also mingle among the passengers themselves, to sit still throughout 16+ hours on own seat will be kinda tough.

No offers of compensation/complimentary alcoholic beverages, etc. All this just compiles my last two horrible flights with United, where my luggage was lost twice and customer service just stared at me like cows chewing cud when I asked if I could be compensated for that mess. The hardest-working people for United are the outsourced staff in Pakistan and India, who were the most helpful people I have spoken to when I've had to contact United customer service.

On our way down to MCO we had a connecting flight in Newark, NJ. We boarded the plane as normal in Hartford and we were on it for 2 minutes before being told to get off because there was something wrong. We departed the plane and was out for another 2 minutes before telling us to reboard. We couldn't take off right away which made us late and when we finally did we knew we weren't going to catch the next flight. They told us to just go to customer service and get a new flight. When we reach Newark, we did just that. We got another flight pretty close to the other one. We boarded like normal, and five minutes in, they tell us they have to change the brakes. They said it would be a 30 min job. After that, they said they had to change a tire. That was supposed to be another 15mins. After that, they broke a piece and we weren't going anywhere. After that, they got a new piece and we were going. 20 mins after that we were finally in the air. We didn't land in Orlando until after 2pm, when we were supposed to be there at 11am. They offered us free alcoholic drinks because of the long wait. When my friend and I ordered she rudely asked for ID like we were lying or something and then made us split a drink instead of giving us one each. 4 days go by and it was time to go home. I received a text the morning of my flight (3am) saying that my flight will be delayed. This was the 3rd flight to be delayed. I had to go to Newark before Hartford as it was my connecting flight again. When we arrived at the airport and got to our terminal we asked about the delay and what to do about our connecting flight. The man at the desk said, ""I believe you will still make it, I can move your seats closer to the front to make sure you get off the plane in time."" We obviously believed him. It took us a while to get in the air and when we landed we rushed off and ran to our gate. It was closed. When I asked the man at the counter about it he said ""listen, I didn't work the flight."" I never asked if he did. I was then told to go to customer service. When I did so, the woman said she would put us on the 9:30pm flight to Hartford since that was the one leaving next. I was supposed to be in Hartford at 4pm. I didn't want to be in the airport for another 6 hours and get home by 10pm.

She then stated, and I quote, ""Well, you know what, you're here. At least you are here.""

Dublin airport offers pre-clearance and as such I was attracted to the flight with United Airlines. First impressions count and I am afraid that I was not at all impressed with the gate staff – some of whom were in United uniforms and boarded the flight after their gate duties. Their rudeness towards an elderly couple was disgusting and simply ignorant. Boarding was done in groups. Some passengers did not have their groups shown on their tickets and the staff had an aloof manners towards those who simply asked for the process to be explained. One staff member was particularly rude and obnoxious and seemed to enjoy being so. The flight is operated using a Boeing 757. The aircraft is rather comfortable but compact. The safety procedures were taken seriously and a video shown. During this flight I had to contend with an malfunctioning inflight entertainment system. Only a few TVs worked and the sound / volume was not controllable. The journey map did not work properly as only the distances were displayed. The couple next to me gave up on their IFE as theirs’s did not work either. My arm rest was not working correctly either. The catering was good and drinks were served regularly during the flight. I was impressed with the captain who made clear announcements and was very professional and welcoming. The Captain made a point of saying farewell to departing passengers in person. I had to collect my second boarding pass in Newark and the first uniformed United staff member I spoke to was indifferent and made no effort to even speak to me but pointed me along the concourse. The second uniformed United staff member I spoke to get my boarding pass was actually very friendly and polite and informative too. I also had positive impressions of ground staff who operated the transfer bus between terminals and could not praise them enough for being helpful.

Efficient boarding. Second United Airlines service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all three seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place. Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight. Houston - Sao Paulo: 100% full flight (the norm for Brazil - USA flights). Long delay at the gate with no explanation. Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping. Headrest folds but does not stay in place. 767 very noisy (probably more because of the fact that I just got off a 787). But a clean cabin and good service. Again a reasonable main meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water.

Leather type seats which I am not a fan of as they seem to cause you to slip down when sleeping.

A reasonable meal, good service and flight attendants constantly passing through the cabin with water.

Excellent check-in, completed in 5 minutes by very friendly staff member, including being told the great news that I would not have to pick-up my bags and re-check them for my connecting flight at IAH (which I was told is only done at IAH). Efficient boarding. Second UA service of the day to IAH, so the flight was quite empty (ended up with all 3 seats in the middle section to myself). The 787 was still very new and presented a very clean and airy cabin, helped by the larger than normal windows and lack of passengers. Comfortable seat with an excellent headrest which folds to support your head, and stays in place! Extremely quiet in terms of cabin noise (engines). Food service was reasonable and wine and beer served for free (premium drinks charged US$7.99 to US$8.99). WiFi worked very well for the entire duration of the flight (US$20 for the duration of the flight). Under-seat power supply (2 outlets for 3 seats) and USB charging from the screen. Flight attendants were efficient and friendly. Constantly walked through the cabin with water. Very pleasant daytime flight.";POSITIVE

It is quite ridiculous that the only food available on an 8 hour flight is offered for a ridiculous fee. The cramped seats are also deplorable and the only solution seems to be to pay a fee to have a reasonable amount of space. I would rather pay more for a ticket and have reasonable accommodations than pay not much less for a trip that sucks.

There was no one at the gate so I went to United customer service. This must have been the first time the idle group of 15 workers have ever heard of an overbooked flight as they could not process (cognitively) what I was offering. After a few minutes, they referred me back to the idle gate (which we could see no one was there). Realizing that this was idiotic, I walked to one of the other NYC bound flight gates as we have 3 major airports in the US's busiest city. The good news was that there was a half empty flight leaving in 30 minutes! The bad news was that United said it would be too difficult to swap with such short notice. Despite being 8 feet from the jetway and presented with a situation which was both beneficial for myself and United, this was yet another insurmountable task. The lady was kind enough to tell me that my overbooked flight (which I have a ticket for) is going to be 2 hours late though. I fly for work every week. I have to take the cheapest airline as a company policy. Why can American, Delta, JetBlue, Southwest and even Frontier figure it out, yet 100% of the time, United has excuses and animosity towards its customers? I feel bad throwing United employees under the bus because the only real difference between them and the other airlines workers is a lack of training. This total disregard for service is a corporate culture. How many scathing get reviews need to be written before anything is ever rectified. until United surprises us one time for the better?";NEGATIVE

After four flights with the airline I was quite impressed and would fly them again. The Boeing 777-200s used are showing their age with one plane still having an ash tray in the toilet. Good selection of movies to watch on the seat back tvs though the screen size is on the small size. Food was rather poor but come to expect that, beer and wine is free on international flights and there were frequent runs for water, tea and coffee and a nice touch that ice cream was offered mid flight, and just before landing they give you a cold snack. Flight attendants worked well during the flight and kept the passengers well fed and watered. All flights departed on time and arrived at the destinations early, the IAD-LHR arrived 50 mins early being a 6.20am arrival meant an easy exit through border control, getting luggage and exiting the airport in 20 mins. Would fly United again if the price is good.";POSITIVE

When I finally was able to reach an agent that spoke English, I was told that I had to physically pay United $200 to just use the credit. The $200 was not taken off the original $561, rather, must have been paid via credit card. The flight I needed was $170. On top of the $200 United already wanted me to pay, they were going to charge me an additional $200 to change the flight, $100 to book the flight through United and not a travel agent. In essence, I would actually be paying United close to the $561 credit owed to me for a $170 flight. Additionally, I spoke with three agents and all of them were rude and disrespectful. I was hung up on twice and the first person I spoke with could not speak English. I'm stunned that I have to pay to use a credit owed to me. It's not surprise that the airline is rated the worst airline and will most likely be bankrupt within the next few years. This company is crooked and I wouldn't recommend this airline to my worst enemy.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2016-10-18;"Newark to Los Angeles return. My flight to LA was fine and had no hiccups. My flight back home from LA however is another story! My flight was at 9:55, my friend and I were waiting at the gate (the gate listed on United's app which was verified by the employee's of the airport). At 10:00 we are looking at each other wondering why boarding or no announcements were made on the PA system. We go to customer service to find out that they made a last minute gate change (this happens often in airports and I've never had a problem catching flights using the App or listening to PA system). We were told we could be put on standby for the last flight that evening or have seats for an 8am flight the next day. Due to the fact that the gate change was not announced or alerted through the app we were not the only passengers having this problem. We later realized that they never made the announcement because they have over booked multiple flights and needed extra seats! After we were not able to get on our standby flight - due to overbooking, they asked for volunteers to give up their seats to be able to fit other passengers- We had to sleep in the airport (we asked for hotel accommodation and were told we would be reimbursed however the ""volunteers"" got vouchers right away). After sleeping in the freezing cold airport and finally boarding our flight, while giving our boarding passes we were told our reservation was canceled! The look of complete shock and anger was extremely difficult to hide and the customer service/flight attendant informed me that, ""If I wanted them to help us I would have to remove my attitude""! I did not even utter a word out of my mouth towards them to be met with such a comment? I let them know that it was their job to help me and no one was doing any favor's here. How appalling to have missed your flight, through no fault of your own and to be tossed around being reassured your tickets were confirmed and that everything was going to be okay only to be served with sass?! Mind you the entire customer service experience from since we missed our flight was horrible. Everyone had an attitude and blamed the passengers for their experience. I've never had this kind of experience when I've paid for a service/goods. My recommendation would be to give customer service and flight attendants courses on how to deal with customers. Overall I will never use this airline again. My only good comment would be for the staff on-board the plane. They were very pleasant and thoughtful.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-10-17;Calgary to Honolulu via Denver with Unted Airlines. We flew from Calgary to Denver on a CRJ-700. Service was very good and flight arrived on time. Aircraft was clean and seat was roomy. Bulkhead seats. 7A and B. We had a 3 hour layover in Denver and gave us time to explore the terminal building which we found very nice. Lots of eating establishments. Flight from Denver to Honolulu was very good. The flight attendants made numerous rounds for drinks and water. Originally we had booked seat 17A and B however the aircraft configuration was changed and we were seated in 20K and L. No problem as the middle seat was empty which gave us greater space. The flight was 95% + full. The crew were excellent and readily accommodated us and other passengers in a professional manner. I was most impressed when the Captain came to the front and gave us details concerning the light over the PA system. Very nice touch to the flight. Over all we were most impressed with United and will most certainly fly with them again;POSITIVE

Understandably bad weather, mechanical difficulties are things you just can't predict or change. However the reason we were given was that we didn't have a pilot as our pilot called in sick and it ""slipped"" through without another picking it up. After boarding we were told to get off the plane and then mid disembarking we were told we didn't have to. I will never fly with United again. Nice planes but the 66% reliability they receive as an airline isn't worth the extra frills.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-10-16;"United Airlines cemented its place as the worst airline company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. Other than small things like not giving us the seats we chose or putting my wife and I together, we had multiple delays, a very hard landing, unfriendly attendants and customer service. The whole experience was horrible and my wife and I were glad it was almost done with when we landed in SFO, our transfer point back to Tucson. Unfortunately it wasn't. I am now waiting for an hour or more for my bags as our flight was cancelled and I am now booked for another flight tomorrow to Denver and then finally Tucson (lets hope). The service reps were the most rude and unfriendly I have ever met and nothing was done to help us after the cancelled our flight. To make matters worse our flight was cancelled awhile before we were ever notified. The costs we are incurring due to them is not worth any amount of saved money for a cheaper ticket and we now have 12 hours of flying to get from Cancun to Tucson not counting the several hours of layovers. Luckily our trip other than United was amazing but I would not get on another flight from this company even if it was half the price of its competitors. I cannot really come up with a good point from the company except price and its partners airlines. Breakdown of review categories: Value for money is lowest possible because I don't find any value in their service. The price was good for our flight if they met any expectation but failed in all categories. Ground and Air Service were both rude and I would have given the air service one star if it wasn't for the ground service being significantly worse comparably. Seat comfort was normal for an American airline company but still far behind all foreign flight companies I have flown with. Beverages and food options are a bare minimum. There was pretty much no inflight entertainment with a couple of movies (at least this was free because of the many mistakes and delays they had already caused but normally very overpriced and outdated.) I hate knowing that when I book with ANA (my favorite airline) I have a chance to be stuck with flights from this company and may switch my primary airline to avoid this. (Sorry ANA) This review is only regarding my recent flight. I had several negative experiences prior but the relationship with ANA and price kept United as an option until today.";NEGATIVE

I'm a average size male and there is no leg room and very uncomfortable.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-10-13;"Boarding for both sectors was done early and by groups. Air traffic control delays at Bogota meant a 25 minute delay arriving into Houston. This flight was operated with a Boeing 737-700 and was packed. Cabin crew were ok if not somewhat lackadaisical. Perhaps it was the midnight departure. Announcements were barely audible. For inflight entertainment, this plane was equipped with DirectTV rather than the airline's far superior wifi delivered personal device entertainment. This meant having to pay to view the only 8 movies available - as the rest of DirectTV's content library is inaccessible outside the continental USA. Big Fail. The cabin was uncomfortably warm throughout the flight and coupled with the older seats, tight pitch and full load made it far less pleasant and also difficult to catch any shut eye. Strangely, a full meal is served on this sector at about 1.30am, which to be honest, wasn't bad. Made me wonder why our outbound to Panama from Newark of a similar duration and more appropriate departure time for a meal service, offered no complimentary catering. The crew did a few water runs until arrival in Houston. Transfer at Houston took longer than I expected owing to slow immigration clearance. However, I boarded the next flight with ample time to settle in. This aircraft was a Boeing 737-900ER with the newer seats, sky interior and wifi delivered entertainment. What a difference. It just felt more spacious. Seats were a bit more comfortable and legroom seemed to be better. Perception is everything I guess. The crew this time were sunnier, cheerful and seemed pleased to be onboard. Pushback was right on time and arrival 18 minutes early. Service consisted of the usual morning beverages and a stroopwaffel. A second round of coffees and a couple of water runs were done as well. All with a smile. This last flight was clearly the best of 3 I took with United over the last 10 days. Pity both the shorter international sectors I experienced were not quite up to scratch and felt more like domestic runs. One thing I find United has excelled at is it's mobile app. In terms of accessible information, actual usability and integrated entertainment - I think it exceeds the capabilities of most other airlines.";POSITIVE

Plane left on time and food served promptly after departure. Food quality was fairly good. Movies and IFE were also good. Service was prompt and attentive. Seat reclines flat and allows you to get a good sleep. In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told ""We're out of nuts."" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern. Possibly not as overly comfortable as some other airlines, though I slept very well on the way back. Wifi was good, when it worked! I have to say that I was generally happy overall. For a business class traveler on business, it did exactly what it needed to do.";POSITIVE

Only good experiences - both planes quite old but equipped with entertainment sets (short haul paid, long haul was free), with good variety of movies. Seats worn out but comfortable, enough legspace even for tall people. Food - nothing special, but acceptable. Most importantly - super quick and on time boarding, both planes took of on time and landed ahead of schedule. Last, but not least - super nice crew on both flights and in the ground. On top of all that - much cheaper than the competition. Recommended and will fly again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-10-08;"Newark to Panama City with United. We received a text from United as we arrived at Newark that the flight was delayed almost 3 hours due to late inbound aircraft as a result of weather and air traffic. I was concerned as it was clear now that we would not make our connection in Panama to Cartagena despite the 90 minute layover. Customer service at Newark reaffirmed the airline would not foot the bill for a hotel because of those reasons for delay. I had travel insurance so was not worried about that too much. Eventually took off and once onboard, crew were fine and reasonably friendly. They waived the DirectTV fee due to the delay. That was good except that once you're out of the Continental USA, your viewing selection is reduced to around 8 average movies you've probably already seen. No food except for a bag of pretzels, a couple of drinks and water runs for this 5 hour flight. New seats were fairly comfortable, sky interior, seat pitch was Ok, but cabin was hot for most of the flight. However, upon landing at Panama was very pleasantly surprised by the efficient ground staff who did in fact have hotel and meal vouchers, and our connecting flight for the next day, all ready and waiting. That was a huge plus. We did have to take our luggage out and recheck them the next morning for our onward trip on Copa.";POSITIVE

We were in seats 1A and 1B. The male flight attendant on this flight very obviously did not like his job - he never once smiled, never once said thank you, please, your welcome - it was if we were an inconvenience to this man.  I have never in all my years of travel, encountered a more surly flight attendant. Once we arrive to Chicago (we were on route to Toronto) we deplaned the aircraft and went in search of a board to see what our next gate would be - none were immediately available to us and we walked quite a way in terminal 1. I asked a United ground staff person how we get to Toronto and showed her my ticket, and she proceeded to send us to Terminal 5 - which is outside the security area and at the far end of the airport. This required taking the train, walking a fair distance, and once we arrived the ground staff at the entrance to this terminal advised us we needed to return to Terminal 1! Needless to say, we were not happy. Our flight was scheduled to depart 1 hour after we arrived at this airport (Chicago) and when we finally cleared security (again) and made our way back, the flight was already boarded and our overhead bins were full. And we were flying in seat 2b and 2d (I may have the seat numbers incorrect, but you get the idea - we were again in Business class.) This flight was a treat - the flight attendants were very pleasant, and had to deal with my ranting about being sent all over the airport by United ground staff. The flight was uneventful, but much better than the LA to Chicago route. United needs to get their people trained properly.

As if being displaced wasnt bad enough, United's ""policy"" will not allow me to change my departure city without paying the fare difference. Flying out of the same city early isn't an option because were being evacuated. Flying after the storm means I miss my sisters wedding.

The flight Newark - Los Angeles a full flight, but the flight attendants were there with good, cheerful service, with water, beverages, even a decent hot meal for purchase that was better than expected.

So, after the 4.5 hours of delay we were finally called to board. The flight was good, and we hoped to find that the flight in the evening got delayed so we didn't have to stay in an airport hotel and hop on the flight the next morning. So, we get to Newark and realize on the United app that our flight to SJO had taken off 2 min before we landed. We passed through security, which took 1 hour 20 min, we went to the counter and asked for a hotel room to spend the night and hop on the flight we had already been booked in for SJO the next morning. The whole flight was in there, trying to do the same as us, so we spent another 2 hrs shouting at the counter lady who didn't want to give us a room.

However, when we printed out our boarding pass the day before the flight, United had left my wife with the window seat but moved me about 25 yards back in the 5-seat section. We were shocked. There was no change of equipment, which might have explained it. No explanation, no apology. When we got to the airport, I said to the attendant at our gate that we chose our seats well in advance, so by rights those two seats together should be ours. She gave me a sly smile and said, in effect, ""No, you have no right to those seats. United retains the right to reassign seating for no reason or any reason, and that's what we've done."" Chalk it up to declining competition in the airline industry. With so few competitors, United feels they can treat their customers like pawns that they freely move around on the board at their whim. Last April we flew on United from Paris to Chicago non-stop. Once the doors were closed and the pilot taxiing to the runaway, the flight attendant said, in effect, ""You think we're flying non-stop from Paris to Chicago. We're not. We're flying from Paris to Newark where this flight will end."" The explanation: the pilot's maximum flying hours expired when we got to Newark. We were delayed many hours at Newark before they lined up a plane for us to take to Chicago. Again, passengers are just pawns.";NEGATIVE

I asked, ""Did I give you the right information?"". He looked annoyed and asked for our passports. As we left the counter, I doubled checked my boarding passes and only had three. Mine was missing. There were four in our party. I returned to the counter and told the employee I only had three. He said, ""I printed four."" Well, I only had three. He pulled up the info on the computer, went to click print and guess what? Only three came out again. And as before, my boarding pass was not one of them. If the printer, computer or staff member had made the mistake, they should up to it, instead of sternly telling that they had printed it. We went to our gate and waited for the boarding call.

But, that is not the airlines, it is the inconsiderate passengers, who drag over-sized bags, or too many bags onto the plane. The cabin crew remains helpful and courteous. How long would you last dealing with what you see on airplanes these days? I left a Samsung tablet in the seat packet. I figured that was gone. But no, the clean-up crew found it, and they called my cell phone: ""We have your tablet"". That says a lot. I am flying United, whenever I can.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-09-27;" |  My daughter and I flew to Heathrow from Lexington and our first flight via Chicago went well. Plane departed and arrived on time. Unfortunately, the next leg of the trip wasn't as good. We sat in the plane in the heat for over an our before the plane departed. Once we were in the air, I took off my shoes and unfortunately slipped on the plastic runner under my seat and broke my toe on the seat in front of me. I mentioned it to the flight attendant who said I could have a wheelchair waiting for me at the gate in Heathrow - I declined as I felt I needed to at least try to walk, this was the beginning of my vacation with my daughter. The next thing that happened was that my special food order (gluten free) wasn't available. They said they never got the order although I had specially made the order on-line before my flight. I had to make do with another meal and the same with breakfast. The exact same thing happened on my return flight to the U.S. even though I'd made sure the order was done on-line once again. On the return flight, the flight attendant went to first class to get me some fruit and cheese. The plane was so old and tattered (both ways), the bathroom had ashtrays inside. The entertainment was non-existent with a tiny screen on the seat in from about the size of two decks of cards. All of the movies started at the same time so we were unable to choose anything that hadn't already started. Even if I'd been able to choose something, it would have been impossible to hear as the plane was so loud that my ears were buzzing long after the flight. Everything was old and tattered. What has made me even more irritated is that I received an email asking me to rate my journey (both ways). I mentioned these things and haven't heard a word from United. The reason I've given this review three stars instead of one is that three of our four flights were reasonably on-time with no lost luggage.";NEGATIVE

All the flight attendants said was ""oh I'm sorry, I'll write it up."" I had to press the issue until I was given an alternative to getting my devices charged. The next thing was discovered when we landed in Houston, was that we was not going to make our connection to Memphis. So we was directed to customer service. We were given a later flight, but they failed to inform us that that flight was delayed as well. We found it out while on our way to our gate, by text message. They knew that that flight was delayed long before we got our flight rebooked. They allow flights to be booked too close together so there is no way the connection can be made. And they fail to inform people about delays until the last second. Then all they can say is ""I'm sorry"" So empty, so sad. Now if we do not comply with their rules and schedules, they can decline our flight, without refund. Now how is that fair? They can mess up in every way and nothing is done except to say ""I'm sorry."" Not a happy camper - all my plans have been changed due to United Airlines messing up.";NEGATIVE

Its a 3 hour flight and prior to boarding the gate agent reminded everyone to download the app before heading on board. Terminal has free wifi so it was slow to download but achievable, Once you have the app you could use the in-flight entertainment on your BYOD for free. There was movies and TV shows, limited choice but enough to fill the 3 hours in. Cabin crew were friendly with 2 drink services and one pre packet cookie. Like always flight was full and they asked for volunteers to check baggage first before stopping others. Gate agent was friendly and was given a exit row window seat. Nice bonus really.

My flight was cancelled after sitting on the plane for 2 hours (this is not that bad part), and I had to scramble to get a new ticket out to EWR. I was able to get an American Airlines flight out (through United customer service). For my return trip, somehow my ticket was cancelled and no one at United could help. I spent hours on the phone and all I got was ""sorry we cannot do anything to reissue the ticket, and you need to contact AA"". I spoke to about 5 separate people, who put me on hold for at least a half hour at a time. Finally I called AA, and they called United with me, to try to understand how it became an AA issue. All of a sudden, United figured out the problem (after another 45 minutes on hold with the AA staff).

Tracking the planes flight - it was coming from Providence, RI and would have been impossible to make the 1:20. They like to slow play the delays on you. One thing is that the App is very helpful keeping track of delays, cancellations and gate changes. Which is the only thing that is for sure. Boarded the plane and waited over an hour for pilots! No air con, no wash water in the toilets. Just the most poorly managed airline out there.

I was 8 hours early to my flight and when I got to my destination my baggage was not there. I filed a report and they told me that my luggage is still in San Francisco! I waited over 24 hours for them to bring me my luggage. I was told by phone that I could purchase a couple of things that I needed for a maximum of $100 dollars until my luggage arrives and that I would be reimbursed once I sent them a receipt of what I purchased (along with a couple of forms). I went ahead and bought a swimming suit and a shirt. All together my total was $65. It's been a month later and they haven't got back to me! I called them over 5 times and have emailed them with all the forms they wanted 4 times. If you need to call their 1800 number don't even bother, they are unhelpful and inturrupt you before you finish your sentence. Also my luggage was 56 pounds on the way back and they charged me $168 dollars for it. I get home and check my statement online and I notice that they charged me $168 twice instead of once. Overall this has been a vacation from hell. I encourage you to spend the extra money and fly with an airline that cares about their costumers. ";NEGATIVE

United never seems to be proactive to check their carry on bags, so a group of people typically has to deboard the plane to go up and check their bags. Usually they have two extremes where they check everyone's or no ones. Let's standardize, United. During this flight, people asked to check their bag and the boarding lady denied them, causing a big back up. She seemed clueless and new without any help. When I got on the plane after I checked my bag, people were still trying to leave the plane to check their bag. The flight attendant yelled at me to slide into a seat when I got to my row and already asked my seat mates if I could get to my window seat. The flight attendant then gave me a dirty look-exactly how I wanted to start my morning. I just hope my return flight leaves on time, which is only on time 40% of the time (source: United.com).

The attendant in Monterey did an amazing job rerouting my flight and giving me back up options. However, when I got to SFO, it was a different story. The connecting flight did not make it in on time so I needed to reschedule yet again. The staff member at the customer service desk was incredibly unprofessional. They were telling jokes and speaking in a different language on their cell phone while they were with customers, and we're just downright inattentive. The customer service in SFO was terrible.

I knew most US based airlines were not good from several past experiences, but this time United went far below any expectations. Boarded a plane that the crew knew had a problem, and had to unboard after they could not fix the problem. - This because these planes look old, worn out and not appealling, or reassuing to fly. - Had no certaintiy whether flight would be canceled or not until 3 hours after initial take off time. Got rerouted and was not given option to take earlier connection which had a 1h40 mns transit time. Instead, I was given a connection time in Heathrow of 4.5 hours! Little details like your meal choice cannot be satisfied as they do not board enough meals to give people a real choice. When I complained about this to the hostess, I got a cold answer: ""How would we do business if we board more meals than passengers to give everyone in business class a choice?"". I answered her back: ""well, may be you should ask all the other airlines I fly how they do it: European, Asian, Middle Eastern"". I have a senator status with Star alliance, supposed to be a valued customer. The worst airline experience - I highly discourage everyone from flying, and I obviously will never fly again.";NEGATIVE

The flight there was on-time, offered in-flight movies and shows and internet access for additional cost. I couldn't get the movies to work on my laptop, but after downloading their UA app it worked fine on my android. The flight had 2 complimentary drinks, ranging from water to random juices, and a little snack. You could buy additional drinks and food if you wanted, all prices were transparent and pretty fair. The main reason why I'm writing this review is because of my flight back. I ended up being on-time but because of the TSA check point I missed my flight. The flight left exactly when it had to, and it was my fault for not arriving earlier.  I called the UA phone, the lady found me a connecting flight through houston to NYC the following day. Free of charge, not the best option, but I'll take it. I ended up stopping by the front-desk so to speak of the UA before leaving the airport just to double-check. They lady at the desk found me a connecting flight that leaves in 20mins time, and because i'm a tall guy (6'4"") she even gave me isle seats! I ended up getting an economy plus isle seat to houston and a normal economy isle seat to NYC, which was sold out and overbooked, but I still got on. Anyway, I'm very happy. No charge, next-flight out, I ended up getting back home a day earlier than I technically should've, because of nice customer service!

We first waited 25 minutes outside in the dark to go through security due to the construction. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours. There were no seats at the gate since there were multiple United flights that were delayed. Later our gate was changed with no announcement from 74 to 72. When we asked an United employee at the first gate, she had no idea which gate was correct. It was finally determined gate 72 was the correct gate. When we went over to gate 72, there were no lights and they were completing construction with drilling, jack-hammering, and shouting right next to us. It was extremely loud, we were sitting in the dark, with no United employee in sight. Our flight, initially delayed to 1:15 am continued to get pushed back. When I went to use the restroom before our flight, the restrooms were disgusting. When an United employee finally came to our gate and I expressed my concern that not only were we severely delayed and sitting in the dark with an absurd noise level, but now there weren't even restroom facilities available, she told me there was nothing she could do and dismissed me. Due to United's delay, our arranged transportation home from the Newark airport had to be adjusted causing significant inconvenience.  I could not believe the lack of communication, unsanitary conditions, disorganization, and the complete lack of professionalism we experienced from United. It was the worst experience and a complete disgrace at the end of our honeymoon. ";NEGATIVE

She also said that the only seats available are middle seats. It is the first time something like this happened to me and I was really shocked, especially when buying the ticket I requested for a window seat.

On August 30th I get an automated email saying that my flight is scheduled as planned. I noticed that they had the wrong time of flight in the email. So, I went online and verified the correct flight time (a flight at the time they sent me didn't exist). When I arrived at the airport and began the check-in process there was no record of me in the system. The kiosks gave me ""not found"" and the personnel at the counters confirmed the same. My flight was in two hours and I was starting to panic. I called United Airlines and got an agent. I explained my situation, told the agent that it was urgent and I was about to miss my flight, and asked if I could speak to a supervisor. The agent put me on a very long hold and then disconnected me. After a number of similar calls to the call center I finally got an agent - an hour later - that told me that somebody at UA had deleted my record from the system on the morning of my flight and I no longer had a seat on that plane. Really UA? Wow. Given the number of long holds, disconnects, and agents not able to correctly diagnose and resolve the problem from the start, I missed my flight. I had to take a later flight that day which made a mess of my plans. I will not use United Airlines again. It bends my mind that an airline could simply remove a paying customer from a confirmed flight without notification and leave him to sort out the mess at check-in. A mess that was met, not with any apologies or concern for my predicament, but with endless hold times, disconnects, and supervisors that are ""too busy at the moment"".

I approached the counter and told the woman of my concerns, if there was a flight I could catch sooner, fly to a different hub, etc. she said I would be fine. My reply was that if the flight was delayed even 1 more minute I would miss my connection. 4 hours later were supposed to start boarding and I get a new notification saying my flight was delayed another hour. I was going to miss my connection. I approached the desk, there were now no more flights that could get me to my destination, none even in the same state as my destination! So I had to rebook for two days later. I wasted my PTO of two days, shortening my vacation, wasted money on cab fares to and from my house and back for my next flight, they don't reimburse and just frustration that they couldn't be proactive in the situation to find a solution. So here I am two days later, didn't get to choose my seat, I'm checking in and notice there are aisle seats further up than mine that are open and I ask the woman at the desk to please change my seat. She said to do that at the gate. By the time I got through security and up to the gate all those seats were gone. More frustration. One small change could have improved today but the lack of care and sense of urgency from the United team has made my respect for the company vanish.

They refused to return my checked luggage to me which I needed, and assured me it would be on my flight the next day. When we were on the flight the next day going to Halifax, we paid the fee to rent a movie, as United Airlines does not provide free movies like other airlines. We then found out that even if you pay you cannot start at the beginning of the movie, you start wherever the movie is at, as they run on a repeating cycle. Therefore we accidentally watched the last 5 minutes of the movie we paid to see. Also want to mention that of the four planes taken on this trip only one had a TV which was not free. Two of these flights were two hours long and two were five hours long. United Airlines also advertises free wifi on the plane, which doesn't work.

united-airlines;2016-08-22;" |  Washington to Barcelona with United. It is generally true for United that things were better in pre-Continental merger but it all ain't that bad either. I have flown the B767-400ER and B777 on several transatlantic routes this summer in both classes. I was surprised at how much more comfortable the B764 was as compared to the B777. The B777 felt packed (3-3-3 configuration in coach and awkward backward facing seats in business), while the B764 felt very spacious, clean and modern (2-3-2 in coach and 2-1-2 in business, all forward facing and not too many seats, so quieter). There were also no bothersome IFE equipment boxes under the window seats in coach. I would recommend searching routes that operate the B764 over the B777 - I really believe it is superior in terms of cabin layout and passenger comfort. BusinessFirst very comfortable flat bed seats (I am 179cm). Food quality ok, the main course was very good (beef with steamed vegetables) as well as the cheese and desert (nice detail they cut the cheese at your seat, so it feels fresh). The starter salad was very uncreative and plain bad actually, and no olive oil option as a dressing. But OK, it's an US airline so just don't expect any proper food to come out of that. Food in coach was also good with 3 separate serving rounds for appetiser, meal and desert+coffee. Great idea to hand out water bottles before the sleeping phase of the flight. Next time I will opt for the express dining option in business, as the full dining service takes so much time that you have little left for sleeping. Some people argue the seat configuration in business should be 1-2-1 rather than 2-1-2, but I disagree, while 1-2-1 is perfect for solo business travelers as everyone has isle access, I feel that when traveling with my partner (or any other person) I want to sit together by the window, so 2-1-2 does make sense to me.

I have clearly indicated that my mileage are to be credited to Kris Flyer account and it is printed on my boarding pass.

Having flown for a number of years on this route I can actually compare. I am shocked, disappointed and extremely angry by the customer service provided on the ground. Flights delayed (no shock there, we were at Newark) but the inability for ground staff to give any information. Then we come to the actual flight. When I see these advertisements on T.V I am beyond frustrated. We pay a huge chunk of money to fly transatlantic and get put on planes that are old. No space. and we then pay this huge amount of money to feel like sardines in a can. We are lucky to be treated like people, spoken to like idiots, and then have to watch a fantastic safety video (on a screen that probably doesn't work), which also cost millions to make. We are then told that all these changes make our flying lives more comfortable. Tired, disappointed and supremely angry. Unless I have no choice, I never want to fly United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-08-21;" |  Washington to Amsterdam. This was one of my leisure travels where I was traveling with family and a younger sibling. BusinessFirst"" does consist of nice lie flat beds, you can lie flat and sleep for the most part. as well as the meals being consistently nice. This is something that I can say that United has done well over the past few years. As for the negatives. The businessfirst cabin is cramped.  Cram as many people together as close together to the point you can't but help to stare at your neighbors. Economy plus has a little bit more legroom but hardly worth the extra money if you have to pay for it. This older 767 has dated IFE, screens that are 4 inches wide and may you be lucky if they work. Seats in Econ+ are old, and often broken and hindered in legroom by the IFE boxes. That being said there is extreme value in the price of a UA ticket. The tickets are often $200 cheaper than competing airlines. Furthermore the cabins are grungy, dirty and not clean. You notice a felling of stale air and dirt the second you come into the cabin. I flew with my sibling who is a minor, very much a minor as he is still in elementary school. He was booked in United Economy on an award ticket, I in United Businessfirst paid. I asked the United Agents at checkin if he could sit with me in the business cabin as there where plenty of seats in the cabin still available. I was declined  because of the ""scarcity"" of meals  and asked once again when boarded if he could take an empty seat. The purser was kind enough to ask and with some humiliation, when I pressed him for an answer, he answered that there were not enough seats. As for experience onboard with the staff, it can vary 50/50. Staff are usually quite friendly in the business cabin. but this can also be a polar opposite with glaring stares, cold shoulder treatment and curt responses. Delays on United are not a surprise, they are the rule. I have missed countless engagements, meetings etc because of United's inability to stick to schedule. Again this flight was no different. We boarded, and were advised there was a faulty fresh water valve failure. We were on board for 1 hour before the pursers and FAs advised us to deplane and wait outside whilst they resolved the issue or found a resolution. I went to sit in the Global First Lounge - every other lounge that I've been to is nicer - to await the resolution. Another 3 hours progresses before we are able to board another plane (aircraft swap) to continue on our way to Amsterdam. Albeit this isn't the most disappointing trip I've made with United, the narrative does become a golden rule to flying with United. Hope this helps others make informed choice.";NEGATIVE

Inbound flight in Boeing 777 with ptv which also didn't work for the first hour. Promised wifi didn't work at all. Mainly UK based rather cold crew. Food and drinks again okay. Both flights punctual.

united-airlines;2016-08-19;" |  My wife and I just returned from a trip to Portugal that started at Newark Airport on August 6th. We have never experienced such a bad quality of service. After boarding a plane and been ready to take off at 8:25 pm, we had the announcement informing us that we had to go back to the gate due to a computer problem in order for the technicians to fix it. After getting the OK from maintenance, the plane was pushed back, but it stopped a few moments later. After another 30 minutes waiting, we got the announcement from the cabin telling us that the plane had to go back to the terminal because of the same problem. Back at the gate we were told to disembark and take all our belongings because it would take at least a couple of hours to fix the problem. A few minutes later the crew starts leaving the plane and we asked why? The lady says: nobody told you yet? The plane is only leaving at 7:00 am because the crew already used the hours and the pilot can't fly the plane. Then the announcement comes from the counter, but they also tell us that there are no hotels in the area to take everybody, so we will have to stay in the terminal.  What about food? A $10 voucher when a sandwich costs $9:99. The night was over. Let's board again and be on the way to Lisbon. We had to wait for another 2 hours, in the plane, for the paperwork from maintenance to clear the work that had been done overnight. We finally took off at 9:30 am, 12 hours later. Just out of curiosity: United claims to be one of the biggest airlines and doesn't have another plane and a crew on standby to respond to this kind of situations? We didn't see one single supervisor in 12 hours.";NEGATIVE

The staff that greeted us were very polite and pointed us towards our seats. The plane did not have any monitors but was fittied with wifi. Only issue with the wifi is that it doesn't work over the pacific so doesn't matter. This isn't United's fault but with the wifi provider. There was no food offered on this flight but got the stroopwafel and drinks. I love the waffel so I didn't complain and asked for one more. We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United. Hawiian Airlines does offer food from LA to HNL so I wish that was offered. Other than that United has been trying hard to please their customers and I think they are headed in the right direction.";POSITIVE

Although there was not a lot of attention between meal services, there were always staff walking around. Water was given out from time to time. In other words, a perfectly adequate experience, but not stellar by any standard. The 8-across configuration is so yesterday. There is virtually no privacy and the seats. though comfortable are not generously sized at all. United Business/First is just not up to the standards set by most non-American carriers.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-08-18;" |  My wife and I have just returned from a trip to the USA (Newark to Sydney via San Francisco) flying United Airlines business class. We’ve flown a lot over the years but have never experienced an airline service quite as bad as this one. After a long flight from Sydney we faced a 6-hour delay in San Francisco awaiting a connection to Chicago. At one point we boarded a plane and were preparing for take-off. The plane was actually waiting on the runway for the go ahead to fly. Astoundingly, we get a cabin announcement informing us that we were to be taken back to the terminal as the pilot had gone over his assigned ‘flight hours’ and couldn’t fly the plane. You couldn’t make this stuff up. Confusion reigned for the next few hours while United staff gave conflicting information. Firstly, we were told to stay on the plane and wait for a replacement pilot. We were then told we’d need to disembark. One said we'd definitely be flying that day while another said we might not as they might not be able to get a pilot. Eventually, a pilot did arrive and we did fly out that day. Unfortunately, the return leg didn’t improve. We were scheduled to fly from Newark airport to San Fran where we would catch another flight to Sydney. As time was tight between when the flight from Newark was due to arrive and our connection from San Fran was due to depart, we decided to arrive at Newark airport early to see if we could change to an earlier flight. We were told by a rather surly United staff member that all earlier flights were fully booked. Strangely – when I checked my baggage in, the check in screen told me that for $75.00 I could take an earlier flight. After passing security, we decided to go to the United lounge and ask service staff about any other options for taking an earlier flight. When staff saw the tight connection time between the two flights they were in disbelief. They told us that this was an illegal connection and we should not have been able to even book it. They then offered to put us on standby and as it happened, we were able to get an earlier flight. On arrival at San Fran, my wife noted that an email had been sent to her from her work. When we hadn’t boarded our ‘booked’ flight from Newark our flight from San Francisco to Sydney had been cancelled. Service staff confirmed this and notified that our booked seats had already been sold and we might not be able to get seats on the flight. We were eventually assigned new seats but we might as well have saved our money and gone economy. Passengers were walking through the cabin all night and we had to put up with a screaming baby and the stench of diaper changes. The service was woeful and I’ve had better in economy on other airlines. Our seats hadn’t been cleaned properly - there was rubbish and the screen control device was so sticky and dirty my wife had to wipe it down herself. Finally, when we arrived in Sydney we went to the baggage claim. After waiting an hour for our baggage we decided to check where it might be. Surprise, our baggage was still in San Fran. This despite asking United staff numerous times that our luggage was on the flights and receiving their full assurances. The service person in Sydney noted it was a common occurrence with United. When we turned around there was a line of United customers with the same issue. I realise others have had far worse flight experience, but ours wasn’t great. You come away with the feeling that the dollar is definitely a priority over the customer.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-08-17;" |  Another huge disappointment with United. I was traveling to Sao Paulo on August 13th. I understand weather related issues and the 1 hr delay but once again the communication with United is just terrible and don’t get me started on the attitude from the United personnel. They kept us on the plane for more than 1 hour because they couldn’t move the gate bridge and maintenance was working on it. After weather and Gate Bridge delays, we left 140 minutes late but the problem is that 40 minutes after takeoff, pilot announcement was extremely disconcerting. “Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a problem because we are getting some warning signs and the Autopilot doesn’t work so we will have to get back to the closest mayor airport but we will not declare any emergency”. Once again having problems, I don’t know if it’s just me that I travel too much or just bad luck. Unfortunately I have had more and more issues with United and for once I realize status doesn’t mean anything as some United representatives are rude and disrespectful and they can’t resolve problems. I guess I didn’t get any compensation because I decided to cancel my trip as I was only going to be in Brazil for 36 hrs after all of this issue. I had 3 customers by themselves in Brazil and this was really costly to the company but I guess United doesn’t really care about it. If this was a onetime thing, from time to time, it would be fine, but its almost every international overseas flight a take (7-8 a year) and then, several domestics as well. ";NEGATIVE

This airline is uniformly dire and I question why Air NZ places its passengers on this carrier if not for Star Alliance. In same league as Air China, which is also Star Alliance. On the plus side, my bags made it from NZ to Ottawa. Now for the negatives: overbooked cramped flights (offered usd 400 and usd 150 on both flights to take later flight - no thanks). Service with a snarl. Thanks to unexplained delays at Newark, my trip became 26 hr ordeal rather than a 23 hr ordeal. Zero service on the late night flight to Ottawa (like I said, just glad my bags arrived). Star Alliance should enforce minimum quality standards amongst ifs members.

They overbooked the first flight by 19 people and even though I was in group 2 for boarding did not give me a seat number forcing me to be the last on the plane and making me check my bag due to there being no storage space. Once we arrived in Chicago we were out on a very old dated plane with torn seats. We they say for hours as they tried to out safety signs onto one of the doors. They for some reason did not have these signs and stickers in stock so they had to manufacture them. Completely unacceptable.

This was the cheapest option for my trip, and had the best connection times. On the way down to Honduras, there was no issues except that the personal in-flight entertainment wasn't working for some of the flight down to Houston, which wasn't a big deal because I brought myself plenty of things to do. Both the flights from Denver and Houston left on time, and the flight from Denver arrived a little early. Coming back wasn't quite as smooth. I checked in online and printed boarding passes from the hotel's computer rather than doing it at the airport. However, the airport staff in San Pedro Sula wanted the version printed from the airport (not United's fault). What my biggest gripe is that once I get to the ticket counter, I am rudely told that since I already have a boarding pass, they can't print me another one. Luckily, I was able to eventually get to the secure part of the airport. Then when I am trying to board, the ground service rejects the boarding pass which I printed off of the United website, and almost wouldn't let me board. After a few minutes of verification, they finally let me board, but first give me a lecture about ""not having a boarding pass"". Overall, all the flights were fine. The cabin crew were all very friendly, and since I have the United App, I could access the personal entertainment, which had a good selection of movies. They offered drinks, and the service was done very quickly. The legroom was a little tight, but the seats themselves were comfortable and the airplane was clean. With the exception of ground service in San Pedro Sula, I was satisfied with the airline. I may consider using them in the future.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2016-08-06;"Took my sister on her very first flight to visit my brother in Maine. Booked a flight on United Airlines and expected this flight to be no different than all the many other flights I have taken, but never with United. It was not only the worst flight I have ever had, it was a total nightmare! We left Austin, TX on time no problem. Arrived at O'Hare and the was the last of what was supposed to be a positive experience for my sister. When we arrived we proceeded to our departing gate, C7. No one ever came to inform us that the flight had been delayed. I go to a customer service desk, leaving my sister to watch our carry ons. Our flight was to depart at 7:20pm, it was 7:00. By the time I reached the customer service area the line was snaked around and way down the hall way. I stood in line for 4 hours! When I get to the front I was then informed that our flight had been canceled and we would be on stand by for the next available flight to Maine. When I asked when that may be she rudely told me that it will not be tonight but tomorrow morning. When I asked her what we were supposed to do she gave me a voucher for a discount to a hotel, but we would have to be back at the airport by 4:30am to be on stand by. Why bother going to a hotel? We would only get about two hours of sleep if that. They didn't even offer blankets or pillows! When we finally were informed that we would be called for the next flight I found out that only one of us would be called. I told them that we were together and we will not be separated - that was not what I paid for! My sister was terrified that we would end up on separate flights! Acting like we were severely inconveniencing him he told us to take a seat and wait. We finally were called and boarded, but in separate seats.  Needless to say, this was not a very good experience for my sister and I was beyond upset. When I called the next day to change return flights for a day later, again I was made to feel like I was being an inconvenience.

More annoying however, the 3-4 hr flights are without infotainment, except the one you pay via WIFI. Considering that UA dropped me and many others, on connecting flights that commence boarding 5-10 minutes before landing, it is obvious that you have no time whatsoever to charge devices - not if going from UA to UA flight. Besides the lack of USB or any other ports, they want you to download their own apps and software, and hopefully be sucked into an UA wifi spending spree. Food? What food?

I said that was no problem and they gave me a departure time and flight number. I got off the phone relieved that I was able to get a flight for him at the correct time. Some time later I realized that I had not been asked for any payment information. That couldn't be right so I called customer service back and spoke with an agent who assured me that the flight was confirmed and paid for. I repeated to her that I was supposed to be charged $200. She said somebody must've made a mistake and I got lucky. I was told I would receive confirmation by email. Over an hour passed and no email. Called customer service again. I was told that they didn't know why I didn't get the email and again assured me that everything was confirmed. Next morning we drove over an hour from Colorado Springs to the Denver airport. I dropped him off and went back to my hotel in Colorado Springs. About 4 hours later I got a call from my friend. There were no flights confirmed! No one had any idea what he was talking about or how that could possibly have happened.

Of the 6 legs on a round trip flight, 5 were more than 2 hours late, crews and airport personel were rude and uncaring, this last flight from SFO to MRY was delayed 3 times and then cancelled at 1am leaving us stranded in SFO. The customer service reps said the most they could do was see if they could get some blankets for everyone, no refunds, no bus to get us home, no vouchers, nothing, most people ended up renting cars and driving to the destination. The explanation was 'weather', they gave this standing in front of a Doppler radar map showing no clouds or weather anywhere in the west and the plane was supposed to be coming from Burbank. People in line checked weather apps for Burbank, SFO and Monterey, it was clear and beautiful in all those places and everywhere in between. They use weather as the excuse so they don't have to refund the tickets because it's beyond their control. United employees are so rude it's obvious that they are unhappy and tired of lying to passengers. Staff onboard stood chatting in the galley and are rude to passengers, no please, thank you, etc. Won't take this airline again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-07-22;" |  I have flown United Airlines several times, and they have shown incredible consistency in being the absolutely worst airline. My negative experiences with the airline date back to 2007. As for the present trip under review from New York LaGuardia to Chicago, here are the most relevant issues. First, the flight was delayed leaving the airport by over two hours. There was no explanation given for what led to the delay while we waited at the gate. Second, the space between seats is simply unfairly small. I am a 5' 10"" man who is not at all overweight. And yet, my knees were pressed firmly against the seat in front of me, and the space was so small that I could not open my laptop computer to do work on the flight (my laptop is a MacBook Air, the thinnest model). Third, once in Chicago airspace we were told we could not land and circled the airport for close to an hour. When it finally appeared that we were going to land, the landing was aborted at the very last moment and were re-routed to Detroit. The problem: no information was given that we were heading there, just a little surprise when we arrived at a different airport. Upon exiting the plane, there were no gate agents there to help with booking connecting flights, only the personnel who dealt with lost luggage. I could actually say more negative things about this flight but am limited by space. Suffice it to say that I will absolutely never fly United again unless they are literally the only option in getting to my destination city. I would happily pay double to avoid getting on a United flight.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-07-22;"I have been flying United Airlines very often from MBS (Saginaw) to ORD and back. Recently since a new company took over the previous ground handling it has been terrible. I have only flown 3 times in the past 3 weeks. The agents at the counter don't help with much at all. The ground handling is very slow. At a small airport like MBS with 3 united flights a day, you should not have to wait for ramp staff to come outside and meet the plane. The previous company AirWis had some of the greatest agents I have ever met and were always very respectful and good at their jobs. The new people need some more workers working a flight at a time so they can turn one on time also. ";NEGATIVE

It turned out that economy plus on United Airlines is a scam to make you pay more money for very little else. We ended up having to pay for checking in bags, the seats were uncomfortable and the added 'leg room' was laughable. I had some box under the seat in front of me that meant i had to move my feet to the left for the flight, very uncomfortable. Staff on the flight were not interested in the economy plus / economy cattle behind the curtain and I was told a flat no when i asked if they had a spare blanket for my son who was freezing. I would never fly United Airlines again, save your money and book another airline that have genuine perks and benefits for your money.";NEGATIVE

Thus led to high expectations which were not met at all. After an efficient boarding process the first disappointments. The cabin made an outdated impression and signs of abrasion were found everywhere. cables fixed with tape, worn armrests and not working lights were just a few of them. The cabin staff was split half-in-half: 50 per cent were very friendly and seemed to care about passengers, however, the other half behaved like their job is a tremendous burden for them and customers seen as a factor of distress. The selection of food found in the menu was good but the quality of the served meals was bluntly put an impertinence. especially the meat was flavourless and rubber-like. The beverages were much better, though the coffee was another letdown. On the positve side, the IFE was very easy to handle and the provided films, games, and music covering a broad palette of tastes. In addition, the price-performance-ratio was straight. Overall it can be stated that there is a lot of space for improvement.";NEGATIVE

Communication about gate changes and the delay could have been much better, but once we boarded the plane the staff were fantastic. The only thing that let down the whole experience was the food at Newark International Airport. It is disgusting and this is from someone who will eat anything and not complain. We had heard it was bad but did not believe it, believe everything you hear and eat before you arrive. The only saving grace is that there is a Starbucks, which is about the worst I have been to all over the world, but better than anything else we found in the six hours we spent at this airport.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-07-19;" | Flew with United from Denver to Kansai via San Francisco, or at least that was the plan. Before I start, I should mention that I am still a minor, with limited cash on hand and no credit card. I was and still am a relatively high-ranking frequent flyer member with Star Alliance, and this trip was bought with those miles. Straight off the bat my flight was delayed by 2 hours in Denver. There was no explanation as to why it was delayed, but I was directed to the customer service at Denver. There, I was told that I would miss my initial connecting flight that was supposed to take me directly to Kansai, but I could still take my delayed flight out of Denver to catch a flight from SFO to HND, where they would then put me on a flight from HND to KIX. That wasn't ideal, but was better than nothing so I took the offer and left Denver. When I arrived at SFO I was now told that I could not take the flight to HND, because the plane was flown by ANA, not UA. All they tell me is that there is nothing they can do. In the end, their alternative is for me to fly out on a 7:45pm flight from SFO, and then to fly out from HND to KIX at 8am next day. In total they made me wait 7 hrs in SFO and 10hrs in HND. I asked them to book a hotel at HND to spend the night, and all they would tell me is that I should do that at the UA counter in HND, but surprise, surprise the counter at HND was closed as HND is not a 24hr airport and I landed at 10:35pm local time. I ended up having to walk and take buses around HND at midnight. Calling hotels while carrying 4 bags for 2 hours trying to find a hotel that was open. I barley had enough money to pay for the night, and UA wouldn't reimburse me because “I went and booked it myself, not through UA.” If this had been someone that didn't speak Japanese, this probably would have been a far worse experience for them.";NEGATIVE

The United ground staff at Dulles are rude, one staff member in the check in area started shouting to us to move. Good thing that the flight attendants were very sweet and cordial. The worst of all is that our plane was supposed to depart at 5:15 we depart at 7:30 - 2 hours of delay! ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-07-17;" |  Chicago to Sao Paulo. I fly United a lot, because I live in Chicago and have the opportunity to collect miles and other benefits. Generally, I've been satisfied with this arrangement. I'm not unrealistic about United - you definitely don't get the small luxuries that Asian and some European airlines provide, but United generally provides competent, reliable service, and most staff members are reasonably friendly. Recent flights to and from GRU were par for the course. The flights were on time. Staff were efficient. The economy plus seats were fine. The small screens on the 767s are pretty bad, but I understand why it might not be worth updating them. I don't eat meat and have learned that ""Asian vegetarian"" tends to be better quality than regular vegetarian. The ""Asian vegetarian"" suppers were reasonable in both directions, although there was nothing at all Asian about the GRU to ORD supper (soy burgers plus rice and vegetables). The ORD to GRU supper was quite good and (except maybe for the curried tofu) quite South Asian. It even came with plain yogurt. However, United should be embarrassed by the breakfasts (in both directions), which consisted entirely of a stale roll and a tiny package of jam. People who didn't request a special meal got a croissant and a sweetened yogurt, which would have been just as ""Asian vegetarian"" as what I did get. My seatmate who (unlike me) is actually South Asian was just furious. This is the sort of thing that undermines United's improving reputation. Asian and most European airlines are much more generous about breakfasts and usually provide vegetarians (and everyone else) with a full meal. Let me add that I complained about the breakfast on the GRU to ORD flight to an FA as gently as I could, and she very nicely supplied me with a regular breakfast. I urged my seatmate to do the same, and he just got angrier. I appreciated the reasonable-quality wine that United is now distributing for free in economy.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2016-07-06;"Washington IAD to San Francisco and then 4 days later from San Francisco to Paris CDG with United. Both long flights, I was in economy, both times with priority boarding and in a window or aisle seat, which is important to me. I get priority with my Chase United credit card, I bought a package that included Premiere Access to check in with priority boarding for the flight to Paris, and I was glad I did, because I thereby avoided the mob of people at SFO waiting for access to the check in machines. Both of my seats were quite comfortable, I did not feel cramped. I am just under 6 feet tall and quite thin. I bought access to back of the seat entertainment on the IAD to SFO flight in advance at a slight discount, it was free on the Paris flight. I did not buy any food on the domestic US flight, but United has started handing out tiny little bags of savory snacks on their US flights, which is quite new. The food on the Paris flight was not a gourmet treat by any means, but it was OK. There was free wine or beer on that flight too, another new thing. Both of the flights departed and arrived on time, and delivered my luggage at my destination. Flight attendants were pleasant. So not a luxurious experience but an efficient one that did what I paid them to do. I think people tend to write reviews when they are infuriated by a terrible experience or delighted by a superlative one. So I thought I would even things out a bit by a review of United that says ""it was fine"". ";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-07-05;" |  Flew United Airlines, first class from Los Angeles - Chicago and return. Service was appalling, other than the wider seat, it may as well have been a coach trip. Shortly after take off, I asked one of the flight attendants for a second serving of nuts, to my shock, she said (actually ""snipped"" was more like it) ""no, we have only one serving per person"". For a first class ticket, you can't get a second thimble of nuts? When lunch was served, it seemed like it took forever,  two or three passengers were served after which there were long intervals before the next few passengers were served. There were those who were finishing before we'd even started. As to the preparation - there was not even an attempt to cover the fold up trays with a linen of any kind and the food was not good - unappetizing coach grade cafeteria fare. Internet in both directions was available for a charge - something like $3.99/hour. This, I've never heard of especially in first class. Nonetheless, I paid for the entire flight and could not get it to work in either direction. $20.00 wasted. The condition of the plane felt ok, solid and relatively new - though the electric plug at my seat was loose, and wouldn't hold a cord, the entire socket tipped out with the weight of the electric cord so that was unusable as well. The only redeeming value on the flight were the more comfortable seatings and the fact that the pilot seemed experienced. My question on this flight: other than the more comfortable seats - what did I pay for? This was a very poor excuse for what was supposed to be a first class flight. ";NEGATIVE

I even had to pay for a Gin and Tonic in the ""Club"" Lounge, which was more full and far dirtier than the main airport. Never again.

It was clean and tidy, if standard United look and feel. Cabin crew were very pleasant on this empty flight. Departure was right on time. Good selection of films to pass the 8 hour + journey. Smooth flight. Flight deck kept us informed of progress. Food was very basic and not much of it. Mid flight ice cream and a pre-landing hot sandwich. WIFI did not work at all. Immigration, baggage claim, and onto Manhattan in 20 minutes after deplaning.

Both the outgoing and returning aircraft were newer, departed on time and arrived early in each instance. My review is going to focus solely on the support staff in the terminal, prior to security screening. My family arrived at Seatac airport roughly an hour and a half prior to our 6.19am flight. We checked our first bag, then attempted to check a car seat at the United Airlines terminal. It took them damned near a half hour to check a single car seat. What would have been ample time to make a flight had been cut by a third to do something that should have taken 5 minutes. Now for Newark. Same issue with checking the car seat, except the customer service specialist that walks up and down the check-in area, who's job it is to assist customers with their trouble checking in and checking bags, practically ignored me until I had said ""Ma'm"" about 5 or 6 times. At which point she gave me a ""Why are you bothering me"" look and continued walking.

We get to Houston and they have no outgoing flights at night so we have no way to leave until 8:45 am the next morning but they won't put us up for a night because according to them it isn't ""their problem, they cannot control the weather!""  We spent the night in an airport that was locked down, no food or restaurant open except for some sandwich shop and we hadn't ate since 9 this morning because we should have been home hours ago. Horrible customer service! The lady at our gate called for back up to help at least five times and not one person came.

In fact the pilot showed up and was as baffled as the passengers. I was supposed to land in Norfolk around 2122 hrs but did not land until after midnight. As a result the rental car company and I was forced to rent a car from another company. To add insult to injury the luggage was delayed coming off the plane. There was no one else at the airport so why the luggage would be delayed on top of the everything else is beyond me. Luggage and additional car rental fees aside, the delay impacted the amount of time I could spend with my family. The return trip was no better. I was delayed out of Norfolk with no communication letting me know of the delay. I was also delayed in Newark New Jersey. They had a plane with no crew. I was supposed to be back in Cincinnati by 1555 hrs. on Friday June 24. In actuality, I did not get back until 1940 hrs. To add injury to insult my luggage was on a separate flight which did not land until 2040 hrs.

I left Tampa around noon, and didn't get in to NYC until 2 in the morning the next day. On top of that, they managed to lose my luggage, and they still haven't found it after a day.

Many of these delays are mechanical or personnel in nature (awaiting pilot or crew). Obviously, when you are so heavily invested with an airline, they've got you.

Having read many negative reviews and horror stories of United Airlines, I went in with lowered expectations. The flights overall turned out okay, even though it was eventful and I did encounter problems like flight diversion and flight and baggage delays. First, UA6. The personal screen on the 772 was touchscreen and not very big. The touchscreen was not sensitive, and the system was not very user-friendly. That said, they have a decent repertoire of entertainment, even though they may not always be the latest (e.g. movies). The food turned out better than I expected, but this assumes you made the right choices (on my return flight, to be separately reviewed, I made the wrong choices). First meal (dinner) was chicken with rice, second meal (breakfast) was chicken and egg with rice, Japanese style. Both were actually good. Ice cream (vanilla) was served after the first meal, and in between the 12-hour flight they served drinks and also a burger. However, only the salad was horrible - edamame beans should not be served as a salad. Service was decent too - remember, if you are nice to the flight attendant (e.g. you are polite to them), they will also be nice to you. Seat was reasonably comfortable too. Unfortunately for this flight, bad weather at Houston caused us to divert to Austin, where we waited on the tarmac to refuel, and some snacks were distributed while waiting. This caused us to land at Houston eventually 3 hours late - and we thought we missed our connecting flight. Next, UA1461. We thought we would miss this flight, which was due to depart almost 3 hours after UA6 was supposed to land (If it was on time) at Houston. However this flight was also delayed, so we managed to rush on despite arriving late and being caught in security checks and waiting for baggage which did not arrive on the belt. Not the airline's fault, but do check with Houston airport staff if your baggage needs to be collected at the luggage belt at Houston to be re-checked, because ours didn't need to be but we did not know. This flight was on a newer 738, but no in-flight entertainment. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a pasta, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). Flight was delayed presumably by bad weather at Houston, but also because they were slow with loading the luggage (I could see from my window they were still loading the luggage even past the departure time). In the end, unfortunately my luggage did not make it from my delayed UA6 to my delayed UA1461, and I had to proceed to their airport staff at San Salvador airport to lodge a case. I have to give them credit for being rather efficient in locating my luggage, putting it on the next flight that night, and delivering it to me the next day by noon - this whole process could have gone much worse, so I am glad it was well-handled. Overall, UA did not turn out as bad as I had expected it to be for my first time, even though I did experience my first diversion and delayed luggage, despite having flown regularly for many years with other airlines.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-06-20;"UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner. ";POSITIVE

So not having flown with United Airlines for a while but flown quite a few others, I was a bit let down with the entertainment system. Tiny screen about the area of a large cellphone but without the picture quality. So the announcement comes when I'm sat down that you can use their app to stream it from airplane wi-fi to your tablet. Excellent, my tablet has a great screen, I just have to download a 60mb app before we take off. 4G drops and it chugs along but I get the app before we take off. The app works fine but United, please, if you offer wifi streaming because you scrimped on the seatback screens it's tight-arsed in the extreme to not offer any method of charging the damn device like a USB port.";NEGATIVE

I missed that flight. The next flight gets in at 2am. So I opted to just fly home and forgo my trip. It was a hell of a day. To top it off, my parents were stranded in Japan overnight when they flew with United. My whole in-law family got stranded in Italy for overnight this past summer with United.

When we boarded the plane, the jet bridge was fairly empty, and we walked onto the plane very quickly. When we got onto the jet, the cabin crew were nice and welcoming. The aisles on the plane were fairly crowded, but it took a short amount of time to get to our seats in the back of the plane. When we sat down, the seat was pretty comfortable. However, the seat cushion moved a little bit, because of the life vest underneath, but it was barely noticeable. The takeoff was pretty smooth, and after a few minutes we were at cruising altitude. The first drink/snack service came out about 1 hour into the flight. After the snack, I turned on the inflight entertainment system. There were a handful of movies to watch on the system and there were games you could play with other passengers on the flight. After the second snack service came out, we were approaching EWR. The landing was very smooth, and we were at the gate 5 minutes after landing.";POSITIVE

On our way back to Portland we are being delayed again due to mechanical issues and our barely booked flight has now turned into fully booked due to combining another flight going to portland due to mechanical issues.

I did not like the method for the WiFi connection. I had to pay an additional charge just to receive a video and still no Internet connection. The use of my own device and no way to maintain power.

united-airlines;2016-06-11;" |  Quite simply the worst in cabin service in the industry. Catering - meagre, mean, and distributed across the flight in a way that makes no sense and leaves you wondering who from United has actually been involved in this experience. 14.5 hour flight from Melbourne to Orlando via Los Angeles - 1st service less than an hour into the flight - a tiny main meal at 10.30 am in the morning. Eat it because you will be waiting another 12/13 hours before you will see any more food, and when that finally comes - look at what is delivered - a bread roll and an egg frittata. I thought I would distract myself with movies and TV but no, the entertainment system was not working - so was hungry and bored for 8 hours. The actual aircraft was nearly brand new and was terrific - a pity the only variables that United have to differentiate themselves with are all to the negative. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-06-09;"Montreal to Mexico via Newark. I was not looking forward to flying United Airlines but was positively surprised in many aspects. The flight out of Montreal departed on time. The small Embraer was in very good condition and the short service and snacks was enough for this short flight. Connecting through EWR from Canada is not an issue as immigration is pre-cleared, so I headed directly to the lounge. The food offerings are not that great and the lounge is crowded, but drink variety is good, lounge is clean and service very good. I have mixed feeling for the second leg of the trip: the plane was not very new, but it was clean and well maintained. Cabin crew were very friendly and nice. the purser even found out my birthday had been the day before and she said congratulations. Food portions were small, but the selection was well balanced. However, once the service was over, FAs retreated to the galley, I do not know if they did any drink rounds as I fell asleep for quite a bit. Air Canada does offer a far superior business class product on similar length flights in terms of food. service was more friendly on UA. IFE was the Direct TV product I was not familar with and I did not like that much. Pilots kept passengers informed continuously. Overall it was a nice flight and the price was amazingly cheap.

When we finally got customer service they said the earliest flight they could accommodate was Sunday arriving Monday (it was Wednesday). Our total time in Dublin was only 4.5 days. After much persistence they booked us through Delta for us to arrive on Friday. Because of their delay we lost a day of our trip and had to pay for a hotel in Chicago. Now the real fun begins when we tried to address our luggage. The luggage department said they made arrangements for our bags to be transferred to Delta. Delta didn't have them when we went to check in. They called United who said they put them on our connecting flight that we missed. 4 days and 6 phone calls later I was told our luggage was in Dublin if we wanted to pick it up.

In the last few years I have spent 2 unplanned nights in Denver, been reduced to tears of frustration on 2 other occasions, and have been late by more than 3 hours many times.

Despite an early landing in Milan, due to the lenghty custom procedures and the unavailability of the United Airlines personnel to assist me in expediting the process, despite my desperate running through the airport, I reached the gate too late for boarding. I had to take the later flight at 3.55. I missed a meeting in Orlando. The staff at the UA customer service desk were very unpleasant and were not be co-operative at all. I have to add that the 8.5 hour flight from MXP to Newark was also very unconfortable with poor quality food and noisy company. I complained to customer service and received a free ticket for a future flight with United for the value of 150 US Dollars. However, 6 days later, when on my way back to Italy from Florida I asked the UA personnel at MCO-Orlando to upgrade my ticket from Newark to Milano Malpensa UA19 to a business class ticket. The attendant at the counter told me that there were seats available, but an upgrade for my ticket was not available nor could I use the free ticket United gave me. If I wished to fly business class, I had to buy a new ticket. On my return flight (UA19) to Milan MXP from Newark on May 26, 2016 I again tried without success to get a more comfortable seat than the one assigned 45C (the very last seat on the rear right next to the lavatory). However, the cabin was full and the overbooking issue caused a delay in the departure. Despite my express request not to be seated near children or babies, I had a newborn sitting a couple of rows ahead of me. Luckily, he did not scream at all during the flight.

united-airlines;2016-05-29;" |  UA3345, Chicago - Washington on an E-175. Operated for United Airlines by Republic Airlines. This was the last leg of a nearly one-month trip that took me from PHL-DOH-KWI-DOH-PVG-DOH-KWI-DOH-LAX-YVR-ORD and now home to Washington. Of course, only on an American carrier do I find myself being spoken rudely to by member of the cabin crew. After boarding and taking my seat 2A (single seat by the window), I went to use the forward lavatory. The cockpit door was wide open with the captain, a young woman, sitting sideways in her seat. I greeted her and we started chatting. She was very interested to hear of several recent flights I’d had on the new A350 operated by QR. The FA in the first galley, interrupted me to say, “excuse me sir, you are in my space”. I replied, “I’m speaking with the captain” and moved slightly closer to the lavatory door. The captain and I chatted for a few more moments, then I went into the lavatory. Before the lavatory door was even shut, I heard the FA staying loudly to the captain, “I’m sorry, he just started talking to you”. I came out of the lavatory and said, “What is it that you are sorry for? I can speak to the captain before the door is closed and we push back from the gate. She was quite happy to have a conversation with me”. The FA said nothing. I went to my seat. The FA then came to ask me if I wanted something to drink pre-departure. I told her that it was rude of her to say what she said to the captain in a loud voice and that she could, at the least, have said once I was out of earshot. Before I had even finished speaking she just walked away from me. She came back to my seat and I asked her, “do you always just walk away while a passenger is speaking to you”. She mumbled something which wasn’t anything close to an apology. Unacceptably rude behavior and bad attitude toward a premium passenger in a first class cabin. Not such a nice ending to a long multi-segment trip.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-05-27;"My family and I were traveling to New Delhi, India in May from Newark and we were looking for a direct route from America to India to save time. The choices were between Air India and United. As we have tried Air India before, and we have not flown long haul with United for a long time, we decided to try out United's much touted ""new cabin experience"" in Economy class, where a ""three course meal"" would be presented, as well as improved services for Economy passengers. We had hoped United had improved since the last, disastrous time we flew them in 2013, but alas. It is the same lacklustre airline. Check in at EWR was relatively painless, and the TSA, is the TSA. We boarded and left relatively on time, and so far, things looked alright. And we were wrong about that. The 777-200 was old, to say the least, and in a shabby condition. The seats were worn and my recline didn't work- needless to say, for a 14 hour flight, this was simply not good enough, United. I was given a free drink to compensate, but a drink doesn't help you when you're stuck in an upright and uncomfortable position for 14 hours at 6 feet 3. My second gripe with this flight was the crew - and what a surly bunch they were. The ""three course meal"" much touted was not there - instead, we got served an awful mix of barbecue sauce and chicken, rice, and uncooked vegetables. There was no initial drinks run, and everything was served on one, tiny tray and due to this, our portion sizes were far too small. My son (aged 9) didn't eat anything for 12 hours. Breakfast was little better, with a choice between an uncooked omelette and an Indian vegetarian meal. The only saving grace of this flight was the IFE, but the screens were worn and did not respond to touch controls and the remotes in the armrest did not work. We have flown flights of similar length on Qatar or Emirates, and it is important to note how wonderful the food was, on those 16 hour voyages, and the plentiful snacks (I say ""snacks"", they were literally meals), and the courteous crews. There was none of that on a United flight of similar, or even longer length. The abysmal meals, disinterested and indifferent crews (who were nowhere to be seen after the initial meal service), and the shabby, worn condition of the plane and seats mean that I do not recommend United on such long haul flights of more than 10 hours. It's hard to believe that this airline is from Continental Airlines, which was (in my opinion), the best airline of America.";NEGATIVE

She never said clearly and specifically the we needed to do so prior to take off. Once in the air, no way to see movies or TV on an almost 5 hours flight. Why should I have to download a United app, what if I had not had electronic items with me? Paid the same for a far different experience. On the other plane they handed out a portable tablet to watch entertainment. Come on United, get current. Food offerings were both full of dough, either ravioli or a calzone.

united-airlines;2016-05-26;"San Francisco to Hong Kong. I was looking forward to my first time flying with United in an International leg. I have enjoyed their Domestic/Transborder route quite a few times. I've read on their website the improvement they made on their in-flight services so I was excited to experience it. But I knew my excitement will short-lived when I stepped into the boarding lunge to take my flight. Announcements after announcements were made by the gate agent that the flight will be full and that all big carry on must be check in. The boarding process itself was chaotic and the UA gate agents in SFO seemed annoyed and you can hardly see anyone smiling and genuinely greeting travelers as they board. They all look like they just want to get the boarding over and pass it on to the flight crew to deal with the guest. Once onboard, I was looking for the ""Plus"" in what United called their "" Economy Plus"" seats section. The seat pitch is just what other Airline like NH/CX/SQ offers in their regular economy section. The aircraft is an old 747 and it is quite ready to retire. Seats looks and smells dirty and really really old. I am a short person (5'6) and my knees almost touch the seat in front of me.There is also in IFE box under the seat in front which limits my legroom. Food service was the one I was anticipating and see how United made an improvement. The first meal service was a total disappointment. I wish I am lying right now when I say the food was horrible and inedible. I didn't finish my meal and only consumed the bread and veggies. THe second meal service was even worse. Noodles with no meat and it was so salty. Inflight entertainment is OK but on this aircraft, you have to download their Apps beforehand on your mobile device or else you will watch the Big Screen TV only that shows movie every 3hours. Flight Attendant are like robots and do a job without any emotion. Person next to me ask for another Ice cream and water and the FA told him that only one per passenger then left. FA's are nowhere to be seen after they turn off the lights after the meal service. I get up almost every hour on a long flight to stretch and not once I saw an FA. They re-emerge 2hours before landing to serve the meal. FA's are the worst I experience thus far travelling on an international flights.

The departure's departure was severely delayed, by more than 1.5 hours. Sms messenges from UA did not reflect any of the information about the delay. After embarking a 25 mins delayed we would sit and wait in the plane for almost an hour, while we were let to know in different ways that we are ready to leave soon. Upon arrival, again little information, even though all conducting passengers obviously had lost their flights' departures. After waiting in line on an under staffed customer service, we were given the usual tricky hotel voucher trip and sent on a mission to find out how to get there. First on our way to a bus stop with such bad descriptions that almost all passengers were lost on the way to find the shuttle bus. Maybe because no one would actually think that we were supposed to cross an insecure road and go through a road construction site for finding it? After asking bus drivers from other hotel services we waited for 25 minutes for the shuttle to the Weston hotel. Now time had gone and the kitchen where we could use the 10 dollars worth coupon for 'a meal' where there happens to be no meals so cheap. As a partner of United Airlines, this hotel also comes without a complimentary internet connection service. I will not trust UA again unless they change information and passenger handling significantly, and I will as much as possibletry to avoid flying with them. United Airlines must be the worst airline in the Star Alliance.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-05-24;"We flew from Buffalo, NY to Chicago and then to Maui in May 2016. The airline charges per suitcase. The female employee who was checking boarding passes at Buffalo was extremely rude. She got flustered when I pointed out that she had not given my niece's passport back to her and she stated, ""I thought you were all together! Next time you need to get here earlier. I almost unseated all of you!"" To which I replied that we had looked up what time to be there on United's website and it stated to be there an hour and a half before your flight, which we were. There was no entertainment available unless you brought your own hand held device. If you had your own hand held device, but didn't have earbuds or headphones, they didn't have any for you. It took my son six hours to watch a two hour movie because the WiFi kept shutting down. They charged us for the meals on a 9 hr flight - charged us for the Italian sandwich, which is what we ordered, but they gave us the turkey sandwich which was cheaper. If the food has improved (as I've seen from some reviews), I would have hated to eat it before. The seating was cramped and uncomfortable. We tried to upgrade and were told we couldn't. We were traveling with six people all together. They ruined 3 of the suitcases, one of them brand new. The steward staff on the return flight from Maui were very nice, polite, and professional, but it did not make up for all that we had already experienced. I won't take United again if it can be avoided. In short, United charges you for everything, but doesn't give you much in return.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-05-24;"United Airlines was outstanding on my recent trip from Boston to London. I was originally booked to fly from Boston to London via Washington-Dulles airport but around 8 hours before departure, I received a notification that the flight from Boston to DC had been canceled. I called United and got through to a friendly agent who confirmed  that I had already been rebooked onto a new itinerary via Newark that would get me to London only 3 hours later than originally planned. She booked me into an economy plus seat as I am a silver member and apologized for the cancelation. The check-in process had a couple minor problems at Boston as the self-service machine would not print a bag tag for me but an agent quickly assisted me at the counter. Boarding process was efficient -the new automatic ticket scanning gates at terminal B in Boston definitely speed up the process. I gate-checked one of my carry ons because it was too large to fit in the overhead bin. Onboard the short flight from BOS to EWR, there was personal device entertainment, which was a pleasant surprise as this was on a very small EMB-170 aircraft, which usually has no entertainment. Onboard service was minimal on this 45 minute flight and only water was offered. Nevertheless it was a comfortable flight. There was one small hiccup in the trip on arrival at Newark airport when I had to wait around 10 minutes to get my carry on back from gate check but I retrieved it in the end and everything went well with the connection. The long flight from Newark to London was very good with courteous and attentive flight attendants. Dinner was served promptly after take-off and the food was decent by airline standards. The only disappointment was that there was no dessert except for a small pot of sorbet which had a strange taste, and water was strangely only provided after the meal instead of before. Entertainment options were plentiful with personal device entertainment or seat back on demand with a varied selection. Seats were comfortable when reclined and there was plenty of leg room in economy plus. Upon arrival in London, the baggage claim process was very efficient and the bags were already on the belt by the time I got through customs. Overall, a seamless, comfortable and relaxed trip with United. In the past, I have had trouble with United but they are quickly learning from their mistakes and improving greatly. I will definitely continue flying with them in the future.";POSITIVE

I am always in the premium economy section (only gives one more legroom unlike other airlines which deliver a premium economy as something midway between business and economy). This flight from Munich to Washington was fine. The food was pretty tasty, and included a premium ice cream. The snack before landing was perfect. Service was cordial and efficient, with water and other drinks offered on a regular basis. They handed out individual bottles of water.  There was a great selection of films and tv. My only complaint would be the toilets, which go unattended for the entire flight - and some of them get pretty messed up. ";POSITIVE

Even though my expensive United Club card allowed me 2 free bags and the code-share partner, ANA allows for 2 free bags.  United has lost my ticket.

However, sorry to say I just had to this time. We recently were returning from vacation where my sons anxiety disorder worsened considerably and we had to get home quickly. We had the worst flying experience in all of our flying history. We had never flown United before. Never will again. My son has a medical issue as I mentioned. I planned ahead and paid for premium seats to assure we were all sitting together. Our flight before that came in with about 10 minutes to spare for us to board this connecting flight. By the time we got there, people were still in line to board. However, the desk agent ""removed"" us from the trip. They quickly realized that this decision was a little premature so they offered us some open seat tickets. None of course were next to each other. However, this is why I spent an hour on the phone with United the night before...to make sure we were together in case something happened with my son. I asked if they would be willing to talk to the other customers(travelers) and see if anyone would be willing to switch seats with us as it was the agent who removed us in the first place. He simply walked away. When he came back, I asked if we could resolve this. Apparently the lady next to him was already assigning the extra tickets now to someone else. We now with no choice of our own had to wait for the next flight which I luckily had pre-booked the night before just in case we truly did miss the connection. Only because united had sent us an email that the first flight was already delayed by an hour and a half. All during the process of this the desk agent kept talking to other people, never once apologized for the stress he was causing. He was extremely rude, and said that unless my son has a heart issue or has an oxygen tank that it wasnt his problem. When my son heard this, it immediately hit a nerve and the guilt of us having to deal with this agent in this way and the frustratingly awful customer service sent my son into a debilitating anxiety attack (looks like a seizure). Yet still the agent continued to be defensive. Not one apology, or assistance from anyone at that desk. Clearly, the trouble I had for over an hour on the phone with United the night before made no difference. When I asked if there was someone I could speak with to get further assistance I was told ""yeah, its called online'. Once we boarded, the level of professionalism was atrocious. The flight attendants could be heard talking about the men they dated, rammed the drink cart along passenger seats multiple times, could barely be bothered to actually listen to your order, forget about asking for a blanket. Thank you for your sympathy United for an already very tough situation.";NEGATIVE

Check in staff were not so friendly or helpful. I was a fan of Continental back before the merger, and thinking United would uphold some of the standards I have taken them on a few occasions - but clearly I'm mistaken and sadly disappointed with staff and specifically aircraft comfort and appearance.

We all had separate seats even my 3yr old daughter! I went to ask for assistance and was given the ""we can't assist you with your seats, then she points to the sign ""bag drop off only"". She then said go sort yourself out at the gate. we got to the gate, and waited for someone to assist us at the service desk. When someone finally appeared. We asked if they could help us with the seating arrangements, because how could they seat a child on their own. We were told they couldn't help with seating arrangements we needed to go to the ticketing desk, which was on the other side of the terminal! we were told we can go ask people to move so we could sit next to my daughter. Frustrating! Then before boarding we were stopped by the gate boarding attendant and was told we had too many bags! We are allowed two bags per person. There was four of us, we had seven bags. She made my mum ruffle around to consolidate our bags, but I told the attendant that my daughter is a person and we paid full price for her, She (my daughter) is allowed two bags! 2x4=8! The attendant then looked at me blankly and just let us through not even apologising for her mistake! Rude! A week later my parents return trip from Oklahoma was booked with United airlines. When they got there (their English is limited) they asked for assistance with the self check in. The two ladies that went to help them, told my parents they had too many bags. Again! My mum had two bags, dad the same. Mum was holding her jacket and a travel pillow for the flight. They bullied my parents to the point, that my mum said she didn't want any more hassle and was happy to pay for the baggage fee. My mum had only cash, but they told my mum they don't accept cash, only credit card! By this time it was almost boarding time for them, then a supervisor of the airline came to see what was the fuss, the supervisor told my parents that they can go because they have the correct amount of bags - just plain rudeness! No customer service! Would never recommend anyone to fly with them! United airlines horrible! If I had a choice I wouldn't give them one star! ";NEGATIVE

Sadly dissapointment started when they took my bottle of water just outside the plane - (no bottled water given on board). I was quite suprised that the aircraft actually looked older than I did - not a good thing. No in seat entertainment and the premium economy seats were exactly the same as economy but you got a couple of extra inches legroom. There were instructions on how to use your own ipad and the United entertainment system but you could only do so if you had already downloaded the app - thanks for telling me in advance. Or I could pay $15.99 for wireless to download it. The food was awful, the pasta was rubbery and had a very odd taste, so on the way back on the same terrible plane got a sandwich from the deli near gate 102 - much better. Was it worth the money to upgrade to premium economy - no, except that I had an empty seat next to me on the way out. Will never fly United Airlines again.

I explained my need to get to Minnesota before 1:30 and the AUS attendant got me onto the next flight to Houston to make the next flight to MSP which was scheduled to arrive at 1:17pm. The National Cemetery is right next to the airport and the time is approximately 10 minutes from the airport to the cemetery via the highway. At Houston, I asked the attendant if I could be off the plane first when it arrived at MSP. She said ""No"" but she did move my seat assignment closer to the door. I also asked if they could request a sky cab/cart upon landing so it could take me to the taxi cab stands located outside the airport. They made those arrangements for me. Fortunately the plane arrived 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled arrival time. The sky cab/cart arrived just as I got into the terminal. The driver whisked me as close as he could to the taxi cab stands and explained the quickest way to get to the taxis.

Legroom was good although seat width felt a bit narrow and looked to be the same as economy. That was about it in the way of 'perks' compared to economy as far as I could see. As for the flight, one hour delay in taking off and strong winds delayed our arrival. Good choice of entertainment. Meals were reasonable and I managed to get a brief nap. I had a look at the economy legroom and it looked poor, so I was glad we upgraded but I would class it as only extra legroom rather than a premium product.";POSITIVE

There is now paid DirecTV service on 737 seatbacks with non-stop advertising running in a loop from the minute you board the aircraft constantly nagging you to swipe a credit card. Sadly, neither DirecTV nor in-flight wifi worked over the Pacific, which made the whole entertainment system pointless for the 5 hour crossing. It also looks like United has also removed the music channels, including my personal favorite, flight deck chatter.

The flight from Seattle to Houston was not the greatest since we had to be diverted to another city due to weather and lack of fuel. The flight was super bumpy and this caused me to miss my connecting flight from Houston to Orlando, but United gave me a partial voucher for my hotel accommodations and I was just grateful to be safe. I also had the hope of making an early flight the next morning so I could return home and get back to work from the conference I was attending. Due to weather conditions and staff shortage, I had 5 rescheduled flights delayed then canceled. I was even about to board 2 of the 5 and the staff just said, ""Sorry, these are canceled,' without any further explanation. I received no hotel voucher the second night, and since I was trying to get on several flights throughout the day, the hotels got full and I had no where to sleep. Fearing that I would face a 6th canceled flight, I made other travel accommodations and finally got out of that miserable city. I get that many airlines were canceling flights due to the horrific weather conditions, but I was astonished at the lack of communication, empathy, kindness, and understanding we received from the United staff. I understand that we may receive full vouchers or refunds due to weather but at least be courteous. I then come to find out that my refund request for the ticket seemed to come back approved but upon further investigation I found that I will only receive a partial refund since United technically got me to one of the two cities. I just wish I got more understanding and communication throughout the process, and that's the main reason why I'll never fly with United again and will encourage those around me to not choose United either.

Checked in at LAS at a staffed desk, this was quick friendly and efficient. After security, which was quiet at the time of the process, we made our way to the Lounge for a 1+ hour wait. Plenty of drinks and nibbles were available and the food area was clean and tidy. It was too early in the day to use the bar! Boarding was by the standard UA ‘Group’ System, and being in the first group as stated the boarding pass this was completely painless. On board welcome drinks were offered prior to departure. Meal orders for lunch were also taken. After departure we noticed that the aircraft appeared to level off a bit early and that turns were being made over the Lake Mead area. This manoeuvre lasted for about 10+minutes which we found to be slightly alarming. My co-traveller mentioned this to one of the FAs who advised that ‘systems’ were being checked. No flight deck announcement was ever made on this situation. Once the aircraft started to climb again and it was obvious that the aircraft was on course for IAD we were able to relax more and enjoy the well presented lunch and numerous top ups of wine! In spite of the unusual post departure manoeuvres the flight arrived at the gate in IAD a few minutes early. We checked the gate number for the onward DUB flight which was departing a few gates away on the same concourse. We were able to use the UA lounge at IAD for a short stay, this facility was heaving at the time of our mid evening visit so perhaps not so enjoyable. Boarding for Dublin flight commenced about 20 minutes late due to the aircraft's delay from a previous flight. On board the FA in charge greeted each Business-First passenger, and as on the previous sector drinks were service prior to departure along with orders for dinner. Inflight, dinner and more drinks were served. Having eaten earlier there was actually too much food on offer! We did notice that most fellow travellers had skipped the final cheese and desert courses to try and get some sleep. Around 1.5 hours out of Dublin a breakfast was served. The aircraft arrived 10 minutes early. From the gate it was a fair walk along corridors to the immigration and customs area which was near empty at the time of our visit. To conclude, the service on all sectors was great. The tickets purchased in ‘P’ booking class which originated in Dublin were competitively priced, and worth the extra trip from Edinburgh.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2016-04-14;" |  Washington to Melbourne via Los Angeles with United - the worst things about this route are the terminals and the United Clubs. D terminal at IAD is little better than a Quonset hut with carpeting, and Terminal 7 at LAX is a smelly, dirty disgrace made even worse by blaring security announcements every few minutes. The United Clubs in both places are old, tatty, dirty and full of people having loud, self-important conversations on cellphones since UA does nothing to regulate this kind of conduct. The Boeing 772 service to LAX was fully loaded, boarding was orderly, except that the cabin crew did nothing to assist disabled passengers to get seated and sorted before the rest of us got on. It was the same with disembarkation at LAX, so the aisles were brought to a standstill by poor people with physical limits trying to get on and off with the rest of us. The 772 was old and showing it. Things did not work. My IFE system went on the fritz. An FA willingly reset it and then checked, and when it still did not recover, gave me a coupon which I later used online to add 5,000 points to my Mileage Plus account. The inflight wifi also did not work for me 90 percent of the time, but my neighbour could use it it, albeit with very slow up and down speeds. One has to apply online for a refund. The Boeing 787 LAX-MEL was still new and fully functional, and this time the food was edible, though the portions were minuscule, and with dinner service about 1 hour after lift off and breakfast about 1 hour before landing, the 12-13 hours without food in between seemed long, even to me who is not a big eater, though one can buy food from the food for purchase menu. The crew on this leg were short on customer service skills, barking out requests, never a ""please"" or ""thank you"" and not a single hydration round. They seemed pretty sour about something, but when I went to the rear galley to find an empty restroom, a few of them were sitting around and chatting in a very jovial way with each other. Toilets not maintained at all for the 15 hours. Even so, we were on time, things went efficiently, the IFE choices were good, and the IFE system on the B789 was very good. If the hard product on the old 772s is upgraded and the effort to promote customer service skills among cabin crew continues, the improvement in United's service I've noticed over the last couple of years might just continue.

On 2nd internal flight from Newark to Miami, 3 seats allocated to us were scatted throughout the plane, we are a family of 2 adults 1 child (5) and a baby. This should not be allowed and after complaining they gave us 3 together. Service onboard was much better than the international flight with great attendants. 3rd internal flight Miami to Newark the worst with very rude staff on the check-in desk who ignored us for about 10-15 minutes. Again we requested an infant cot for our international flight and were told we had it as we were one of the first to check in, flight delayed and only just made our connection to 4th flight by seconds. Asked for our sky cot only to be told sorry someone asked for it on the plane and they had given it to them. I said I was unhappy as we requested it 6hrs ago and were met with very rude cabin staff.

To begin, our flight was changed at the very last minute, and our seats were changed/not assigned. We called the airline immediately for information, and the only information we received was that they were unable to do anything until we were at the gate, forcing us to go to the airport much earlier in order to figure out what was going on. Once we arrived, we were misinformed about placing ourselves on the standby list in regards to the fact that we were even able to be on the list with checked baggage and we would be provided a refund. When we asked about what would happen to our checked bags, we were then forced to be taken off of the standby list, thus, not using this service. The service quality while on the flight was not horrible, but the service leading up to the flight was not acceptable. Once we were charged for the standby list, the service we received was even worse. We were told that we would not be able to receive a refund, and then told we would have to submit a request online. All of the individuals we spoke with were rude, confused, or both. If you are adamant about flying with this airline, please do yourself a favor and understand everything that you need to have before/during/after your flight (checked bags, times you need to leave by, WiFi which is NOT included, etc.). As new flyers, I have to say that this airline was not helpful at all.";NEGATIVE

United uses the Cathay Pacific lounge in Melbourne which is small and has a very narrow range of amenities. On board, the aircraft had a nicely appointed interior. UA uses a 2x2x2 configuration in business class which feels cramped. The seat was fairly comfortable but lacked storage space. The FA that looked after our section of the cabin was disengaged and uninterested. Lunch and breakfast were mediocre and the mid-flight snacks were simply abysmal. Wine selection was limited and labels available were well below what a business class offering should be. Part way through the flight I enquired if the aircraft was equipped to offer espresso coffees. The FA said it was but they were never supplied with the pods and that UA was planning to rip them out. This is a clear sign that UA is simply not interested in providing a differentiated service. IFE had a decent range of movies but music selection was not great. Toilets were not attended to very frequently as evidenced by the clutter and lack of supplies. Overall a disappointing business class experience.";NEGATIVE

The first was in Chicago, IL at nght and my connecting flight was even delayed and in the gate right next to the gate I was in. But my bag made it on that flight, but I didn't.

After we got off that flight everything was handled poorly - our flight was cancelled without even a hours notice or any explaination why, we were offered standby on two flights to Detriot and a 3rd option of staying the night(without compensation for a room) in Chicago and going to Detriot in the morning(3 pretty poor options). We were told no flights would be able to connect us to Detriot until the following day. After both of the standby flights were delayed we asked a different customer service desk to put us on a flight to Grand Rapids, which they were able to do. Once we arrived in Grand Rapids, our only checked bag was not on the plane. At no point was the staff willing to do the right thing.

The aircraft cabin was quite clean and the seats were comfortable, the flight attendants were friendly when serving food and drinks to passengers. There was a choice of chicken noodles and scrambled eggs for the in-flight meal, I chose chicken noodles for my meal, unfortunately it was not to my liking as the noodles were too dry.

The Boeing 787 was new, in excellent condition, clean, seats quite comfortable for me, and a very good IFE product. Similarly with the Boeing 737-900 from LAX to IAD.

My daughter who flew the same time we did via Southwest - both her flights going and coming back home were on time. I will not fly United again if I can help it. I will spend extra money just so I can fly on another airline other than United. Gas has gotten cheaper and the airline could not forego charging for luggage check which further delays the flight since everyone wants to carry their suitcases with them to the plane to avoid the fees. We were in Group 5 last night and people who had their suitcases with them had to check them in for free because there was no more room available for their bags in the plane and I think this is not fair because my husband and I checked in our small bags and we had to pay for them. It seems this is a punishment for people who check in their bags and for those who did not and then at the last minute had to check them in because of lack of room for their bags for FREE!

We were then told the flight was then delayed by 8 hours (supposed to leave around 2 in in the afternoon but I later checked and and it didn't leave until 5). No one expalined the situation until 2 hours later. There was no apologies or complimentary coffee to help make the long wait bearable. I understand that is always a risk when flying but I waited in line for over 4 hours to be rebooked onto a flight and given a hotel voucher so vague not even the staff at Dallas could tell me what to do (I would be in Cozumel a day late). No information on the hotel number or address or shuttle. Just the name and there were two in the city. Not being from the US I then had to use roaming charges to try and find my reservation. There was no reservation at either and no shuttle according to the hotel. Just take my advice and pay a little extra if you can for a different airline because I would not wish this situation on anyone.;NEGATIVE

Even the return flight for the baggage is limited to one bag, even though we are with Air New Zealand. Called the airline and the answer is that you have to go with United rules of baggage and can not pre pay for excess baggage - you have to pay at the airport $200.00 against $1.00 which Air NZ is charging for excess baggage as a promotional.

Our seats from Washington to Orlando were changed on check in and had us separated from kids but agent in London sorted it no problem. Also a nice touch was arriving in London late yesterday morning the crew moved as many connecting pax as they could forward and also asked anyone not connecting to allow those with connections off first and amazingly everyone obliged! I must say I wasn't looking forward to the trip given some reviews  (booked this way as cheapest option), but I was pleasantly surprised and would not hesitate to use again though would try to avoid the Boeing 757 transatlantic legs where possible.

united-airlines;2016-04-02;"Chicago to London return, both flights basically the same as this LHR-IAD sector, with the exception of a fully functioning in-flight entertainment system. Check in with United in London is at its worst average and usually much better. I swear Heathrow has the best ground staff in the entire United system. Was informed the Star Golds now when access to fast track security which is used. It is a very long walk to the United Club but I was prepared for that. The United Club in London is tops and with great staff. The plane was a typical old Boeing 767 that United flies between London and Chicago. While old, it is fairly comfortable in Economy Plus as long as you aren't big into watching video. The screens are small with poor resolution and the sound for the video wasn't working on this flight. Still, all was set up with fresh pillows and blankets and the plane was clean. The thing that made this trip even better was that the economy cabin was empty. My guess is there were 25 of us in back with the front two cabins almost full. The lunch was decent though the portions were quite small. I don't like the pre-landing snack so I always bring my own food onboard for that meal. Flight attendants were friendly. In fact, everyone in Economy was in a good mood that day and, who wouldn't be with all of that room. We were delayed in London due to traffic and weather. Arrived in Chicago having made up about half of the delay. Baggage was out in a very acceptable amount of time. I do this route a fair amount and it is usually one of United's best. Much of that has to do with the London ground staff which is often exceptional and some of the flight attendants who routinely work this route. Fly this route four or five times a year and people will start to recognize you.  I am no fan of the new United and this flight isn't quite as much of a joy when full but flying this route tends to be one of the better experiences when traveling on the new United.";POSITIVE

After arriving in Kauai we looked again at our itinerary and noticed our return flight had a missing leg from Kauai back to Honolulu. Hoping United could assist with an error that was made by their booking agent, we gave them a call. After nearly an hour on the phone, the supervisor told us there was nothing he could do except to rebook the trip. This would cost us $288 per person for a 45 minute flight back to Honolulu to Kauai plus a  $400 change fee. Totaling just under $1000 for a 45 minute, 1-way flight. After being rudely spoken to and blamed for a mistake we couldn't have made, we were told to ""have a nice day"" and promptly hung up on. We immediately called another airline, we were on the phone for less than 10 minutes and booked a connecting leg from Kauai to Honolulu for $178 total.

My evening flight was very full and about 45 minutes delayed. The staff was not equipped or prepped for this. They were unpleasant and neglectful. My seat was by the window for the 4 hour flight with an elderly couple on the aisle side and absolutely no room to move around. When they got up to use the restroom, I took the opportunity as well. There was a snack truck on one end and it wouldn't allow anyone through so I went to the front to use the restroom. As I was waiting, the flight attendant told me that I needed to wait for the snack cart and use the back restroom. Since the older couple was done, I didn't want them to have to get up again and had to wait until we landed to use the restroom. I have been on Southwest before when a full flight was delayed for 20 minutes and the passengers were all given access to all channels but nothing was done on this fight. But the worst part about this flight is still sticking with me and I pray that this man is okay today. As we were departing the plane, a man was obviously slouched over into the aisle. It was clear to all of the passengers around that this man was not asleep but unconscious. A passenger was taking his pulse and another yelling for help. There were no attendants around to help with this man or with anyone else on this very crowded flight. That kind of service is inexcusable. Because of the delay, I missed my connecting flight which had been bundled by United. I went to customer service and there were about 50 people in line. I called customer service while in line and the lady booked me for what she said was the next flight at 5:58 am-7 hours later and offered no accommodations. My husband called and they put me on a flight that was boarding as I stood in line and only 2 gates away. I was relieved and tired. I got on the plane and found it way more comfortable and with more leg room-would have been nice for the previous full flight. I was having trouble lifting my carry on to stow it and had to ask an attendant to help as he watched me struggle with it. By this time, I still had not used the restroom. This flight was delayed and I had to wait even longer. As I sat down to rest, the cart came by with drinks. The lady didn't even ask me for a drink because I guess she assumed I was asleep.

Being 6ft 2 inches my leg room was primarily found under the seat in front of me. When my seat mate needed to go to the washroom, the dynamic was equaled to the struggles of the same issue in economy.

We were then stranded in the bus for 35 minutes with no explanation, and not allowed to get off the bus. In other words, United doubled down on its incompetence and unreliability by further inconveniencing its passengers by directing them to board a bus and then demonstrating what I construe as willful and intentional contempt for the passengers by stranding them in the bus with no explanation. I recall that one person had to ask to use the toilet before the flight left because, even though most people probably did so before being told to board, the delay due to the airline's incompetence and disregard for its customers resulted in the need to do so again.";NEGATIVE

There was an agent chatting and paying no attention to customers, so given I had very little time left, I thought I'd use the self check-in machine. Those machines are not very user friendly at all! It wouldn't recognize the name of the city where I was staying and the name of the hotel. I was timed-out after trying 3 times, and only when I exasperated loudly did the check-in lady look up and nonchalantly say, ""If you're having trouble go over there."" Over there was the other end of the booths, where an agent seemed oblivious to her surroundings. By the time I rushed to her and handed my passport, she told me that I was late and wasn't going anywhere. Then she pointed out that I had a checked bag and so I was definitely not getting on this flight. I raised my voice out of despair, and explained to her that I had spent 15 minutes trying to figure out their machines. I was even the one who ""apologized"" saying it wasn't her fault. Instead of her apologizing for being inconvenienced by the airlines for whom she works, she had the nerve to look up at the other agent and ask her if I was telling the truth!  She then told me she could get me on a flight that'll get me to Providence by 11:55PM. That's when I told I needed to be there in the afternoon because I had a rental. Of course, she wouldn't override the system and open the gate, claiming it was too late even though it was an hour before boarding. She then sai, how about the flight through Chicago that'll get me to Providence by 9:55. Asking me like I even have a choice in the matter.

After 45m on the ground we went back out and eventually landed at Dulles. But our connecting flights had all left, so waited another 45m to get an alternate flight (Friday at noon). CSR said the issue was air traffic, not turbulence, so not their problem that we haven't any place to stay here and an expensive, paid-for hotel room waiting for us in Greensboro. After being questioned more insistently, the CSR grudgingly gave us a voucher that got us a discounted (not free!) hotel room. Back to the airport today - at 10:30, 11, 11:30, the board still showed our flight as ""on time"". After the scheduled boarding time of noon came and went, checked with the gate agent - flight is now delayed to 3pm. We can only hope, since if they cancel it (the flight isn't full) and put us on the 5pm flight, we won't make Greensboro in time for the concert. I'll hopefully never fly United again. Ultimately, we could have driven in the time we've spent in airports so far, and probably could have driven from Washington to Greensboro in the time we've spent at the airport today.";NEGATIVE

Seats on the old Boeing 747-400 were uncomfortable and there was so little space for me to stretch out my legs. There was no inflight entertainment except for one big screen that showed movies. Food service was okay, I enjoyed the chicken katsu curry they served. Flight delayed a bit at Chicago, but when we were finally boarding, the flight was full so they had to take carry-on bags and stow them with the checked luggage. Pretty disappointed that United Airlines couldn't find a way to fix that problem. Flight was really crowded so I felt squished in and couldn't move that much. In total, I wouldn't fly with United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

I had paid extra for an exit row seat and there were 2 passengers next to me. The flight attendant advised that the next block of exit row seats in the back cabin were all vacant if we wanted to relocate. The flight left HNL on time and arrived in LAX early. The crew were friendly and courteous. My only criticism was as this was a 7:00am departure, there wasn’t really any breakfast options or a meal service available on this flight. Luckily I had breakfast in the United Club lounge before departure.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-03-17;"Chicago to London Heathrow with United Airlines. First of all, getting on the aircraft was very simple and quick. There were surprisingly few people on the flight and after we went to the seats we were assigned to, we were allowed to move and spread out. Most of us were able to have an entire row of two to three seats to ourselves which greatly enhanced the comfort of such a long international flight. We were warmly welcomed and I could see the safety demonstration well. The food and drink service was efficient and often. The assortment of drinks was welcomed, and so was the snack. The dinner, as expected in economy class on an airplane was not the best, but it did include gelato which was a treat. They provided newspapers and magazines as well. However I could never figure out the entertainment system, nor the wifi within the airplane. The darkening of the cabin was timely, the restrooms were very clean and actually relatively spacious and well lit. The staff was curtious. As well as they were helpful with special assistance when needed.";POSITIVE

But, right after you board with your group, and they scan your ticket, they will lead you to a Second Checkpoint. This checkpoint will relieve you of liquids. Note that since you've already gone through the airport security which removes all liquids, everything they take from you was bought or filled right there in the secured area of the airport. And this includes liquor bought from duty free. On the flight water bottles are passed out twice for most of the cabins (during the 15 hour flight), but the poor souls back in economy have to Pay to get water. I have to assume this second checkpoint policy is about extracting more money from you both in concession sales and duty free. ";NEGATIVE

An unplanned refuelling stopover was added at Bangor because of strong headwinds over the Atlantic. Arrived in Bangor in the evening, around 7pm. Stop was supposed to be a matter of 45 min but the crew announced there was a mechanical issue and a mechanic had to intervene. Waited for mechanic in the plane for two hours. After two hours were told to disembark because finally, the crew could legally not fly anymore. Were told to go into the terminal. Waited there for about three hours after which we were told we would do our immigration clearance in Bangor. Did immigration clearance but were then told to basically sleep over at the airport as our plane would only take off at 9am next day. So basically, all passengers slept on the floor at Bangor airport till the next day. Avoid United like the plague. That airline is just awful. Rating other aspects of the airline low as the plane (757) is old and cannot understand why they fly it between Paris and NY if it can barely make the distance non-stop.";NEGATIVE

The plane  had a new seat design that offered a little more comfort than the previous flights. The seats also had power outlets. The inflight entertainment was not very good. The entertainment consisted of the TV playing the same video the entire 4 hour flight and the only way to change the channel was to pay $6. This was a huge disappointment to other flights I have taken where United offered free movies and some TV shows. Overall though I was pretty impressed with United and their staff. ;POSITIVE

Of course United has no concern, they are not accountable, you always can pay for airport ""food"". My flight from George Bush Airport to Philadelphia Airport was also delayed multiple times.

And the food they did have was disgusting.  United couldn't even get my checked baggage to my destination on time then went on to lose it entirely on the way home.

I keep my head down and expect some bumps along the way. There is little recourse no matter what happens when up against these types of companies. They know full well they can throw you out if you don't comply. We were yelled at and if we didn't answer in time, they would quickly repeat the question over and over getting louder each time.

On top of that they changed our flight home to go from having our flight be 5 hours to almost 10. They had no empathy, had nothing to offer and was not willing to give me any type of compensation.

To reroute her to Seattle and offer no hotel vouchers, or meal vouchers, so that she was forced to sleep in the airport from 1:15 am to 8am. They also made her check her bag in GSP, not because of size or weight, but because of her tight connecting flight in SFO (which she was unable to make due to the hour delay in ORD) So, all for $551, plus $25 bag fee, plus anxiety and stress for a first time, solo traveler. And to add even more insult, her bag won't even arrive when she does! She has to wait an entire day for her bag to arrive in RDM.

united-airlines;2016-02-23;"My wife and I had a horrible experience in a round-trip international flight with United Airlines. In our departure flight, when we wanted to check in at SFO, United staff told us that United would not deliver our baggage in our final destination and we would need to pick up our baggage in our second stop, Dubai. When we tried to pick up our baggage in Dubai, airport staff said UAE visa is required to go to baggage claim area and since we did not have UAE visa, they didn't allow us to pick up our baggage. After lots of negotiations and asking several people for advice, we found out that we would need to pay $84 to transfer our baggage. Our flight back to US was supposed to be operated by Austrian Airlines (we bought the round-trip ticket from United) with 2 stops in Vienna and Zurich. When we went to airport, Austrian Airlines staff didn't allow us to check in. They said that flight from Vienna to Zurich is a domestic flight in European Union and would require Schengen Visa. So, we had to reschedule our flight with Lufthansa, we paid $1000 and could get another flight for 2 days later. If United had informed us about those issues when we bought the ticket or even at the airport, none of those problems would have happened. I asked United to reimburse us for all those extra costs but they only offered us two $150 flight certificates, which are basically useless, most of the time United tickets are more expensive than other flights and those $150 dollar certificates hardly have $20 cash value each. They don’t even have a phone number for complaints. The only way you can contact them for complaints, is email or voicemail. I think they have so many complaints that they cannot handle, so they have decided to just offer $150 to $200 to anyone who fills out a complaint instead of hearing the details and trying to improve their customer service. Be very careful when you fly with United. Check all the single details of your trip, take some food with you in long flights and do not expect them to answer their phone. The moment you pay for the ticket, you are on your own.";NEGATIVE

United managed to add to our itinerary a 12 hour delay due to malfunctioning aircraft, included in this delay were a few hours on that unbearably hot and uncomfortable plane, without even a drink being offered, before being ushered back to the gate now completely void of any United Airline staff and therefore information. A $15 food voucher (1 airport priced sandwich) was the compensation for the day lost from the vacation and $100's lost in missed excursions. We were told that customer services would have a full record of the events and on our return we should discuss the possibility of an upgrade on our longest return flight. At the customer service desk at Newark they said that they had no details of our journey and couldn't / wouldn't look into it but suggested phoning customer services, remember that we were standing at the customer services desk!

Flew from Seattle to Puerto Rico, I'd never flown domestic business and I've since learned it's not worth it from all reviews (to put it mildly). It started with the lounge. It was about 6.30 pm when I got there, and I had run out of the house without dinner, assuming I could get some snacks in the lounge and dinner on the plane. The lounge had about 6 crackers scattered in a bowl, a couple of cut up strips of bell pepper, and 4 warm cheese cubes. When I asked the bartender if they had some more crackers, or maybe even some cheese and cold cuts (the empty dishes had little leftover traces of what appeared to be cold cuts), I was told ""what was out there was what was there"". I took my 6 crackers and 4 strips of bell pepper and went to log on to the WiFi. It wouldn't accept the password and when I finally got logged on it was dial-up slow. When I got to my seat on the plane (which wasn't terrible, but wasn't anything near what I was expecting, again, I'd only used business for international flights previously), I was disgusted the find the middle console/arm rest covered in crumbs and something sticky. I was annoyed at this point so I took a picture and posted it on their Facebook, and someone did reply within an hour or so, but all they did was ask for the flight number, there was never any other follow up. It would have been nice just to get a quick, sorry about that reply. The service was ok, the food was better that what you'd get from economy, but that's about it. Coming back was also less than smooth. I understand Newark is a busy airport, but the gates were awful. They changed gates at the last minute and their app didn't update, so when I left the lounge I started walking to where the app said they gate was. I was about halfway there when I saw a screen that listed the correct gate and had to backtrack. I guess the fault in that was mine because I should have, as they say ""trust[ed] but verify[ed]"" instead of assuming the app would have some sort of auto-updating feature. They were boarding groups 1 and 2 with the business class group, so the line was long and not pleasant (though nowhere near as long or chaotic as group 3/4/5 and 6/7 lines - they didnt have dividers or anything, so the lines were mixed together and people were squabbling with other people who walked up to what they assumed was the end of the line and wasnt). All in all, compared to the foreign airlines I've used, United's standards were sadly lacking and showed their age/indifference.";NEGATIVE

Still needing the facilities, I pushed my wheelchair forward two feet and crutched to it until I made it to the restroom. A passer by assisted me with getting a bottle of water.

There was no trouble making connections with Las Vegas to State College PA via Chicago flights, even given poor weather and the need to de-ice. The cabins on all of their planes however, remain cramped and they are almost always full. This is an industry-wide problem, and it isn't any better on any of United's competitors. My primary complaint is United's Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment services - and this is limited only to their Boeing aircraft. The outbound part of my trip was on an Airbus A320. There are never any connectivity issues, and those planes have a nice library of TV shows and movies to stream over my tablet. The Boeing portion of their fleet, however, is a WiFi disaster. It was so bad on that leg of the trip the flight crew had to do the safety announcement themselves rather than rely on the video that United probably spent millions of dollars producing. If you're able to connect at all on the Boeing planes, the connection is unreliable. United would like you to pay for this service, too. Just don't. It's a rip off. United really needs to end their relationship with Direct TV, and switch their entire fleet over to the system on the Airbus planes. Bring a tablet, download a couple movies on it. It's the only way you'll be able to watch something on their Boeing fleet. Beyond the entertainment issue, the cramped cabins that all the airlines have, and the standard hassle with TSA, United is still a good bet. They go places a lot of the other carriers just don't. The crews are generally friendly, and their airfares are competitive. Oh, and there were really unusual little complimentary snack packages they were handing out. Not the typical nuts or chips. They were surprisingly tasty. Too bad they were so small.";POSITIVE

People had boarded the flight ready to fly to Australia, little did they know they weren’t going to be on the plane for a further 24 hrs. After further mechanical delays (four hours later) to determine if the plane was fit to fly. United decided to cancel my flight to Melbourne. During this whole ordeal I was told different information from United Staff. We were accommodated for in terms of accommodation for the night, and were handed vouchers. The problem was United Staff were adamant that you could use the vouchers anywhere, but in reality when you showed people these vouchers they would not accept them. I had to pay for the extra day over in LAX out of my pocket. Originally I had a premium economy aisle seat on the first flight on the 8th January, on the return flight I received a faulty seat at the back of the plane in economy. I had been told at the service desk that my seating would not be downgraded. Not only was my seat downgraded, the seat I received was faulty. After talking to United staff on the plane, to my surprise staff didn’t try to accommodate myself. This 24 hour delay resulted in me missing a day of work.

Once at the gate I saw that all 14 of the upgrade requests had been accepted. The cabin was now completely full with a resulting slowness in the service and delay in lights out for sleeping. The seat itself coverts into lie flat but does not seem to be much wider than the economy class seat as they are arranged 8 abreast. Feet have to be put into quite a narrow slot that makes it difficult to turn over. A lot of the flight entertainment movies were old James Bond titles. The evening meal was OK but nothing more than that. I am not sure why they feel offering ice cream for dessert is something special. Unlike some airlines there was a full hot breakfast.

The manager then stated it was my fault for not checking that my flight hadn't changed. He said it was not United's policy to notify people when the flights change, in this case, bringing it forward 1 hour. They could not then get me another direct flight, so now instead of being in Vancouver at 10am it'll be closer to 4pm. So the plane was older than me, and once we are all on board they say a seat is broken and we all need to get off so they can fix it. The worst bit was the lack of empathy and customer service.

united-airlines;2016-02-14;"Minneapolis to Los Angeles via Denver. United Airlines screwed up our family vacation and cost me $1400.00. As a relatively frequent traveler taking several flights a year I have picked my flights based on cost and convenient times and dates regardless of airline. After my recent experience with United, I will no longer book United flights. Our family traveled to Los Angeles for New Years Eve and the Rose Bowl. My boys who both had recently started new jobs could only get a limited amount of time off so I flew them out on New Years Eve to meet us for a long weekend. On a night with perfect weather conditions their flight from Minneapolis to Denver was delayed due to mechanical problems and they missed their connecting flight to Los Angeles by a few minutes. They called me very distressed because the United agent told them they couldn't fly them to Los aneles until January 2, the day they had to return home. Our family then went on line and found an Amercan flight that would get them to Los Angeles in time to get to the Rose Bowl game on New Years. In the aftermath I contacted United costumer service, The person I told my story to on the phone said “Thats unfortunate we have an agreement with American and should have been able to get you on that flight.” They told me how to online apply for compensation, so I submitted my claim. The person who responded to my claim said they could refund the unused portion of the ticket to Los Angeles but they could not refund the flight we had purchased on our own. So in summary on the day of the flight United was unable to get my boys where they were supposed to and said they couldn't get them there for 2 days. We were able to find a flight that salvaged part of the trip on an airline United had access to. Then they refused to reimburse me for booking the flight they should have found themselves. I am extremely disappointed in Uniteds lack of effort in trying to get my boys where they were scheduled to be. I am also extremely disappointed in their customer service response to my request for fair compensation.";NEGATIVE

On our last leg of our flight from Houston to Vancouver, the incoming flight was delayed.

Overall, a very pleasant experience with United.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-02-10;"When I looked at this United Airlines flight this morning it was pretty empty which always worries me. The airlines do not like this. Sure enough, when I arrived I saw that they added additional flights from other airlines to this one to fill it up. Delayed due to aircraft arrival they said. First delay was 45min, then an additional 45 mins. They told us it was due to severe weather in Eugene, OR for this second delay. I looked it up, no delays in that area at all, no weather. Then came the second delay, another 45mins! And I checked the seating chart, now almost full. Just another episode of the airlines not caring about anyone else's schedules but their own. Last month they outright canceled my husbands early fight sometime middle of the night from a smaller airport. It was not full either and I'm sure they couldn't do this same trick due to location. No other flights available either. I will be looking at other airlines but do not have much faith in any these days.";NEGATIVE

On the return flight we was served dinner at 9pm USA time and 2am UK time. The lights in the cabin were left on until 11pm USA time (4am UK time), and were turned back on 2 hours later.

When serving drinks she called everyone by name which I've never had happen before. She also helped by lifting the arm on my seat to make me more comfortable.

Ground staff were not well trained and couldn't really help to appropriately re-book my flight. When the first flight was canceled on my outgoing flight the next option would have been to either fly two days later from the same airport or 1 day later from another airport (which cost me $100 to get to). On my return journey, the first flight was cancelled again. They tried to book me onto a Delta flight but didn't manager to transfer my passenger information, so I missed the flight. They then rebooked me onto a 12 hours trip from Kansas to Texas to NYC to Rhode Island (original trip time was 6 hours). I had a 4 hours layover in Houston, TX when I went to the United Airlines service desk to ask for any shorter options. They told me that I wasn't even on my next flight anymore because the NYC to Rhode Island flight was cancelled. Nobody told me that, I just found out by accident. They finally put me on a direct flight from Houston to Boston (which meant another $100 bill for the taxi to Rhode Island. Very poor customer service.";NEGATIVE

I refused all offers until eventually they relented and a few customers took up offers of $400 and a re-scheduled flight. On the plane it was evident that there were empty seats (premium and business) - so they would rather fly with empty seats and pay people not to fly!";NEGATIVE

We were supposed to leave at 11.15am but were told it wouldn't be until 5.15pm - but then we suddenly boarded at 3.15pm without the departures board changing from 5.15pm. The crew was grumpy and on several occasions one of the stewards raised his voice in annoyance at an older man who spoke Chinese and was having trouble with his entertainment system. My inflight entertainment was unresponsive unless I jabbed very hard at the screen (which I wasn't going to do because there was someone sitting in front of me trying to sleep). They restarted the system but it did not help. And I was told condescendingly that I was just pressing too many time and the screen was freezing. I was purposely pressing the touchscreen slowly once and waiting and waiting. But they couldn't be bothered to assist me. Seats were uncomfortable. I did not like the food. Usually I like airline food. The chicken rice dish was watery and goopy. I definitely would not recommend flying United Airlines.;NEGATIVE

Because it is a 12 hours flight, they made sure that I got my seating arrangements so I was comfortable and had space on the flight which I appreciated. The Dreamliner aircraft was new and sophisticated. I loved the window panel control shade device. The entertainment systems was excellent and provided good choices of movies and entertainment for old and young. Even the safety video was new and fresh from the traditional types I have seen. I have mixed feelings on the cabin crew. I was seated on 23L. There were 3 Crews working on that row.

We ended up flying to another destination and arranged ground transportation home at added time and expense.

Our flight delayed and no staff was around to help answer or inform us the flight status. Later on after I landed in Lihue I went through my messages and noticed there was an email notification about the flight change. I guess electronic messages is the new customer services?  I had a 5hr flight from SDF to Denver and 7hrs flight from Denver to Lihue. The flight attendant showed up maybe twice for us to order our cold, horrible meal. No one else showed up after that to even collect the trash. Nor even to offer water. Myself and a lot of the passengers had to take our own trash to the bathroom. Fast forward to today - I had to extend my stay and I was told it will cost me a total of $600-$900 to change it. I paid $1200 for a round trip ticket and they are going to charge me $700 for fare differences and $200 change fee - and the funny part is that I can go and book the exact flight online for $345.00. It blows my mind on how this monkey business situation is operated. Now, I just booked my return ticket back with Alaska Airlines. ";NEGATIVE

This is a ""best of times/worst of times"" review about that experience with United Airlines from New Delhi, India to Newark. The bad side was that the United desk in New Delhi was very late in informing us of the cancellation. I, and many others, had cleared immigration/security before United told us. My wife, who was in the US, told me later she knew the flight was cancelled long before I did by watching the United website. This late notice left us stuck in the secure area. We had a long (2+ hours) wait before the staff was able to get us out of that area. The good side was the once United got organized they were very supportive in providing us free room and board in a 5 star hotel for as long as we needed. They provided comfortable transportation to and from the airport and the staff did everything they could to assist us.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-30;"What a disappointment. I regularly take United Airlines flight from Eugene to San Diego which connects in San Francisco. Typically there is only about 15 minutes to get to the connecting flight in SF before the plane takes off. Today, my dad took this same flight and has been waiting in the SF airport for 8 hours because the plane from Eugene was a few minutes late and the flight to San Diego left without him. Since United does not offer vouchers for ""weather related delays,""  my dad was pushed behind about 20 other people on standby to catch another flight to SD, even though he was one of the first people to be placed on standby because the other people apparently paid more for their tickets. What a joke! After not being able to catch 4 more flights out of SFO, he is still stranded. This trip was a gift for my dad to come and see me and now he has had to spend most of it sitting in SFO airport, watching other people on standby get on flights to SD before him because they paid more for their ticket. Why can't United Airlines partner with a ""sister"" airline, to accommodate these kinds of absurd incidents where their guests are left stranded at the airport? Also, why would United regularly plan for only 15 minutes to catch a connecting flight in San Francisco of all places - an airport that is famous for weather related issues? Used to be my favorite airline but after this fiasco, I'm so over them.";NEGATIVE

If you don't board your United flight 15 minutes prior to the scheduled departure you risk losing your seat to United staff members or someone else on standby.

It's for this reason that I take it so personally that United Airlines customer service has gotten so poor.  6 weeks ago I had to reschedule a flight due to a medical emergency. Rescheduling was no problem, and they handled the situation very quickly for me. I was supposed to receive a refund 10 days later. It never came. I've tried calling the past 2 days. Yesterday. Although I was on the line before closing time, as soon as closing time hit my call was dropped. Today, I waiting for 18 minutes just to have a rep ""transfer"" me to a dead line that said ""your call cannot be completed as dialed. Goodbye."" I'm now calling back a third time.

united-airlines;2016-01-17;"United Airlines is such a disorganized company, it would be comedic if I wasn't stuck at their gate. They've managed to ruin my flights twice in one trip. When laying over in Denver to Colorado Springs, they forgot our flight attendant at another airport!  After they couldn't find a replacement, they tried sending another plane to fetch us. Being delayed every hour on the hour (was only supposed to be a 30min flight), they cancelled our flight at 1230am, due to engine failure, with no compensation. An Air Force pilot was so generous to have stood up and announced he had rented a car to drive to COS and had three empty seats. He was not affiliated to UA, in any way, and had no obligation to us. This moment, I am on my way back to NJ, laying over in Chicago, and our flight has been delayed 2hrs, so far. Apparently, our plane needed maintenance and has been kept in the hangar. How can this happen twice in one trip? All I want is to get home safe and on time. Our new plane has just arrived at the gate, unlikely to leave even at the new delayed time, and the engines are smoking.  I just want to leave this airport, already. This is the worst traveling experience in my life and I used to fly with American Airlines. So, to anyone planning a trip in the future, just pay the few extra dollars for Delta. It would be well worth it. Also, please refrain from putting objects in the overhead compartment that will fit under the chair in front of you.

The United Airlines office in the Bogota airport was hard to find and the United staff were not helpful to deal with headaches caused by their airline. Similar on return flight, not very helpful and disputed office hours posted on the office door in the Bogota airport, they were nowhere to be found. My concern was the possibility of missing my connecting flight in the US due to their delays and the short layover they booked in Houston. Again, no one cared or tried to be helpful.

There was an unannounced gate change that was never updated in United's system. The only indication that we were boarding at a different gate was a paper sign hung by the new gate that said ""SF."" This resulted in several passengers boarding the plane late because they were at the wrong gate. Flight attendants allowed passengers to continue trading seats even after the flight was ready to depart. I understand trying to accommodate families that want to sit together, but once the plane is loaded we should have gotten on the road! Gate agents never asked anyone to gate check, but then (predictably) there wasn't enough overhead space for everyone's bag, so several passengers had to exit the plane, gate check, and re-board, which contributed to the flight delay. The flight itself was alright, but it was just ridiculous how poorly managed the boarding process was.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-16;"Philadelphia to San Francisco, and United Airlines boarding system is archaic and ridiculous. Don't pick an aisle seat or you will end up getting on last and there will be no overhead space for your bag.  When I was boarding, the Group 3, 4 and 5 lines were lined up for a long time since no one pays attention to this system knowing that they're going to get screwed if they try to get a bag in the overhead. I was a 5 and when our turn came, they suddenly announced that everyone (1/5 of the passengers) had to check their carry on bags at the counter because there was no overhead space available which caused complete chaos. After going through security and always getting x-rayed and patted down for no reason, facing this boarding madness feels like torture not to mention the long flight ahead. I did pay for the extra leg room but you get no priority boarding for that - you're just like the people who pay nothing extra. The crew look miserable and I can't say I blame them and the passengers seem sullen and depressed after the regimen they've been through. If companies like United Airlines want to encourage repeat business, they're going to have to realize that you can't treat people like animals and sometimes you might want to give them something to comfort their stress in flying - not even peanuts - they're so cheap.

I don't know why it wasn't there before the flight. During our ""wait"", we were offered drinks soon after boarding, and then for the rest of the hour, flight attendants spent their time in the galley, laughing, having a good old time. Not once did anyone check on passengers, at least in the front of the aircraft. On our return trip, which went from Dallas to Chicago, when meals were brought to us, first my son, who doesn't drink, was served a beer, then was served the wrong meal. The attendant was very apologetic, and was really nice, but this seems to be an ongoing problem with United. Service is definitely lacking. As far as the aircraft, they are aging planes, with little in ammenities, like wi-fi, or even power outlets for cels, or laptops. I know these problems seem petty, but I usually fly in first class,and have come to expect better service for the extra money that it cost, but this didn't even come close to other airlines.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-14;"My husband injured his back the night before our United Airlines trip from Boston to Maui. We arrived at the airport with him in a wheelchair. We were ushered to the gate by an airport representative - all was well. We had forgotten we booked exit row seats and the gate agents didn't realize the issue until we were boarding. We were in row 7, and I completely understand that, with my husband's injury, we could not remain in the exit row. What I am taking issue with is the manner in which the agents handled moving us. They made an announcement over the PA and offered our seats to the entire plane. All they asked was that 2 people sitting together exchange seats with us. We paid over $100 each to be in those seats and, at most, the seats should have been offered to other passengers in EconomyPlus seating. Instead, the PA announcement caused mayhem at the gate with many people rushing the counter. Our seats were exchanged for two seats in row 27. So, my husband was rolled to the plane in a wheelchair and then had to almost crawl to row 27. They could have offered the seats to passengers in row 8, for example - at least for starters. Seems as though this would make the ADA shiver. Once the agents realized we had to be moved out of the exit row, we became an annoyance to them. This is a huge fail on the part of United. To add insult to injury, once everyone was onboard, an announcement about the availability of economy seats was made! So, I hit the flight attendant call button, explained what happened and was told we could not move - that there really weren't any seats.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-14;"I decided to start flying a lot more than I had before in the past and I chose United Airlines due to their credit card rewards and prices of the flights. I will give credit for one thing, the mobile app is amazing and saves a lot of time. I have been on quite a few flights and had some minor complaints but nothing big enough for me to ever voice or make me want to change airlines. Well, that has changed. I flew with United Airlines from Little Rock to Dallas to San Diego to San Francisco to Las Vegas to Houston and back to Little Rock this month. On my flight to Vegas I noticed there were a ton of extra seats in the front, the flight might've been half full at most. So I asked the flight attendant before boarding if I was able to move up seeing as I flew with often and I wasn't feeling well. She flat out lied to me and said ""those seats are reserved for employees tonight"". I had absolutely no problem with that and told her I completely understood. Well, I was seated by 2 men on the flight to Vegas and at take off all of those seats were empty. That flight attendant was onboard serving everyone but the other seats that were supposedly ""taken by employees"" weren't actually taken. I was appalled that she had the adauctity to lie to my face. Also, another problem is the $75 same day change fee. I changed my flight that day to a later departure time and it cost me $75 to do that even though the flight wasn't even close to full. Needless to say, I'm changing airlines and do not plan on flying with United again. Southwest is doing it right with their no change fee, might want to look into that.";NEGATIVE

I had to call back, the person that made my reservations, entered my lastname as both my first and last name (another 45 mins on the phone). Then my original booking got changed without notification. I was originally to be routed thru Houston and got routed to Dulles in DC. Then my flight got cancelled while I was in DC, due to weather, which is understandable. The customer service was a very pathetic attempt at customer service. I waited in line for over 2 hours, and there were only 25 people in line in front of me. I was told that there were no flights out to L.A. til 2 days later and that United would pay for 3/4 of a 200+ a night hotel, that was their hotel of choice, I was told they wouldn't pay for anything else. After telling them that was not acceptable, and fly me back home, the person next to her found a flight to LAX for a person behind me in line and I was still stuck in DC. The customer service agent then found a flight out to San Francisco, so I took that flight, because I wanted out of the airport after being there all day. Since San Francisco was not my original destination city, I had to take a Greyhound from San Francisco to Los Angeles. I lost 2 complete days due to travel, between cancellation and not getting a correct flight. This also caused for more money out of pocket to get me to the correct location. I don't understand how they hadn't planned for something, since the plane was coming from Chicago, and it is winter. I was just very disappointed with my whole experience with United. Seating was not designed for people of taller stature, I am 6 foot tall with an athletic build, and could not sit comfortably on any of my flights.

When we got to Santa Fee, we 'lost' our checked-in box of edible stuff! We had to spend 2 days tracking the package, and American Airlines was the replacement airline to get our package from Denver to Santa Fe. SO it was an American Airlines employee who went beyond her duty to take copious notes and actually contacted the tracking office in Santa Fee. All Lost Luggage calls to the tracking office (outsourced as usual and the agents were not able to help us except to say they could only do their best) produced no results. We travelled on Wednesday December 16 and finally got the package on Friday December 18 by which time some of the food stuff had gone off. Then on our return flight on January 8, 2016, our flights were all delayed, starting from Santa Fee and at Denver, it was a nightmare for my mother and I. She needed wheelchair assistance and we had to request for it twice because the gates got changed, like 5 minutes we were dumped at the first gate. At the second gate, we were advised on the Departure screens that the gate was now somewhere else, even further from the original gate. In the end, my mother got fed up and walked to the last gate where we finally got a rep who was very professional and patient. The information on the Departure screen was confusing as both United and Air Canada were shown to be departing at the same gate but with 5 minutes difference. The flight was delayed by 4 hours and instead of getting into Toronto at a reasonable hour of 10.30 pm on Jan 8, we only got home at 3 am!

united-airlines;2016-01-12;"Pleasantly surprised at how well this Los Angeles to Melbourne flight was, given the length (15 hours) and the reputation of United Airlines. The Boeing 787-9 we flew in was a new aircraft, the cabin does feel airier, with larger windows, and improved lighting. The cabin crew on this flight was a mix bag of very senior flight attendants who were quite stand off-ish, to younger flight attendants who were very nice, attentive and friendly. United has upped its game in catering for the Business First cabin and it shows. Portions were plentiful, wines good, and choices good. The mid-flight snacks left on the credenza at the forward most section of the cabin and in the mid-Business cabin galley were basic and not great, but not an issue, given the large dinner service. Breakfast was served 90 minutes out of Melbourne. Flight departed on time and arrived 30-35 minutes ahead of schedule. If United can replicate the service and feel of the 787-9 to its other aircraft cabins on long haul flights, then it might have turned a corner. The LAX terminal it operates from is dingy, dirty, and has zero to offer in terms of comfort. It is supposed to be upgraded. Not soon enough. WIFI on board the plane, at $19.99 is a relative bargain and worked extremely reliably, for the entire duration of the flight. Sleep quality also quite decent.";POSITIVE

This took place for 7 hours and finally at 4pm, United cancelled the flight. Hours later we got an e-mail saying they booked us on a flight the next day, leaving us to miss our son’s graduation. So at that point, we might as well of gone home. Determined not to miss it, we booked a rental car and planned to drive all night to make it. Thankfully my wife found a flight on Southwest and we made it in time.  Today I received an e-mail saying we would be receiving a $150.00 credit for each of us to use on a future flight, with United of course.

The two United Airlines agents helped me get my boarding pass quickly and check my baggage regardless. I was sprinting towards the gate and had dropped my boarding pass. The employee working at the gate waved me on and told me my seat number in a friendly manner. I arrived in Newark and my bags made it on the plane. I was so thrilled with the customer service I received and the attitude of the employees.";POSITIVE

I heard rumors which almost got me to book with a different airline, but the price was good enough to push on.

Overall I would fly this airline again, very comfortable.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-09;"United Airlines from Seattle to Washington DCA. I didn't know until the night before my flight that I couldn't bring a carry-on item (I had a backpack and a laptop bag, nothing bulky). I was rushing to the airport. Thought I could just pay a small fee but at the desk I believe the cost was $50. $50 for a laptop bag?! I ended up barely shoving the laptop bag into my backpack which was bulging and jammed it under my seat, making it impossible to open the backpack. All the while, the overhead space was almost empty and gone to waste. As soon as I sat down, I heard 3+ announcements about ensuring personal items fit under the seat in front of you, which was obnoxious and draconian. Seats were mediocre in terms of comfort. Then, I began watching the little TV screen. But 30 minutes in, the show I was watching froze and I was asked to pay to continue watching (well, that's lovely). And lastly, there was no complimentary beverage. Not even free waters were offered (evidently you had to specifically ask for a cup of water if need be). Absolute worst airline I have flown with. Only benefit was that it was slightly cheaper than other airlines, but still not worth it.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-09;"San Francisco to Chicago. When you pay $95 annually for a Mileage Plus Explorer credit card, you're supposed to get one free checked bag for flights purchased using the Mileage Plus card. Don't believe it! When United changed the credit card number because that card was apparently compromised, United refused to allow one free checked bag, because the credit card we had at the airport did not match the card used to purchase the tickets (which had since been cancelled). It's a sneaky way for United to get an extra $50, but it's also a clear violation of its policy. ";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2016-01-07;"United Airlines from London to Orlando return via Washington Dulles. Flight from London was prompt, seats allocated at check in. On getting to Washington, our flight to Orlando was delayed by 5 hours! Unbelievable. To add insult to the injury, the airline did not even announce the reason nor did they apologise. Rather, the announcement was for volunteers to check in their hand luggage as the plane was completely overbooked. They also requested for volunteers who would offer up their seat since they oversold ticket! The flight back from Orlando was much more horrible, flight was delayed from MCO and this almost impacted on the connecting flight at Washington. No seats were allocated at check in, we had to wait and wait as they kept increasing the duration of the delay of the first leg of my journey. Went to the customer service who didn’t deem it fit to apologise, but said there should still be 40 mins for the connection and she can’t promise there won’t be any further delays. Plane arrived eventually and we now fell on another queue at the boarding gate to get checked in for seat allocation. This delayed the flight much longer. So in all, we had to thrash the first boarding pass given at check in without seats, and got another boarding pass by the boarding gate. On landing at Washington, we had to race out of the aircraft and onto the other gate as there was no plan for the plane to wait and we couldn’t afford to miss the flight as there was no other flight to London by United. And we still had to obtain another boarding pass with seats at the boarding gate. They were unable to sit us together because the attendant said she has been calling our names and we were not there. ‘How would we be there when our first leg was delayed?’ was my question, she works with United Airlines and should have seen that the first aircraft hadn’t arrived. So she almost gave our seats out if not that we were lucky to have reached the boarding gate within the few minutes prior to departure. With the horrible customer service experience, it was obvious those guys can leave us unattended if the plane had left for London. Flight attendants were horrible, attended to us as if they were told to go fight on the plane. ";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2016-01-06;"This review pertains to the Customer Service Reps at the United Airlines counter in Omaha. I realize that when a flight gets cancelled, the result is usually panic, confusion and frustration. However, being in customer service, I felt that there are other ways of alleviating the stress of their customers. While I was in line for over an hour, I watched one rep point and yell at the customers, one after another. I overhead her tell people that she's heard it all, vacations, family gatherings, job responsibilities. She showed absolutely no empathy for any of the customers with their concerns. She didn't refrain from just yelling at customers, she shared the same love with the employees. ""I only have 2 hands, you'll have to figure it out on your own"". I felt so bad for everyone that experienced the ""help"" of this woman. This woman was the supervisor! It's a wonder why the other employees didn't feel the need to provide good customer service. It was simply, the flight is cancelled, we can get you there on the 2nd. That wasn't an option for us and they didn't provide any other solutions. Except another rep did suggest that we take the Amtrak down to Texas to catch our connecting flight. After hours of sitting in the airport trying to come up with a solution. We thought, how about driving to Denver? So we reluctantly went back to the counter to inquire on flights. Thankfully! We spoke with a male agent who was efficient and polite as possible, he booked our flight with a smile. It was reassuring that he took the time to explain to us the procedure. We left knowing that we had another option. Ironically, while waiting in line for our confirmation, I saw the supervisor walk by with a smile! However, the smile was because she was criticizing someone for duct taping the top of a water bottle. She was shaking her head and name calling. But from afar, one would think she actually liked her job. I am hesitant to ever fly United again. Constant cancellations and delays. According to Supervisor lady, it's always due to weather. When in actuality, it was due to the fact that they had no crew due to the 8 hours wait time. If they weren't short staffed, the weather excuse would not exist. And Supervisor lady would have to come up with another reason to point and yell at people.";NEGATIVE

After 1 hour 45 minutes, we finally got boarding passes. The food from Dubai was less than good, but the main issue was the lack of food. 16 hours inflight, we were fed at hour one, and again at hour 14.5hrs -  the ""snack"" offered was a tiny gross sandwich. We were totally unsatisfied by the offerings. Never have I been so hungry on a flight. To add to that, on the Washington to Dubai flight all food offerings inflight were spicy, and not a single pre-order meal was acceptable for a vegetarian child!";NEGATIVE

Boarding was swift and even though we left with about a 20 minute delay, the pilot managed to land in Chicago about 15 minutes ahead of schedule. The service offered in economy met expectations, and the service went by without any incident. The plane was almost completely full so it was a loud trip but nothing United can be blamed for. The only minor complaint was that they started handing out the immigration papers quite late in the flight which led to some stress, but otherwise it was a solid performance. Credit is given where credit is due and United certainly deserves credit for this well structured and good flight.";POSITIVE

United managed to screw up the most basic thing - scheduled 2 flights on the same gate with one aircraft. By the time they resolved the issue, I missed my connection in SFO and had to get the next flight which was 4 hours later. The worse thing is the United Airlne employees acted as if it was our problem to figure out how to get to our destination. It was just horribly frustrated. It was no better on the trip back to Seattle. The flight from Phoenix to SFO was 75 minutes late and the flight SFO to Seatte was 90 minutes late. The whole trip was a nightmare. I don't usually write review, but this unpleasant experience with UA was so significant that I thought I should share. It is no wonder that UA ranks the worst in customer satisfaction.

united-airlines;2016-01-04;"Flew return flights from Birmingham (UK) to Newark in December 2015 with United Airlines. Plane was 1 hour delayed leaving Birmingham due to issues with luggage being stored in the hold however no announcement was made by the crew until 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. The cabin crew on the way to Newark were rude and lacked basic customer service skills, even a smile and eye contact seemed to much. Rather than offer drinks, the trolley was swiftly marched down the aisle not stopping unless you caught their attention. My entertainment screen was also broken when I asked one of the female crew members to look if anything could be done I was told no and she wouldn't do anything. I understand it wasn't the end of the world as I had a book and my iPod but found her response unhelpful. Food was okay for airline standards and seats had a reasonable amount of legroom although we had upgraded to premium economy. On our return journey I was shocked at the rudeness of the staff at check in, we were using the self check-in system at Newark which I found clever and fast however the United Airlines attendant assisting passengers showed some of the poorest customer service I had ever seen, I'd advise not to ask for any help at this stage to anyone using the United Airlines Self Check in at Newark. The overnight flight back to Birmingham though was far more pleasant, it shows the difference a nice crew can make to your journey. Overall I wasn't massively impressed with United Airlines and probably would not use them again if it came to it. It's a shame the efforts of some staff members are overshadowed by others.";NEGATIVE

At 30 min. before the departure we got a text that the flight was 'cancelled' - raced to Customer service along with every other passenger on the full flight, only to find no reps there yet - even though we were the second person in line, the rep said that 'we can't get you there til January 1st Friday"". And our return was Saturday -  sounds phenomenal. Then she proceeded to tell us that the plan never arrived from its previous location----yet 30 min. before departure they were listing it as 'on time'. Waiting on the 'full refunds' they promised us - not holding my breath. As an aside, I have to laugh at the absurd sales pitches their FAs give regarding their 'new improved IFE system"". If you like watching a movie on your cell phone or want to schlepp a laptop along, you'll love it. If you don't, you're just out of luck. Our CLE-LAS flight stated it had NO IFE at all.

First my daughter was partially at fault for getting Starbucks so close to departure, but we all had boarding passes and were at the gate 15-20 min before takeoff. The family had already boarded and they decided my daughter and another minor should have arrived sooner, held them back and gave the seats to non-revs. Our daughter called and alerted us so we deplaned and were held at the end of the jetway. A manager came down to speak with my wife who was beside herself saying ""You can't leave us on the plane and make our child stay behind alone."" The manager's response: ""Mam, we'd leave a 3 year old behind!"" Luckily another passenger was commenting on how bad the gate agent was treating our daughter when an Attendant overheard and told the Captain he needs to make it right, which he did by ordering a non-rev off the plane and my daughter onboard. Continental Airlines never treated customers this was. They are truly missed. The flight crew was awesome by the way, but I have to give a low rating because of the Gate Agents and Manager.

They did inform us promptly and were put into a hotel for the night and flew us out the next day. We were given a photocopied sheet of instructions of our rights and how to claim back compensation, but when we followed the web address, it led us to a feedback sheet which was had to be submitted online and there was nowhere to file a complaint via email. When we got home, we searched the United web site and there is no complaint department which I find shocking. We have searched high and low for help and advise on how to proceed. We have found nothing but negative feedback especially about United appearing to shirk their responsibilities when things go wrong. The flight itself was ok - but only ok. The cabin crew ranged from lovely to rude (one female crew member was incredibly angry towards me when she tripped over my sleeping husbands leg which had crept out into the aisle area). I thought the food was nice for aircraft grub and they did give a complimentary glass of wine. The plane was rather shabby - a length of trim came off the overhead locker and the crew struggled to stow it and a trim panel in the toilet came away completely when I pulled off a piece of toilet tissue. A large section of the plane was left without their entertainment screens which could not be fixed, and I was unable to connect to the inflight entertainment even though I had downloaded their app before the flight as instructed. Whilst I appreciate these things are not safety related, it did not inspire confidence in their maintenance programme.

united-airlines;2016-01-03;"Gunnison to Austin via Houston. On this particular trip we flew economy plus. Our flights were delayed due to weather, with which I have no issues. It was when we got to Houston that we ran into issues. We got on our plane, backed out of the gate and then proceeded to sit on the runway for two hours. The pilot announced that he was attempting to leave to Austin before his allowed flying hours terminated, but was stopped and declared an illegal flight instead. Thus, there were no gates for us to return to. I do want to say the flight attendants were more than accommodating, but with two children under the age of 3 with us, sitting on the runway was a nightmare. When we finally got to the gate, our flight had been cancelled. So, as we deplaned, a United rep. was waiting at the gate handing out customer service number cards. She was rude and not willing to answer any questions, including: how do we get our luggage? She made no eye contact and would answer us in short, irritated responses. At the very least, United could have instructed a more sympathetic employee to stand at the gate while we deplaned. This was the beginning of customer service at its worst. The customer service line was packed, so we decided to rent a car in order to drive back to Austin, without any help or recommendations from United. The next step was to figure out how to get our baggage, and on 5 different attempts we waited on hold for assistance for two hours each, even with the Gold Member extension. When we finally were able to get an answer, we were told that our baggage would not be delivered to our home because the flight was cancelled due to bad weather, which we know not to be true due to what our pilot said to us (as stated above), and in the fact that flights were taking off around us while we were waiting on the tarmac. Moreover, on our drive to Austin, we did not have a single drop of rain, nor did we see any storms or feel any wind. That being said, all could have been forgiven if the United reps were more patient, United was a little more honest, we had a quicker answer, and United was willing to bend a little when it came to getting us our baggage (which meant an extra hour trip for us to the Austin airport to pick up our luggage). Ultimately, our greatest disappointment was in the lack of care in customer service.";NEGATIVE

I was fortunate enough to quickly rebook online with my phone and was on standby for the next flight. I can't say the same for the other 100 people, which had to wait until after New Years to get a flight out. As I waited for the next flight on standby in hopes of a seat, I find that they have overbooked the flight by 17 people. A family of 7 who had planned a trip to Cancun could not make it there to enjoy the vacation. Even Frontier is better than United, and it's a fraction of the price. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2016-01-02;"San Diego to Detroit via Houston. This was the return leg of the trip we started on December 25th. Of the 4 legs we had, only 1 leg was our family of 5 kept together. Usually my youngest minor child (13) was placed somewhere else on the plane apart from the rest of the family. Having purchased these tickets in February 2015, I find it very hard to believe that the flight was so full at the time of purchase that my family couldn't be kept together. United had my $3000 for 10 months before the flight as I paid at the time of booking. Then, when we arrive in Houston 18 minutes early,we sit on the runway waiting for our gate to be cleared. Then when the gate gets cleared 10 minutes later, they decide to change gates. What should have been a 1 hour layover is now down to a race to go from terminal c to terminal b. We double check the Airport Board to make sure we have the right gate and that the plane is on time. We do, and it says it is. We race to B76 and stand there. And stand there. Finally 10 minutes after we were supposed to start boarding we are told that the flight is delayed because they are short 1 Flight Attendant. 10 minutes later we are told the Flight Attendant for our flight called off sick, after we were told that the flight attendant was on the ground. This process continued for almost 2 hours, while they ""searched"" for a flight attendant. The time was continually bumped by 15 minutes, then a half hour, never really allowing any of us an opportunity to go get food, even though many of us had not eaten since breakfast. On top of all this, I was originally scheduled to go from San Diego to Chicago to Detroit, and the airline changed my flight without my knowledge 2 days before we departed. Because of the airlines delay I was forced to rent a car in Detroit as my arranged transportation couldn't meet us after a 2 hour delay. This cost me an additional $100 as it was a last minute car rental on a holiday. I find the lack of customer service, the unfriendly seating of a family of 5 in 3 different sections of the plane to be unsatisfactory.

As a final good note, my checked bag was the first one to come out in baggage claim which showed the small attention to details to people flying in business class.

Having pushed back from the gate we were told that a fuel pump had failed so rather than return to the gate and let us wait for the repairs in the lounge they parked us on a stand away from the terminal (Cheaper that way). Two hours later we finally left Birmingham. We noticed a 'Check Pilot' leave the flight deck to sit behind us for the flight to Newark. As we approached Newark the 'Check Pilot' re-entered the flight deck. He must have made either the Captain or First Officer nervous because we came in way too high and had to abort the landing, so around we went again by which time we had no chance of catching our flight to Orlando. The Captain informed us that the aborted landing was due to 'wind'. Yeh right, don't insult your passengers intelligence! On the ground we went to the United desk to get seats on the next flight down to Orlando. Desk clerk informed us that although we had four 'first class' seats booked and paid for, there were only three first class seats available, therefore one of the party would have to take a seat in 'coach'. OK these thing happen but we would obviously get a refund of the difference (about $250). That was in March 2015 - we made the claim in April 2015 on our return to the UK. Our travel agent received an offer from United of $100 and chose to make up the difference because of the trade we give him. We are still waiting for the refund from United! I travelled regularly between Birmingham UK and Jacksonville FL when the company was Continental with no problems. Since United have taken over, the airline is a disgrace.

I make an enormous effort not to fly any US carriers when I travel because the inflight experience is on average materially worse than virtually any other airline I know of. United however takes the cake as the worst. The reason I write this review is not because we were stranded overnight somewhere or held up on a tarmac for hours on end. I write this review because of the simple, every day occasions where United flight attendants and staff make flying unpleasant. On one flight, I sat with my sleeping daughter in my lap, call light on, for about 20 mins just to request a cup of water. I finally get the attention of a flight attendant, and she boldly waves me off and never comes to offer assistance. On my last flight, the flight attendant was so impolite at my request for 3 beverages between my daughter and me, I wondered if she was personally bearing the cost of the drinks. Today, I'm connecting through Chicago, and my minor daughter and I are not sitting together. At bag check in, they couldn't reseat me. And at the gate, I swear the steward took pleasure in not being able to do anything to reassign our seats. Instead of offering apologies, he blankly stared at me and repeated - word for word - a useless statement that I'd have to ask for assistance on board. Not only did this leave my 6 year old daughter crying, but after asking 4 people already, I'm to believe that the crew on board are going to do anything? It seems reasonable that United Airlines should be able to ensure children aren't flying alone. but even if they can't, you'd think their staff might not be so put out by their own jobs that they're wholly insensitive to the distress they're causing passengers. If anyone at United - or more importantly, the unions - is reading this review, it might help to prepare your employees for a career in public relations, or perhaps train them in being less hostile to paying customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-12-30;"I was travelling from Tokyo Haneda to Pittsburgh, and I'm giving this review because of the way United Airlines handled its business in light of a few storms that made travel difficult. They people need to plan better for who is going to be available to assist with bad weather operations. In Las Angeles I had a delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flight. I know its the winter months. A lot of people traveling and some potential for delays. However I plan for that. Something United Airlines failed to do. When I learned my flight was delayed and I would miss my connection, I went to the service desk. The line had about 30 people who were having the same issue. The two women working behind the desk were assisting about 1 person every 40 minutes. I'm sure you can do the math on how long this process took. Why United Airlines couldn't have more than 2 people working during the busiest months of the year when you're charging that much for a flight is beyond me. The only thing keeping United Airlines going is lack of choices. Also after being hung up on by your help desk, if I could help it I'd never fly with United again.";NEGATIVE

Friendly welcome by FA when getting on plane, and at least 2 food and beverage runs, plus additional water and coffee runs, done in a professional and often friendly manner. While there were several vegetarian options, wish there was a veggie breakfast wrap or bowl offered. Economy Plus seat had plenty of leg room, but I'm not a big fan of the vinyl/leather seats, which got to be uncomfortable on 5+ hour flight. Didn't pay the $7.99 for AVOD - wish it was free, but somewhere over the Rockies regretted my decision and wished I had to make the flight go faster (God forbid I should have to read a book for 5 hours). Bathroom in back of the plane was ok, but sink of one of them was out of order and covered by tape, and an insufficient number of handiwipe packets were strewn on the counter (would have been good to have them in a bowl and more of them). Departed a few minutes late, but arrived about 15 minutes early. Overall a good flight.";POSITIVE

We were told not to worry, that we would be sure there would be time to connect. Watching the time in the air, we were late to land and rushed off the airplane. We consulted with an airline assistant and she assured us the plane was still here and directed us to a gate change. When we arrived, there was no record of a flight change and headed to customer service. We were then told the flight already left and we would be on the next flight at 6am : they rebooked us on a flight to Tampa (where we would have to rent a car and drive to ft Myers). We boarded the flight to Tampa, waited 40 minutes on the plane when a voice came on the speaker and alerted us that the flight had been canceled. There was no pilot to fly the plane. We were told to go again to customer service or we could call. We called and again, a representative confirmed we would be on the next flight to Tampa so we slept in the airport, on the floor, me being pregnant and traveling with my 2 year old only to find out when the attendant arrived that we were not on the flight. So here we sit, not knowing where we are going, stuck in Newark. Not one United Airlines employee has been able to give us accurate information to help us or get us where we need to go. I'm very frustrated and do not wish this fiasco on anyone.";NEGATIVE

Then when we got to LAX we were told our connecting flight UA480 was also delayed until midnight 11:55pm. We waited, and around 12:30am we were notified the flight was cancelled. The next flight that was available was on Wednesday, December 30th. That's is two whole days later. We were not offered any hotel accommodations and we had no choice but to rent a car because my wife had a medical appointment (that was scheduled during our trip) that she could not miss. It was very disappointing because we waited a long time to find out the flight was cancelled. Had they told us earlier we could have found other alternatives of getting to SFO faster. Not to mention, we had no other option but to seek alternative expenses requiring us to make an additional expenses such as car rental, food, gas, and additional long term parking fees at SFO because United Airlines failed to notify us about the cancellation in a timely manner. We were not giving clear information about the refund process, they simply told us to go online and submit a request. It was the worst experience ever. I will never fly though United Airlines again. I do not recommend it to anyone. The Wi-Fi was not available either from Cancun to LAX";NEGATIVE

This is for an upcoming flight. I had booked weeks before with a seat assignment for 2 people. As though it was a class magical act, the seat assignments disappeared. I attempted to receive an assigned seat and could not do so. We paid over $1000 for these seats and the UAL agent and supervisor could not, or would not, assign a seat. We are told we cannot get a seat assignment unless it is the day of departure from the airport. Unless you want to pay an extra $209 for an Economy Plus Seat.

The flight to Houston was delayed to 1pm because apparently the crew never showed up and the weather was bad in Houston (that part is understandable). I was forced to wait for 6 hours at the gate. Inflight entertainment was mediocre at best, but the seat comfort was acceptable. Flight attendants were friendly so the entire experience wasn't ruined.

So here we are all of us stranded at the airport in Amsterdam, watching the target for boarding moving by the minute! The plane had maintenance issues and it got so long that the crew missed their working hours slot. That was the story until the 3pm delay, the funny thing is nobody knows here how to explain the further delay until 9pm. 12 hours late! I don't know why I did this to myself again. Last trip with United Airlines had been a mess as well, looking at the conditions of those old 757 planes it's a miracle they don't have more issues.";NEGATIVE

I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance, everything was going great, I was supposed to be taking a red-eye flight and arriving in beautiful, sunny Cancun when I woke up. That was until one of the staff members announced that the flight has been canceled and it has been a downward spiral ever since. I don't even know where to begin. Let's see - the flight was canceled and not even rescheduled. I have been on hold for 2 hours waiting for a customer service representative from United to answer. Then the call got disconnected, and now I am on hold yet again, with estimated wait times of 60 minutes. I'm just overjoyed. But my personal favorite is the fact that even though the airplane never even left the airport, I am unable to get my luggage. It is almost 3am. I cannot get ahold of a representative, I cannot get my luggage, I was not offered any concessions for my inconvenience, and I cannot change my flight online. Word of advice - if you want to actually make it to your vacation and not spend your entire night in the airport terminal, fly with anyone else. Too bad there's no option for negative stars. Way to ruin my vacation.";NEGATIVE

The staff in Colorado Springs did a great job of re-routing everybody because we were all missing our connecting flights.

We tried to use our food voucher less than 24 hours later at the airport (the vouchers were supposed to be good for 2 days), but they were denied at airport restaurants.

Had to spend an extra 22 hours in Houston because that was the next available flight. Started off with a 30 minute delay in Mexico, which turned into a two hour delay. The original crew told us they were, ""not legal to fly"". So, they swapped out with a different crew. Forty five minutes later, that crew announces they are not the correct crew and that they are bringing the original crew back. We wait some more on the ground. We finally take off. When we get to Houston, we wait on the taxi way for an additional 15 minutes because our gate is blocked by equipment. Well we finally make it through customs, but our flight left 30 minutes ago. United had the audacity to tell a couple passengers that they will not refund their money or get them on a different flight because it was US customs that caused their missed flight. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-12-26;"It is common knowledge that United Airlines has slipped behind both American and delta on virtually all service parameters, but their PS service decline is especially alarming as it was the market leader for a few years. Took flight 497 from Newark to San Francisco on 25 December in business first and it was very disappointing. No amenity kits, flight attendants told other passengers that there was absolutely no food available during the 3+ hour gap after breakfast, although they stood in the galley eating snacks. For a good half hour after meal service the front galley was blocked by carts so both pilots could use the facilities and socialize with the flight attendants. All passengers finished eating and trays sat uncollected. Eventually someone had to ring call button and was told off and instructed to use economy bathroom. Both front cabin attendants were unfriendly and one openly hostile to passengers. Absolutely no contact with passengers for much of the flight. Have used the new transcontinental service of American Airlines and Delta and they are much better. This is all on top of shifting PS flights to Newark which is a chaotic mess - basically a cheap mall filled with poor signage and long lines. I had the impression that every passenger in the front cabin was unhappy.";NEGATIVE

First of all, they didn't let us purchase an upgrade to business class although the class was half empty. We paid $189 a seat for ""premium"", which was the biggest joke. The seat barely reclined. I've never ever been so uncomfortable during a flight. I couldn't lift up the armrests between me and my kids, the seats barely reclined and when they did, they wouldn't stay, and the width was smaller than normal. I am a regular international traveler and this is the last time I will fly with United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-12-25;"I have mixed feelings about United Airlines. The few upsides of the flight from San Francisco to Boston were the fact that it was direct, cheap, and punctual. Also, for some reason, I was able to use Wifi without paying. However, I was not impressed with the cabin service. We started off the flight with an announcement that there was something wrong with the plane, which is never good news to hear. My seat had a disgusting stain and felt like cardboard. There was no complementary dinner even though it was a night flight, and the price was very high. The inflight entertainment system was nonexistent, and the flight attendants did the safety introduction the old-fashioned way: acting it out in the front of the plane. Unfortunately, I was in the back. United is a so-so airline, one that should be avoided unless it's the cheapest or the most convenient. Other than that, I do not recommend it.";NEGATIVE

He was giving me the window seat behind me, but there was someone else seating there, and that person was being rudely moved from that seat, so I told the flight attendant that I would take the other seat instead, I don't need to be watching that drama. They should be a little bit more considerate, and respect people paying for their flights. Other thing I hated about that service is the fact that they charge for spirits, they shouldn't be charge because that's a 10 hour international flight.

The flight attendants look annoyed and rarely smile. Anytime you ask for something, you are greeted with a sigh and a look of discontent. Also, there is very little professionalism. A passenger a few seats ahead of me made a request to use the restroom before the seat beat light was turned off citing a medical concern and the flight attendant nearby repeated the medical issue out loud to another flight attendant so that everyone could hear it.

I usually fly Air France and one feels like they're in a fine dining restaurant. Not the case with United at all. It feels like a horrible diner. I ordered a gluten free meal, which typically is lovely on other flights but with United it's basically an economy meal. Worse, is that the hostess came over and showed me the tray and started unwrapping it and taking it apart. Not asking me but just saying ""What do you want me to do with this"".

One of these passengers included a woman with a baby, from whom the flight attendant grumpily took a purse and roughly shoved it into the overhead. There were no apologies from the flight attendant as we de-boarded, after another smaller delay as we waited for a free gate, and she was not pleasant toward anyone, from what I observed.

The employees who were trying to fix this problem, were nothing but rude and acted inconvienced at the fact that I didn't want my 1 year old sitting by herself 3 rows behind me. My husband and I were traveling with two small infants, one who was a lap child and the other had her own seat. For her seat we brought her car seat, which for a child her age (1) is a large seat. When we asked to board first in order to avoid hitting anyone on the head with the car seat we were met with rude responses about how it's not policy to let families board first, and that we should just be more careful while boarding. Policy or not you risk people getting injured by not letting us board prior. We are just asking to get situated so others are not inconvienced by our child's needs. We in fact waited to be the last off the planes for the same reason.

The flight to the states left in time and arrived early, which was great as I had only a two hour layover in LA before my flight to Mexico. The flight back was delayed slightly due to some undisclosed mechanical problem, but made up the time to arrive in Sydney only 15 min late. At LA, I was able to drop my bag off four hours before the departing flight which was great. The staff at check in at both ends were friendly and helpful. I booked via Expedia, requested an aisle seat and got this for four legs of the trio with no extra cost. My seat was no more or less comfortable than those on Etihad or Emirates.

When we explained the situation, the reps were very nice, they seemed to be working as quickly as possible and they got us on the earliest flight possible. The trip home: Our itinerary was SFO-Newark, NJ - Portland, ME. Our flight from SFO was delayed. We land in Newark and sprint to our gate with minutes to spare and were told ""that flight was cancelled"" and directed us to customer service. We wait in line for about 5 minutes before a rep states to the crowd, ""we are closing, you need to go to the other customer service line."" We wait for about 45 minutes in the new line. When we get to the counter, the rep asks how he can help us, I state, ""We'd just like the earliest flight to Portland, ME please"". He asks if we'd be willing to split up and we explain that we'd rather not. He suggests a flight to Boston. I tell him we have no way to Portland after that and he says to call family (it's past midnight). I say that's not an option, but the rep still pushed it. 5 minutes later he suggests a 10am flight for us, we ask for that and give him our boarding passes. He scans mine and says, ""so how were you planning on getting to Portland?"" I say, ""what do you mean? with that boarding pass I just gave you."" He explains that the flight was cancelled due to weather, which at this point we had known for hours. I say, ""yes, that's why we're trying to get on the 10a flight tomorrow."" He says that our flight ends in Newark. At this point my husband and I were extremely confused because our passes clearly stated Portland. He suggests a rental car. We sleep in the airport for a few hours and rent a car. He never gave us boarding passes, and almost lost my husbands baggage claim ticket. Our TA spent a long time going back and forth with United customer service. We were confirmed for a 6am flight, despite not receiving boarding passes. She tried to get them to refund us for our car but United stated that they ""don't reimburse for rental cars"". What they did was reimburse for our last leg ($45 each) and gave us each a $100 flight voucher to use within a year. We won't be using them again.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-12-07;"United Airlines staff at the airports and on the plane were polite and efficient. The smaller Embraer jets are nice for the single traveler, as they're designed with a single seat on the right side, so you get both window and aisle. The extra leg room in economy plus seating is worth the extra expense ($30-$45 on the segments I flew). The seats themselves are adequate, but not comfortable. This is an industry wide problem, and not in any way unique to United. The biggest disappointment is the WiFi service. From previous experience, it seems to work very well on their Airbus fleet. The Airbus fleet usually does not have tv screens in the seat backs, so the WiFi service on those planes comes with a library of movies and TV shows to watch. This works very well if you've got a tablet or some other device to watch them on. The Boeing portion of their fleet is another matter entirely. The more recent planes have the TV screens in the seats. There's a basic program that runs during the flight, but if you want to watch anything else, there's a fee. The WiFi service on the Boeing aircraft also seems to be spotty at best. It hasn't worked at all on 3 of the 4 segments I've flown in the last couple months. The Embraer planes fly the short routes. I have yet to come across one of these with WiFi service or a seat back screen. But, given the flights I've been on have only been about 90 minutes, this isn't a big problem. Bottom line: bring a tablet or small computer and download a couple of movies on it first.";POSITIVE

She said allowance was 50 pounds (ie 22.67Kg) and I had to remove 2 pounds before suitcase was accepted. She was totally disinterested when I informed her that I had travelled from the UK at 23Kg and why was that not accepted here in the USA to return to UK. All she could say ""2lbs must be removed"". I asked could I pay for excess and she said yes it would be 100 dollars and I agreed to pay. She then said no, it is 200 dollars and at this I said I would not pay for excess of 2lbs. I took my suitcase away, this I found to be embarrassing and removed excess. I was most upset to have to carry this 2lbs around with me all the way back to the UK.

DEN to PDX the wifi did not work again, but they were pushing to sell Direct TV. If the wifi did not work, then why would I take a chance of swiping my credit card to attempt to watch tv? The flight was delayed from MCI to DEN due to the plane setting overnight and frost had built up on the wings. Well, if you know it's 20 degrees outside and you have a 6am flight, would you not de-ice the plane before everyone boards to prevent delays? I almost missed my flight change from DEN to PDX because the flight was delayed due to frost. When I complained at PDX on my return part of the trip, I was told ""sorry, maybe it'll be better next time"" - seriously ""maybe"" was their best answer.

Although a long walk from check in, the lounge was very close to the boarding gate. Cabin crew were London based and were attentive on boarding and throughout the flight. Pushback delayed due to traffic at LHR, very windy and bumpy take off, and a long northerly route to avoid winds made us a little late into IAD.

No real problem in getting access from window seat over a reclined adjacent passenger. Food good both in quality and quantity - for mains I had a curried chicken breast, my wife a steak. Wine was offered with explanations, I chose the New World Pinot Noir. Water topped up often and so was the wine. Cheese course was generous, and ice cream was good. Entertainment was ok, plenty of films, decent screen size and sound quality. Bottle of water before lights out. Lavatories were cleaned and ok. Prelanding meal looked good - I only had fruit and a juice so didn’t partake. Landed at midfield terminal and so had to face the mobile lounges to get out to landside.

This almost happened the year before but I as his son was at the gate and finally got the United agents to board him when they were just about to close the door. In reporting this I telephoned United and finally got someone on the phone. They said I would have to talk to a CRO at the airport. I talked to 3 people at the airport terminal and they said I would have to talk to the CRO at the gate. I got to the gate and could not determine who was a CRO. I went to the gate (Terminal B gates 1-11) to ask the security United agent if this was the right gate. She tried to answer, but with a large amount of food in her mouth could not speak and was spitting it everywhere. Really good way for personnel to be. I finally got my father on the plane and went to the Customer Service Counter. Told I had to do things online as they management will not talk over the phone. One agent did say on the sly to contact the Federal agency over airlines for help. Another agent on the sly said they just don't have enough people working to help the volume of customers they have. It seems the staff working recognize the problems, but the airlines does not. If I had a better choice I would never fly United again and I have flown them back as far as the Continental days when they were a real service oriented airlines.

Over the months, United Airlines sent me a number of schedule changes and most were not an issues. However, the return flight from OGG to ORD via HNL has become a problem not only because they kept moving the time earlier and earlier (remember, I'm on vacation in Hawaii), but put us on Island Air which only offers economy class and charge for baggage ($80.00 for our 4 bags). This is unacceptable and in my opinion, quite unfair. I called UA's customer service and am so disappointed with the level of customer service or lack of that I received. The agent was difficult to understand due to her heavy accent and was in some ways, quite rude. Take or leave it attitude. Although she offered to move our flight to a different connection through LAX, she stated we would have to pay the difference since we upgraded to first class. How is this right? She told me that she couldn't do anything and when I explained that I have a 3.5 hour layover and that I would have to pay for bags, she didn't have any solutions for me. Rather she argued with me, told me she would talk to a supervisor, put me on hold only to come back and say that it was going to a considerable hold since her supervisor wasn't available and then continued to state she would be happy to cancel my flight altogether and refund me, but I would lose my upgrade that I used. Then she tells me that my husband's status means that we get one bag each checked free. I inquired how does this help me if I'm flying a different airline? She had no answer and again offered to cancel my tickets for a refund. How is this a solution? Her last solution was to call Island Air. Honestly, United Airlines used to be such a great airline - what has happened? Where did customer service go? What benefits do you get anymore for being loyal to an airline and actually paying to maintain a higher status (silver)? We are so disappointed. And I know that there is a very high chance that my comments will be ignored, as they have in the past when I have participated in surveys and given very honest answers with no care or response from United Airlines.

I always can get the upgrade while I use their upgrade coupon, such as American Airlines' Systems wide upgrade and Eva Air Upgrade coupons. I just had a trip on American Airlines and got upgraded while there is seat available with my systems upgrade coupon. United Airlines is not only limited certain class to use global upgrade, but also they charge big amount of money while they allow you to upgrade.

united-airlines;2015-11-29;"My wife and I booked flights from Dulles Airport to Addis Ababa via Frankfort and then returning through Paris with a layover of 6 days in Paris. The incompetence of United Airlines was evident from the outset - although we made our reservations at the same time to travel together, my wife and I were given separate confirmation numbers, which complicated any later transactions. We were told that our travel included 2 bags each with no charge, but we were charged for our second bags on each leg of the journey. Our flight from Addis Ababa to Paris was on the night of November 13, the night of the terrorist attacks in Paris. We attempted to change our date of flight to Paris, which was on United's partner Ethiopian Airlines. After 5 hours with a person in the US talking to United and a person in Ethiopia talking to Ethiopian Airlines, and after being told by each that any change had to be made through the other, we gave up on trying to make the change and instead purchased new tickets that ultimately brought us back through Frankfurt rather than Paris. United Airlines refused to refund the unused portion of our original tickets and even though we paid in full for the unused tickets, we cannot even get the miles added to our mileage plus accounts. In short, United Airlines has taken our money, was able to sell the seats again if there was a demand, and won't even award miles for the thousands we paid for the unused tickets. Even the email response to my refund request demonstrated the incompetence of United's employees, telling me ""Upon our investigation, the partially used ticket does not eligible to our Exception Policy. therefore, we are unable to refund."" Really? Even a form email cannot be stated in correct English? United Airlines has earned its poor rating as an airline and travelers should avoid it if at all possible.";NEGATIVE

Strange. The aircraft: well, if you can sleep during a flight and don't care about the inflight entertainment, you're fine. The monitor was so small and you could see so many pixels and in addition you could switch channels. But you could not stop your movie, so when you left your seat you missed part of your movie.

I was on a business flight from Tokyo to Chicago and we had a large number of US Marines coming from Guam to the US. The flight attendants over-served these men alcohol and didn't care if they were under age or not. They eventually became rowdy and then set up a gauntlet along the route to the bathrooms on the port side aft and were harassing women going to use the facility including using foul language and sexually explicit comments. I complained to one of the senior flight attendants and was met with hostility that I would say anything against the US Military and these (young men who she said were not doing anything wrong). I considered taping the event with my phone, but decided that if the people being harassed by drunk service men were not going to complain, then why should I. As I exited the aircraft after arrival in Chicago and was insulted with off the cuff comments by the attendant I complained to and her coworker. In Chicago, I had been denied early boarding even though I had a disability placard and was told by a really nasty desk attendant that prevented me from boarding that ""Anyone can get one of those anywhere"". I have always been treated horribly by service personnel at United especially in Chicago and all I have ever gotten with a million travel miles to my experience is a rude attitude from United.

We missed our connection from LA to Mexico City and were put on another flight. On the way home things really got bad. We had booked a flight from Mexico City to Melbourne with one connection in LA. We received an email from United saying they had changed our itinerary to Mexico City - Houston - LA - Melbourne, with no explanation. There were also very short transfer times in each airport. Of course, we missed our connection in Houston (where we were also instructed by United to pick up our bags and recheck them, which was ridiculous given the timeframe), and then were put onto another flight from Houston to LA, which gave us 20 minutes in LA to make our flight to Melbourne or else we would be stuck there for another day. When we asked if we would be provided with a hotel, we were told ""Sorry, none of this is our fault"".

The agent replied, ""Sir, this is our schedule. A short lay over in NY and then to Dallas International."" Dallas International? I lived in Dallas for many years, and always knew the airport as DFW/Dallas Ft. Worth. Are you talking about Dulles International (not Dallas) in Washington, DC? The United agent replied, ""Yes sir, of course."" I said, ""No thanks,"" and hung up the phone. I was seconds away from giving this United agent my credit card information for an incorrect flight because of his inability to understand English. Last week I again telephoned United and was again connected to an agent with less than perfect English speaking ability. I hung up the phone. When I spend hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, on a particular product I become more cautious. And when I have trouble communicating with a vendor about such products because of a language issue, then I become wary and concerned that my questions and/or instructions will be either misunderstood or ignored. Find another vendor. United needs to understand that it's employees become their public image. And employees that cannot communicate properly will give the public a bad impression of United.

So we get on the plane, fine we had a bit of delay still not angry except for the attendants with nasty attitudes!

Instead, UA provided free entertainment that pax can stream to their mobile device. While it's a great option, this isn't my preferred source of entertainment. Unfortunately, my flight ran into pretty bad weather while approaching IAH. This caused me to miss my connecting flight to MFE which happened to also be the last flight of the night on that route. Then, United Airlines surprised me. By the time I had landed, my flight had already been rebooked to the earliest available flight the next morning and I was given a hygiene kit. Because of the possibility of inclement weather the following morning, they had also placed me on standby on a later flight in case the first rebook was affected. UA staff was very polite, and actually did an amazing job at taking care of me while I was stuck in IAH. I also appreciate UA checking in during my travel to make sure I was okay, and to fulfill reasonable requests. At the end of the day, I was treated exceptionally well, especially considering the circumstances.";POSITIVE

I requested to find out what percentage of these travel certificates are actually redeemed and the airline informed me they do not share this information with the public or their customers.

When we got back to Chicago, they were able to provide hotel accommodation but rescheduled the flight for 8:00 a.m. which was quite irritating as we didn't arrive in Chicago until past midnight. To make matters worse, when I arrived at about 6:30 the next morning for flight, apparently would not be leaving until 5:00 p.m. because that was in fact earliest we could leave due to the open hours schedule of French border control. Is United Airlines seriously that inexperienced with international flights that they wouldn't have known this when rescheduling a flight, or at least would been able to check the aircraft properly before leaving Chicago the first time? They will definitely be my last choice in future international flights.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-15;"I had a lot of United frequent flyer mileage I had to burn off, and our 4 trips on United were absolute nightmares. Will never ever fly United again. I could spend 3 hours writing what happened on each flight. This is about our April 2015 trip to Maui. We pulled away from the gate at LAX (Los Angeles and headed down the runway.) The pilot then pulled the plane off the runway. He came on the loud speaker and said he thought the plane was too heavy.  We were seconds from takeoff. Pilot said it would take 20 minutes for United to calculate the weight of the cargo and passengers. The plane sat there was no air conditioning and it was 90F on board. Every 30 minutes the pilot came on the loudspeaker and said United was still calculating the weight. Our plane was huge and there was 2 toilets on the entire plane. 14 or more people in line for the 2 toilets the entire time on the runway and in the air. The passengers demanded that the plane return to the terminal due to the heat on the plane and lack of food. We were on the runway now 1 hour 45 minutes. Passengers told the crew that we were going to call CNN and report this.  Surprisingly the pilot did. 2 passengers got kicked off and I think one small box in cargo was taken off. We left LAX 2 hours late. No food on board. Total flight time to Maui was 8 hours instead of 5 hours and no food, but they sold box of crackers for $11. ";NEGATIVE

Unfortunately I had to be home by noon. They didn't offer a hotel either. I rented a car to drive home that late night/ morning. I was told to submit my receipt for reimbursement. United decided not to reimburse the rental but sent me a travel certificate. Just a way to make me purchase another ticket from them. In the end, they didn't give a damn. They screwed up, I paid the price. They will continue to screw up until there's a real impact to their bottom line. Therefore, I'll do my part and not use them again.";NEGATIVE

This time I opted to upgrade to Business Class on all three routes. Checking in was a breeze in EWR and security was surprisingly easy this time. Minor note, there is absolutely no reason to ever go to the Presidents club anymore in EWR with the updated food options in Terminal C. I would rather pay for a decent breakfast/lunch/dinner then eat the garbage they offer in the Club for ""free"". The seats were nice, however they allow too much recline for seats given the limited seat pitch. The gentleman in front of me reclined all the way back and I struggled to exit my seat to use the facilities without being very disruptive. Apart from the minor issue with the seats everything else about the flight was more than acceptable. The food was good not great. We were offered a decent breakfast, however the coffee is dreadful and the tea no better. The flight attendants were attentive and very cordial the entire time. Flying back thru to EWR from PVR via IAH was just fine except for the disaster that is IAH security. We nearly missed our connection due to extremely long queues to pass back through security after clearing customs. I have never seen only one line open in IAH when you have multiple flights trying to get through security at the same time. There were multiple people in line with us that missed their connections.";POSITIVE

It was a code share flight operated by United. I wanted to switch to a morning flight and had been told to speak to the ground crew to do that. The United staff would not let me change the flight, saying it was their ticket, and added that the code sharing was just a marketing trick, and ""why would we do anything like"" changing your ticket. Fortunately, the Air Canada ground crew was more reasonable, and booked me on the (half-empty) morning flight on Air Canada. More than their incompetence (obviously it could be done since the AC rep did it for me), the United reps' rudeness was bizarre. I cancelled my United credit card today. The first leg of my trip was on United. That was the last time I fly on that airline.";NEGATIVE

We flew on 4 flights during which there were 3 medical emergencies. My daughter is a nurse and attended to passengers on each occasion.

Return flight to Melbourne flight was overbooked, we could not sit together. I would never fly this airline again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-13;"San Francisco to Orlando. We were surprised how good United Airlines were after reading the reviews. Plane was clean and comfortable and after getting off an 11 hour Air New Zealand long haul flight we were expecting very small cramped seats - but there was not actually a lot of difference between United and Air NZ. What was appreciated was when the cabin crew asked if I would like the three seats behind me and allowed me to move prior to take off. So 6 seats between 3 made it even more comfy. We didn't expect IFE or food so no problems there. Plane departed on time and arrived early. Cabin crew and ground staff all pretty good. I'm taking off a point for no snacks and no IFE but I'm giving a bonus point for friendly cabin crew and generous drink serves. We have long haul flights on United in March which we were dreading, but now not so much.";POSITIVE

We didn't make our event which was planned 6 months in advance.  We flew United Airlines from John Wayne Airport, no problem. On our second leg of the trip from Newark to Pearson, we didn't exist in United Airlines flight plan nor Orbitz. United Airlines blamed Orbitz, Orbitz blamed United Airlines. United Airlines say they will happily re-book and the only available flight was the next evening. Didn't offer hotel or food voucher for me and my kids - they say it's not their fault. On our flight back to John Wayne, United Airlines again didn't have me and my kids on their flight plan. They put me and my kids in place of some other poor folks who will probably write some bad reviews also. I will never used United Airlines again and will discourage anyone from using them.

Running through the airport I injured my knee but kept on going to make my flight. Got to the gate the plane was there but would not let me on. Told me I would be able to get out the next day at 8:50 am. Asked for a supervisor and when he got there was extremely rude. I told him I would not stay the night and find me another flight. He did on American Airlines. Got into Orlando 2 hrs late. Flight home was just as bad. Get into Newark for connecting flight and was told I would be taking a bus by ground to Allentown. Almost a 2 hr bus ride cramped in a small bus once again not acceptable. I contacted United and have not heard back from them.  Will never fly United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE

Food mediocre at best, slightly better out of Dubai. Lie Flat seats decent except the 2-4-2 seat layout is an abomination. Glad I didn't get stuck in middle for USD7K ticket. Not sure who came up with that layout but should probably be fired. Entertainment system was the only redeeming factor on this flight with excellent choice.

I feel that the customers should be made aware of that you have need to pay for luggage. This is the last time I fly with United Airlines.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-09;"Minneapolis to Brussels via Chicago. United Airlines Premium economy class makes international flights easier and more comfortable especially on less crowded flights. The premium seats are usually emptier and provide an inexpensive way to survive long haul flights. Great recline and roomier space make for a comfortable journey. I've been traveling with United for years and have begun branching out with other carriers with an eye on improved differences. On United flights, I've frequently had access to power outlets and love the TV monitors at each seat with an above average choice selection of movies. In the last year they've changed their economy class breakfast snack upon arrival to European airports and not for the better. We used to get a warm croissant, juice and fruit. Now you get just a cold croissant with choice of orange juice, coffee or tea. Wish they would stop downgrading services, complaining about the competitors and up their standard sand do more to keep the customers they already have.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-09;"I have flown United Airlines many times and  the service was so-so. But this San Francisco to Vancouver flight was exceptional. Check-in was quick and easy as well as boarding. By luck we had priority boarding which meant we had space in the bins. This was a full flight so this was a releif. The service was friendly. It was a bummer that you had to pay to watch movies and wifi. Overall, a great flight but, it's United Airlines. So don't exspect crazy good service on all United flights. It really depends who is serving onboard.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-08;"Melbourne to Los Angeles to Chicago, returning from Boston. We thought the extra money for Premium Economy worth it for the International leg. Not only is there extra legroom but there were many spare seats. So a bit of moving around enabled plenty of cabin space for these long flights. Domestic flights are an entirely different matter. On all our legs United Airlines oversold tickets to ensure every seat was taken. Their loading policy is bizaar. We were always last on (group 5) because we had asked for aisle seats. On any other airline this would probably not matter but because United does not enforce its own carry on luggage rules, the last 50 or so passengers on all the internal legs we flew, had to at the last minute submit to having their carry on luggage removed and sent under plane. This is maybe not a big deal on a short 5 hour flight but our carry on was taken off us as we came down the loading trunk and booked through to Melbourne, two whole days away. Scrabbling to get out medications etc in the unheated trunk in the freezing air of Boston Airport is no fun. (I'm 67) so difficult to get down to get stuff out let alone remember all the things you may need on such a long journey. So shame on United, I'd paid as much as anyone in Economy and some had carry on whilst arbitrarily others did not and for such a long journey. They treat customers with absolute contempt and do not deliver what you have paid for.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-07;"Washington to Phoenix. Embarrassing is the first word that comes to my mind for United Airlines. For a flight of 5 hours, a Boeing 737 with narrow pitch in economy. Food is with a charge (at the beginning I thought it was a joke), not even peanuts (for a 5 hour flight). No video or audio systems or screens with flight routes/flight information. Boarding with ""groups"" system, but non effective and useless, as if you use groups, you should board the bottom passengers first to avoid ""traffic jams"", if you do random groups, it just a waste of time. In Europe we have a low-cost airline called Ryanair, which is considered mostly like a bus carrier, but compared to United Airlines it is like Swiss. And this should be a Star Alliance company? Never again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-11-07;"Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for. My experience is that E+ is not worth the extra money even on a 14 hour flight. Another satisfactory experience with United Airlines.";POSITIVE

Before departure first class flight attendants eating while boarding process. No service until almost 60 minutes into flight. The meal served, Dim-Sum was the worst I have ever had, dry and tasteless. Flying United is always a gamble and the service by the cabin crew was extremely poor and not attentive.";NEGATIVE

They say on the website to call to request certain things. I called. I stated my request. They said please hold - then they put me on hold for 37 minutes. When another person picked up there was no apology or explanation and I was told there was a form I had to fill out and send in for disability related issues.

The co-pilot was late for 2 of the flights which caused us to be late for our connecting flight. Almost missed my plane home - I made it, but sadly my baggage did not. As I was waiting for my bag to arrive last night at the baggage claim, I finally grab it only to notice that the carry strap at the top is missing. It had hooks on it to secure it to the bag and it has endured flights before, just not this one! Someone must have needed the strap more than me. As I picked up the bag and headed for the claims office, I find the bag is covered in grease which now has gotten on me...The claims woman's response to my question of ""what are you going to do about this?"" was answered with ""I don't know"". They said I could bring the bag back up, a 50 mile one way trip for me, to have them send it out for cleaning. All I can say is don't fly with this airline - if you can avoid them, do it.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-11-02;"I used to love Continental, the service was consistently above average and the flight experience was satisfactory, if not enjoyable. Since the merger with United I feel the benefits have been reduced, the services have been cut or monetized. This has created a tough environment for your employees to maintain good service. That being said, I was very impressed by the agent at the gate during boarding. Our flight was overbooked and my 8 year old son and I were seated in different rows. With no incentives to give to other passengers she found a way to get us seated together. Once aboard I was surprised to find that the flight did not include any type of in-flight entertainment, no screens and no audio. I gladly purchased it on the 5+ hr flight from EWR to PHX, but this was not even an option on the return. I was also surprised that there was NO safety demonstration given on the flight, which is definitely unsafe and possibly in violation of FAA rules. Lastly, the variety and quality of food available for purchase was poor. After flying over 250,000 miles with Continental/United, when possible I now actively avoid and will pay higher fares to select other airlines that offer better service.";NEGATIVE

I had plenty of time clearing both customs and enjoying the AC Maple Leaf lounge at Pearson but the United personnel at check-in failed to explain that after checking in on my UA flight I had to check the bags myself prior clearing US customs - so my bag remained in the departure area for some 4 hours without having anyone page me! 40 minutes before departure the person at the gate called my name and asked me to go back to departure to check my bag. It's useless to mention that I rushed downstairs, found my bag, missed my plane and had to clear both customs again with thousands of people waiting in line. There is something wrong with United Airlines! Why don't they tell passengers that they have to check their own bags prior clearing customs? I had a business class ticket and of course the 7:15pm flight only had economy - at least I made it to Chicago that same day but not one word of apology for misleading me or even, check my bag so that I won't miss my flight. I will not fly United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

The two FAs were efficient and courteous. It was a long walk between gates at Denver (B79 to B17) for the connecting flight so glad I allowed more than the legal connection time when booking. The Houston plane was full and there was the usual problem of pax bringing on too many/oversized carry ons but the crew handled the situation well. Cabin service during the flight was adequate with trainees helping out. Only minor complaint was that the volume of the announcements from the cockpit was too low to be useful. Obviously our bags made an earlier flight as they were waiting for us in Houston. United informed us about this situation via email as well as an announcement at baggage claim.

I thought it was a rather unusual question given that I was traveling on an Australian passport. And when I attempted to explain that I don't need a visa to go home, she continued to argue that I need to present one. And it all went downhill from there. When I finally boarded the plane and I was offered a drink, I politely asked if I could have a glass of water without ice. I was thirsty as I just raced through LAX to make my connecting flight home. And I could not believe my ears when the crew member responded with the question 'What's wrong with you?' Now I know why United has such a poor reputation.

united-airlines;2015-10-29;"I found myself on a United flight bak to London by accident recently after British Airways had to change aircraft from an A380 to a B747 which meant they had to re-book quite a few passengers onto alternative flights. I must say when I heard I was going back on United I was pretty disappointed as I've always thought of them to have a pretty mediocre reputation. However, I think that mainly applies to their domestic US operations. Perhaps because my expectations were low, I was pleasantly surprised. I think I ended up in United's Premium Economy, Economy Plus. The main selling point here being the extra leg room, which I have to say was pretty ample for economy class. The staff both on the ground and in the air were excellent, very friendly and professional. The inflight entertainment was so-so, but comparable in many ways to that of British Airways on my flight out. There was very little choice in the way of films and TV shows.Many of the TV shows only seemed to have one or two random episodes available to watch.The screen was pretty small though and it was really tricky to select the required item on the touch screen. The cursor kept on hovering over the wrong item. Although annoying, on a 7hr flight it did the job. The food was pretty mediocre I have to say - like a deeply budget ready meal. I know airline food is never going to be that great, but compared to other long haul flights i've taken recently with the likes of Cathay Pacific and even BA, it was pretty bad. Also, the wine on offer was from a juice carton which was ominous - it tasted like it was from a juice carton too. Not sure they'd be my first choice in the future, but not as bad as I was expecting. For the 7hr journey across the atlantic it did the job.";NEGATIVE

The only part of the ""United experience"" that I am not a fan of is the boarding area of Terminal 7 at LAX.

Seat back in-flight entertainment was extensive. This was my fifth long-distance international flight with United this year, and I haven't had a single delay or problem on any of them. I think some people have unrealistic or outdated expectations of what air travel is like these days. United fulfilled all my expectations.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-27;"Flight from BQN to EWR was nothing out of the ordinary but it was comfortable and uneventful, even if it was a red-eye I would've liked some sort of refreshment or meal offered for free for a 4 hour flight. Or at least entertainment options. Flight from EWR to PVG a pleasure, flight on time, ground staff welcoming and helpful. Cabin crew was always willing to serve. Free beer that made the trip easier, also United has a 3 course meal for international long haul flights. IFE had a big selection (and the complete 007 film library as something special for October).";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-26;Worst airplane for long United Airlines flight and Horribly cramped. The plane is designed to cram in as many passengers as possible regardless of comfort and convenience. There are only 2 lavatories and the doors swing into the aisle. Absolutely stupid design. People are backed up in the aisles and the crew is impeded from serving. The crew detests this aircraft too as they can't do their jobs. Also there is very little leg room. My husbands knees were hitting the seat in front. There is no pouch to put your book or newspaper in. All end up on your lap or the floor. I will avoid this type of plane in the future.;NEGATIVE

My return flight (September 21st) was one of the best flights I have had in many years. From the moment I stepped on the plane I was greeted by friendly staff who were joking with the passengers and eager to help those with their luggage. Even one of the pilots stood by the entrance for a few minutes to welcome boarders. Service was terrific and we were updated regularly on our schedule, route and time-lines. When de-planning once again the staff were helpful and friendly.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-25;"I booked a United Airlines flight for me and my boyfriend in April 2015 for a trip to Taiwan in October 2015. We chose United in order to connect in San Francisco with my brother. I had more issues with this flight than I have ever had in my life of flying internationally. A month before our trip, our connecting flight from SFO to LAX was cancelled, and we were rebooked for a layover that was twice as long (3 hrs).  8 hours before our flight to SFO, we received an email at 1AM that our flight had been cancelled. Upon calling customer service and asking why it was such a short notice and why we weren't called, only emailed, I was yelled at because ""we were notified, weren't we?"" Luckily I woke up in the middle of the night so we managed to rebook a flight for an hour earlier. An hour before our rebooked flight, it is announced that the flight has been delayed for 5 hours, so we miss our connecting flight with my brother, and we end up waiting at the airport for 5 hours and connecting in Tokyo instead of SFO. On the flight, my inflight entertainment console broke and was stuck on ""Disney movies"" before we even took off. For our trip home, our seats were changed from an aisle and a middle seat to two middle seats without notice. I have never been so frustrated flying with an airline and am extremely upset that we booked so far in advance in order to fly with my brother and land at the same time, and we could not make that happen. 0/10, never flying United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-25;"I was never so angry and heated in my life. First of all United Airlines had me sit there from 11 am and kept delaying even though the weather was fine in both locations. Then they told us that they were waiting for the crew - then leaving - and then by 4 they just canceled my flight home. I had to wait in line for 2 hours even though I was the 5th person in line, because 3 ladies were helping only one person at the time and the 3 ladies were rude to customers. I was put on standby but luckily found another flight to get home. When on that flight the flight attendant told me that there was another flight to Buffalo canceled due to the same reason of not having enough staff. Really United? How do you not figure this out in advanced! Very disappointed, better off spending the money and going on a different aircraft.";NEGATIVE

It was our first time with United Airlines. Every flight was on time, connections easy due to the helpfulness of ground staff. During the flights the attendants were helpful and friendly. The food was so-so but we don't expect gourmet on planes. Due to the duration of some flights we had upgraded to Economy Plus seats, a must for longer journeys, and we had gone online to select our seats as soon as we received booking confirmation - go for the exit seats within your booking class of seat for 2-3 times the leg room of others in the same class. I have seen complaints from somebody who turned up at check-in and expected to get four seats together for his family and complained when they weren't available. Do it online to avoid problems. I sympathize with people who have had bad experiences, most of which are totally unacceptable, but felt that we saw a different side to report and show it is not all negative. We have no ties to, or preference for, United Airlines or any other airline, and hope our 'luck' continues regardless of who we fly with. To those who have suffered, may your future journeys be as trouble free as ours was.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-24;"Having only flown United Airlines a few times on this route I never really took notice of the service provided.

Check in staff were efficient, planes were comfortable and clean, the food was airline food so I would suggest bring your own food. Cabin crew were efficient - not very friendly but they got the work done. All flights were full and they offered to take cabin bags free of charge in the hold, despite Cabin Crew telling passengers to stow large bags overhead and small bags under seats - people just do not listen. I would fly with United again.";POSITIVE

The dinner was surprisingly excellent (thai chicken) and service was superb. Hopped to Reno on Southwest which is the only direct carrier from LAS and is fine for a short haul. Returned RNO-DEN-LAS again on United and was again amazed at service on both flights. Dinner flight (Buffalo Chicken Sandwich) from DEN not as good as out of IAH but better than average and better than I remember Air Canada dishing out domestically. ;POSITIVE

We weren't even going across country, staying on the same coast. They took 35k miles + $86 for just one ticket. And the only options in seats you get are all the way in the back, unless you want to pay extra to ""upgrade"" on an old uncomfortable aircraft. And don't forget I pay a $95 annual fee! What's the point of being a club member again? United Airlines program is less than satisfactory. It's misleading and I feel like I got scammed. The worst program I've ever used.

Had to tell her while booking the flight it said the flight was overbooked. By the time I run to the connecting flight I will have no seats. Finally I convince her to switch it. I had initially booked a window seat. Told her specifically to book the window seat again. She agrees, and I get the email only to see its the middle seat. I asked again is this the window seat and she said yes. Went online to double check it, she did give me the middle seat. Then tells me there are no seat available! This is not the first time.

I was waitlisted for the business upgrade but at the time of check in, I was told that I was not even on the list. No one could explain as to how my name disappeared from the list. This has happened to me the third time. Very frustrating, especially when you book in advance to be on top of the wait list. At the time of check in again I was manually included in the list which put me as the last one on the list. Crazy. I am very disappointed with United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-16;"Absolutely horrible service. My original booking was changed by United Airlines after I had paid - they changed the times. I called to see if I could get on an earlier flight, as I needed to be there before a certain time window. The woman on the phone was pleasant and polite but she kept putting me on hold and the whole process took over 1.5 hours. After confirming flight numbers and times, she sent me an email confirmation. I reviewed it after we had hung up and she scheduled the wrong day. I immediately called back and now they can't fix it back to the original or to the correct day without charging me. Are you kidding me. I do not recommend United Airlines at all.";NEGATIVE

She vas very nice and all the staff were friendly, we got free snacks and a bottle of wine.  We had a great start of our honeymoon thanks to them!";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-14;"I applaud United Airlines for attempting to only allow passengers with 2 pieces of carry-ons. However the customer service in regards to only allowing 2 pieces of carry-ons needs to be improved. Flight out of Seattle to Cincinnati via Houston had rude customer service at the boarding gate. If everyone is allowed 2 pieces of luggage to carry on, then the service on the plane also needs to follow and hold the passengers accountable, ie. one piece of luggage on top while the second piece must go underneath the seat. Just because I do not pay the extra to fly first class, does not mean my luggage is less important. I'm a frequent flyer with United (140k in miles), or at least I was until this past weekend, so you would think that making sure each and every customer would be valued by United. Flying back from Cincinnati to Seattle, via D.C. was just atrocious. Arrived in Cincinnati, only to find my flight was delayed 30 mins due to a late inbound flight - but why did it take United 20 mins before I was to board my plane to email me that information? Then another 20 mins later, received an email that the flight was delayed another 30 mins and the gate changed (luckily just the gate over). My connecting flight out of D.C. to Seattle would surely be missed as I would still be in the air while my flight to my final destination would be taking off. Many of us were in similar predicaments. We were speaking with the woman at the boarding gate, and she advised us our flight was out of the original gate (A11). Then when we all showed her our email from United stating our gate was out of A13, so needed to radio down to ask. One person came back on the radio that the flight to D.C. was out of A11, while another person responded with out of A13. When the gate was determined, the woman at the boarding gate now needed to find if the flight to D.C. was first or if the flight to Houston was next as boarding was soon going to happen. Needless to say, my flight was messed up and I ended up staying in Cincinnati for another night. The next day (Oct. 12), I attempted to fly out of Cincinnati to Seattle via Houston. As soon as I arrived at the airport, I yet again received an email from United that my flight was delayed. Surely this wasn't all going to happen again. I was flying out of the same gate, so perhaps? With that flight being late, we were not sure if I would make the connecting flight to Seattle out of Houston. My flight from Cincinnati to Houston was a little over 2 hours and all passengers were able to get a full can of soda. Luckily, passengers were nice and allowed people at the back of the plane to get off in order to maybe make their connection. Rushed to make the connection and the women at the gate were extremely rude. We told one that others were coming from the late flight out of Cincinnati and her response was ""We cannot hold the gate for anyone. You can stay and wait and see if the rest of you party makes it though, but we cannot hold the gate for anyone."". The second woman (taking the boarding tickets) was just as rude. Again the whole you can only have 2 pieces of luggage is fine, but when you are following the rules, having to check your bag at the gate is absurd when United does not actually enforce the ""the second bag must go under the seat."". Something needs to be changed on United's end to continue having paying, satisfied customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-14;"After years of collecting credit card points we decided to use them to fly first class from Toronto to Hawaii and back. We had to go with what was provided. The first flight from Toronto to Los Angeles was in first class on Air Canada. We had a ""pod"" type seat which reclined flat. We were provided with comfortable pillows and a comforter. We had our own individual screen and could watch movies, tv, etc. The food was great and service equally as good. It was everything we had imagined first class would be. We had the same first class treatment from Los Angeles back to Toronto. The polar opposite is true of our United Airlines portion from Los Angeles to Hawaii. The plane is old and first class only means wider seats that recline slightly more than economy with more leg room but extremely uncomfortable to try and sleep in. Besides the food, the only extra we got was a paper thin blanket - no pillows, no screens, no music, nothing. You have to download the app if you want to watch something or listen to music. What if you don't have a smart phone or don't want to watch a movie on it? The flight to Hawaii was bad enough but unfortunately we were stuck with United Airlines on the overnight flight from Hawaii back to Los Angeles and hardly slept a wink. Ironically before we left home, I decided to leave my neck pillow at home. Why bring it - we were flying first class. Big mistake. United's definition of ""first class"" is no class. I regret wasting the points I took so long to collect on the United Airlines flights. I will never knowingly fly United again. Giving this a 2 only because the flight attendants were friendly and I felt sorry for them having to work for this airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-14;Twice in the last six months I have purchased United Airlines first class tickets only to arrive at the airport and find out we were in coach for the return trip. The first time we paid $600 in baggage fees because we had packed all of our bags to 70 pounds instead of 50. We were given the option of flying another day first class and not having to pay the baggage fees but there was no compromise on the baggage the day planned to fly. The same thing happened again today and I was forced to change my flight to fly first class in again not pay overage fees on my baggage. This really looks like a scam to me.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-13;"Sydney to Sioux Falls via San Francisco and Denver, excellent flights. Check in in SYD was a breeze with a very helpful ground staff. Seats in Y were comfortable enough aided by the fact the plane was only about a third full so everyone had a chance to spread out. The international leg had attentive crews with plenty of water runs. Food (lunch and breakfast) was more than passable. We were aware they had stopped supplying a mid flight snack so had taken our own. IFE was good with plenty of movies and TV shows. The Denver flight was 100% full and as usual the vast majority of pax had ignored the carry on rules. The FAs did their best to accommodate everyone and I don't think any gate checking was necessary. United really need to bite the bullet and enforce their carryon rules either at the gate or in the airbridge to make their domestic flights a little more comfortable. The crew did a good job supplying drinks and BoB snacks after take off despite a rather turbulent trip. The short last leg went without a hitch and arrived at our destination early. All in all no complaints. Have been flying this route with UA for a decade on a regular basis and have never had any real problems.";POSITIVE

The ladies at both counters were brutal, the customer service was awful. Long lines and understaffed! Angry woman with absolutely no coordination between either airline. In the end they earlier flight ended up with more seats available and was delayed itself 30 mins - but do you think they wanted to be helpful and get us easy passengers with carry on bags on that flight? Nope. I fly Southwest Airlines for a reason. I would not recommend United Airlines to anyone. I paid lots of money for a non-stop, good timing flight and now this! ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-11;"We sat on the LAX terminal for about 30 plus extra minutes waiting to take off without A/C. The two flight attendants seemed like they had no clue what to say or do before the flight even took off.  We left at 7:30ish from LAX and planned to land in San Antonio around midnight, about 11pm we get notified we're making an emergency landing in El Paso to re-fuel due to a storm and we need to go around it. As soon as we start landing, the lights start flickering on and off. So we land, they can't leave the A/C on because they have to shut everything off to re-fuel. We sat on there for an hour or more while they re-fueled, and then not only to tell us we may or may not be going through the storm but the lights were flicking because the LAX crew didn't charge the battery enough and that sucked all the energy so they're needing to trouble shoot that, but we'll be fine and off in a jiffy. One guy yelled ""what's going on?"" and the lady flight attendant literally ""shhhh""ed him! They kept going into the cockpit with the pilots and coming out with looks on their faces like ""we're screwed"", but they didn't have the decency to tell us anything. When a man asked about what's going on, the male flight attendant said ""well we had to re-fuel to go around the storm, if we go through it, it'll rip these wings right off. I don't think any of us want that do we."" While we are still sitting on there for who knows how long, the man comes back on and says ""Hey guys we know it's hot but it's just one thing after another, apparently one of the engines isn't working so we're bringing mechanics out to fix it, but it'll be fine."" So, they finally get sense to let us off the plane, we take our carry-ons and walk off the plane onto the terminal, walk up another set of stairs into the tunnel and sit in the airport, it's about 12:30am at this point. We sit for about an hour without any word from anyone and then a guy from the airport says we're going downstairs to get vouchers ""just in case"" we can't fly tonight. Clearly, no one wants to get on this plane. We stand around waiting for someone to give us vouchers for about 30 mins. They put our luggage in baggage claim so we can go get it. Then they say we'll have a flight at 7am because all others are full and it's on the same plane.  We could either stay on cots at the airport or get hotel vouchers, but per the airport all the hotels were full. So the next morning everyone is ready to go at 6:30am, we've had a good few hours of a nap. 7am rolls around and no plane. The lady from the night before that was telling us of information of flight ""choices"" and so forth comes and says once again ""I work for the airport not the airline, I didn't promise you a flight at 7am."" When last night, she literally was the one that informed us of everything. So we wait for about an hour plus before a plane that had no one on it magically appears for us to go on. This whole time the airport staff and security was arguing and yelling back and forth at the passengers who were expressing their frustrations. We ended up in SAT 2 hours later than promised but made it home.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-11;"The carry on baggage policy is laughable. A bin less than 2/3 of the size of the actual overhead luggage space is used to determine whether it is the right size. And the gate agents decide who they are going to challenge to go through the process of placing your carry ons in their bin. I have never had a problem getting my carry on to fit in the overhead. Traveling with a family of 4, all with properly sized carry ons, the gate agents singled us out and forced us to gate check the bags.

Finally reached Miami delayed by some hours. Miraculously we took off on time on October 10th from Miami to Houston. However true to their modus operandi we are here in Houston delayed cause our aircraft is stuck in Wichita. Lord alone knows when we will reach home. United Airlines is operating like a 3rd rate dysfunctional airline during the off season. I shudder to think of it's performance during the holidays.

They never offered blankets or pillows, we were on our own. We were here for about 12 hours with everything shut down, nothing eat or drink until morning for most - unless it was from a vending machine or to go from terminal A over to terminal A which is on the other side of the airport.

I had no issues with service as the attendants were friendly and efficient. I had a 15 hour flight from LA to melbourne on a new Boeing 787, which was very clean, seats were comfortable, food was ok, portions were a little small however. Toilets were clean, attendants were friendly and offered water throughout and were quite chatty with customers. My suitcase arrived in one piece.

He was stranded for over another 2 hours looking for his wheelchair. Fortunately, I made enough noise that his return flight was incident free. Warning, if you are disabled and fly United Airlines make lots of noise to ensure you received the attention you need from staff that work for United.

Offered a pre-departure drink and had my coat hung. Menus handed out and newspapers offered. There were four entree choices including short ribs, Amazon cod, pasta and chicken. I chose the cod which was delicious and perfectly prepared. Dinner preceded by drinks with warm nuts, an appetizer (smoked salmon), and a salad with a choice of dressings each served as a separate course. Dinner was then followed by a cheese chart first with port then ice cream sundaes. The service was very good. My champagne glass was filled 3 times without even looking up and the label was shown to me. Being in the middle, I had 2 different flight attendants fawning all over me. I slept well as it was a flat bed seat. We were asked if we wanted to be woken up for breakfast. I said yes so about an hour before landing the lights came on and breakfast was served.

The staff was very rude and point blank told us ""What do you gonna do about it?"" There was no attempt made to rectify the situation or pacify customers. Customer service manager on the flight told us that she will reboot the system to try fix the problem, but she did not do anything as my screen was frozen in front of me all the time and showed no signs of system being rebooted. On further enquiring one of the flight attendant revealed that the plane (Boeing 787) had the same problem coming in and since fixing it would mean delaying the flight, they chose not to fix it, or inform us. In fact, when we boarded we could see the entertainment menu but nothing was playing and the staff told us that it will work once we are in air. The flight attendants were seen only when the food service was taking place. They did not bother to do rounds to find out if somebody needed anything as the attendant call button was not working. They just turned off the the cabin lights and disappeared. Just imagine 12 hour flight without entertainment system, reading light, no wifi and broken call button.

First off our flight out of PDX was delayed 6+ hours causing us to miss our connecting flight in Denver. We were then rerouted to Seattle where we had 2 reservations to make another connecting flight. Once arriving in Seattle we were informed that we were actually waitlisted and did not have seats on their flight. After not being able to get on this flight we went back to the service counter to then again be rerouted. There were no flights until the following day for our destination. We requested they send us back to PDX and refund us our trip. After hours of phone calls and talking with the customer service desk they agreed to send us back to PDX. Worst part about this entire ordeal? They won't refund our $1,000 trip that was never had! I have spent the last 2 weeks on trying to get refunded and they only refunded us $150. I can say United's poor customer service and unwillingness for credit or refund has turned me off from never wanting to fly with again. I am very disappointed.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-07;"The United Airlines app is a joke, and they make it impossible for you to check in and receive your boarding passes without uploading your passports to the App.  My first time flying international with them this year was in July 2015. We were with a group of 7 people and my poor mom was trying to organize the entire thing by herself. She downloaded the app, and got all of our passports - but it kept saying that it wasn't responding and would shut down. I downloaded it as well, and it did the same thing every single time I tried to upload a passport. She has an iphone, I have a samsung galaxy. This is happening again for my trip tomorrow. I have called United 3 times today and they don't have any way to help me. The App is the only way to check in with your passports if you are flying internationally. This is ridiculous. For a company that is as large as United Airlines, you would think they would want this problem fixed. If this doesn't get resolved, I don't think I will ever fly United ever again. I'm extremely frustrated, and the customer service was no help at all.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-07;"Seattle to Las Vegas via San Francisco with United Airlines. Before heading to the airport I received notice that our flight was a couple hours delayed so they offered to switch our flight. We got new flight info to leave an hour or so after our original flight, and got to the airport to hear our new flight was delayed. We were concerned about missing our connection so we called into customer service, they looked up our info and told us it would be no problem we had plenty of time. Landed in San Francisco for our connection realized how close we were going to be, so we called in again to let them know we were on the plane waiting to get off - so they called the desk to inform them we were coming. They told us they would not hold our connecting flight that we were going to just miss it. At the same time the pilot came on to the intercom to let the other passengers know the connecting flight to Hawaii was being held so they would make it. So you hold some flights but not others. We got off the plane and went to customer service to get a different flight and experienced two of the rudest customer service agents I have encountered - showed zero empathy and were told they wouldn't do anything for us, it was not their fault flights get delayed and that is something that has to be handled through the phone. What is the point of even having customer service at the airport if all they do is tell you to call someone else. So we called in and were told all they could do was submit a form and someone would email me - it has been five days still no email. The agent on the phone informed me that she would give us a seat with more leg room, but the only people that could do it was the customer service at the airport that had already told me they had no ability to help - so went back to the counter and the lady and her manager I spoke to earlier walked away from counter, so they didn't have to speak with me. I explained what happened again and the customer service already told me they had the ability to do it and I was still on the phone if they wanted to talk to them about it. After a deep sigh they moved us up a couple rows so we had more leg room - seriously we had to go through all that for more leg room. If I could give negative stars I would, and suggest people book with someone who will value their time and care if they continue as a customer.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-06;"I will avoid United Airlines in the future. Two long delays on two segments of a two segment trip. Also, United has poor legroom in economy (I've actually had more comfortable seats in Southwest). Everything is an ""upgrade"" even when there are open seats on the plane. United also discourages checked baggage with $25 fee for first bag and a whopping $40 for second. As a result overhead bins are almost always full requiring you to check carry on at the gate. Because of all the carry on bags, boarding and deplaning is very slow. Airlines pay for time at the gate. The faster they can get people on and off the plane the less it costs them. Every airline should offer 2 free checked bags and allow only one personal item carry on. This would speed up the process greatly.";NEGATIVE

Every time I fly it's with the same roller board and the same boot bag for my tall boots (I train horses). Both items are always carried on no problem, the one goes over head and the boots under the seat - except tonight. I was stopped before going through security and told my roller bag was too big. I went to their kiosk across from security where it tuned out the Mobile boarding pass scanner wasn't working so he entered my info twice manually before deciding his system didn't work and I had to go to the desk. Annoyed I went around the corner and moved the jacket into my boot bag so the suitcase would fit in their bin. I went back to security where they didn't even ask to check the size of my bag but then told me my boot bag was too big. Keep in my my friend had gone through security with the same boot bag with her helmet attached to it not 5 minutes before and had not been stopped. Both the manager from United Airlines was incredibly rude as was the security staff. The manager threatened to not let me on the flight - all this over bags that easily fit on the flight and that had both been carried on all of my other United flights including the one to CA 3 days earlier. United is a highly short sighted company with a very poor customer service vision and corporate culture. They don't realize that by ruining a clients experience before they even get on the flight they breed a culture of rudeness. I am normally a model passenger - kind to other passengers, nice to the flight attendants, complimentary to the pilots - after this I have no reason to look at a United Airlines  staff member in the eye, clear my trays from the security line, or engage in any kind of pleasantries. I'll for sure be looking to avoid United travel in the future.";NEGATIVE

So on the day of travel, they did give me seats, but me and my wife had to sit 20 rows apart. The staff obviously hate their job or passengers or both.

Simultaneously ORD was suffering weather delays. The flight left MKE at 8:41, more than an hour late which resulted in missed flights. United Airlines at ORD refused lodging vouchers because the incident was registered as ATC (air traffic control). It is the belief of passengers on the plane that MKE falsified information.

united-airlines;2015-10-02;"As a Star Alliance Gold member, United Airlines has been my first choice when flying from the States. However my last flight with them from San Francisco to London was rather disappointing. On check-in, the rather rude agent tried to downgrade my paid business ticket to economy due to an apparent overbooking. Only after I called her supervisor did she keep my ticket in business. As there was only 20 minutes till boarding, I had to run to the gate, only just getting on my flight even with TSA priority pass. The flight was operated by an antiquated Boeing 777, it had the old business class layout. The old layout for me is one of the worst due to it's extremely narrow 8 abreast business seating. That's the same as Cathay's premium economy! We departed on time and the flight was smooth. Then, 5 hours into the flight, the entertainment system for the first and business class cabins went kaput. When passengers started pressing the crew call buttons, the Flight Attendants seemed unapologetic and were even borderline rude. One even said ""It's not my fault so stop calling!"" Fortunately, we only had 3 hours left on the flight so, I decided to just get some sleep. We arrived in LHR on time, although that is pretty much the only positive thing I can say about on this flight. I probably will continue to fly United, although they really need to improve their service.";NEGATIVE

The economy seat was comfortable, service good and great food options were well presented. The onboard Internet worked really well.

Got the third degree while waiting in line for bag drop (where are you staying, why are you visiting America) as well as the usual check-in questions I had already answered at the machine. Much the same quizzing at the boarding gate. As we entered the aircraft the staff did not bother to check our boarding passes, give directions to our seat, or even smile. Legroom was pretty poor and the seat back in front of me was frayed. The entertainment was okay, some good movies. Screens a little unresponsive. Food tasted good. I asked for coffee and was given water at one point. Once again on exiting the plane no one bothered to say goodbye. I don't think I've ever had such indifferent service on a flight before. I felt like an inconvenience, not a customer. Communications from the captain good, and other than the usual Heathrow 15 minute delay the flight was on time. United Airlines got the job done, but not particularly comfortably or with good service.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-10-01;"London to Charleston via Newark, and Myrtle Beach to Toronto via Newark. The most positive things I can say about my United Airlines experience were that I made my connections and my bags arrived in the right place on time. There it stops. Why are United using antique 767s on the London - Newark route? They are uncomfortable, the noisiest aircraft I have ever travelled on, the food was basically inedible. As for IFE, I think I would have been less offended if there was none. Minute screen, and only a choice of 5 or so films, which played on a loop so if you missed the start or - heaven forbid - wanted to go to the bathroom, then tough luck, you've missed part of the film. Cabin staff were friendly. On arrival at Newark, I was pleasantly surprised to make my connection between terminals in under two hours. However, like their planes, the circle of hell that is the United gates at Terminal A desperately needs dragging into the 21st century. EWR-CHS leg was on a tiny ERJ145 which was thrown around in a thunderstorm. The stewardess was the finest I have ever encountered though. full marks to her good humour. On the return, MYR-EWR was delayed an hour with no explanation, info or apology from ground staff. Flight was OK but service poor. Transfer in EWR was far better this time. Terminal C is surprisingly nice for a US airport. Crew on EWR-YYZ leg clearly could not be bothered to do any work as they left the seatbelt signs on for the whole flight (because of non-existent ""turbulence"") and would not even serve water. In contrast, the final leg of my trip (Toronto to London) was on a codeshare operated by Air Canada and was thoroughly excellent. To summarise - basically, United Airlines is the long-haul Ryanair. Expect little, get little, but put up with it if they are the cheapest/only option.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-30;"Awful experience with United Airlines. First leg from SFO to IAD delayed by over an hour, but there still were some chances for me to make it for my connecting flight to Dublin. Near IAD, the pilot announced that we needed to wait in the air as both Washington airports had been closed due to ""two incidents"". After another 20 minutes, he informed that we were running out of fuel and need to land in Norfolk, to refuel and head to IAD when it's back open. Hearing this news, one of the passengers had medical emergency and the pilot decided to land on the closed airport anyway. Obviously, half of the passengers have missed their connections and when I finally reached the counter after two hours of waiting, I was rebooked for the next day. And guess what, United Airlines refused to provide hotel voucher as they claimed the delay was due to ""medical emergency"". This was an obvious lie, as medical emergency actually allowed us to land faster on the closed airport and the fellow passengers were livid. The reps mentioned only that ""this is what we see in our system and we can't do anything"". It's absolutely outrageous to use someone's medical emergency as the excuse to get away without facing responsibility for the delay. It's also interesting how our connecting flights were able depart on time if the airport was closed. The seats were quite comfy, the inflight service was virtually non-existent.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-30;"This was my first experience with United Airlines in probably 10 years or so, and I promise it will be my last. The flight from Savannah to Washington D.C. was awful. First sign of terrible service began on arrival at terminal check in. Every one of their systems were down. My sisters flight was no where to be found. Being frequent flyers we arrived early and it took 45 minutes to locate all our tickets and get us on our way. Lady was nice but by no means cordial in the way other customer service reps are. Our flight was delayed and upon arrival we missed our connecting flight to Munich. I know this happens and obviously causes frustration. However, this was only the start of it all. No flights were available until the following day. I am writing this review from the hotel in real time. When asked if we would be reimbursed for the hotel or upgraded for our inconvenience the rep literally laughed in my face and said that isn't our problem. I have never been more angry with a rep in my entire life. I spent 2 hours trying to call customer service and to my dismay was only able to speak to someone who clearly had just learned English a few months prior.  Unbelievable disregard for customer satisfaction. As a Delta sky miles member I will never betray my airline again (this international flight was cheaper through United. Not worth the 350 dollar savings). I honestly can't comprehend with human logic how this company still exists. I am appalled and will never ever give 1 dollar to United Airlines again. I have never written a review for anything before. That tells you how livid I am with this sham of a company, if you can even call it that.";NEGATIVE

They serve welcome champagne in plastic cups. The 2-1-2 seats are cramped, especially when you’re trying to sleep. I intentionally took the centre single seat, although I always sit by the window, for I didn’t want to be stepping over unknown people when heading for the bathroom. The colors of the interior are drab and dull - gray and mute blue. Could they not at least add some colorful dinnerware or napkins or blankets or pillow. Spice up the cabin. I will say that the meal options have improved. The dinner menu was rather good. Midway through the flight I had asked a FA when will United get rid of their 767’s for they are old planes. The one we were flying on was 15 years old. I hope that United will bring back the joy and luxury of flying some day. It would really make me smile and not dread flying them.";NEGATIVE

Was told 4 times on Roatan flight that agents waiting for us to help with connections as a lot of passengers had. No one at Houston and they did not get us forward in queues to get connections when other passengers were on later flights so had more time!

Great AVOD, I believe the inbound flight was NRT-DEN, so definitely a plane designed for international routes, but it was fun to be on for this short flight.

The menu had 3 entree selections for a 14 hour flight - all disgusting with heavy cream sauces to mask the inedible food. Not even a wine list was provided, in first class on a $12,000 ticket! The extremely senior cabin crew were out of shape and very uninterested in providing service, with one banging into my seat throughout the flight. Lavatory was absolutely disgusting - never once did a flight attendant attempt to keep it tidy.  Breakfast was a joke - two choices and lucky to get a banana with my cereal! Juice was canned concentrate. Not even cappuccino or espresso. How does United Airlines  pass this embarrassment off and justify the ticket price on such a high profile route? ";NEGATIVE

Starting from IFE to food everything had some sort of problem. For 11 hours flight, the seats are not equipped with seat-back screens. If you you want to entertain yourself only way is to to pay and purchase internet. So I did, but this time after few hours all my devices run out of energy but plug did not work under the seat. Food was just ok. Shortly after take off cabin crew delivered cracks and after about 1.5 half dinner was served. I decided to have chicken but it tasted like nothing.

The entertainment screen looked like one from 20 years ago: touch screen, but you press five times and it still goes to the wrong button. However, they had a decent selection of movies and shows. I tried to play a movie but it kept freezing every five minutes. At first I thought it was just mine who had problems, so I pushed the call button for a flight attendant. 30 minutes later, no sign of any flight attendant, I gave up and already prepared to sleep for the remaining 12 hours of the flight. It turned out later, it was an issue with the whole entertainment system on that flight. After they reset the system, which took another 20 minutes, mine worked ok, but I know I was one of those lucky ones. The food onboard was terrible.  I was pretty hungry but still didn't finish any of the meals they gave me. Well, they got me to Tokyo in one piece, so at least there's that.

We are a family of 6 and decide to volunteer and have to wait in line for 20 minutes - abandoning this when they say they don't need volunteers.  When we board, they say that will change all our seats because the plane got switched and we are a party of 6, and none of our seats are together - not even in the same row! I was traveling with a teenager, my husband and 3 young kids. One was 8, one was 7, and one only 4. The person that checked the boarding pass said to ask the agent to make our seats together. The agent is rude and didn't help us. When we get on the plane we all have to sit seperately. When we ask staff if it is okay to switch our seats so at least someone can sit together, the crew tells us to sit down and stay in the seats that they gave us. I end up sitting ""near"" (not next to) my 4 year old and next to my 6 year old. My husband sits 3 rows back near my 8 year old. My teenager has to sit alone with strangers, 4 rows back.

We battled headwinds across the Atlantic but still managed to arrive fifteen minutes ahead of schedule. I had row 7 (the emergency door exit) all to myself, which makes any flight pleasant. The cabin crew was attentive, the lunch service was satisfactory, and the inflight entertainment worked well. I would like to see United Airlines put sparkling wine back on the menu, at least available for purchase. If European low cost airlines can manage to offer this option, certainly United Airlines could too.";POSITIVE

I was reading and hadn't noticed they were serving, I had a package shook in front of my face, asking me if I wanted it or not! The entertainment screens were not working the whole of our flight.  We were delayed while sat on the plane on our return flight, with no communication at all. The food on the plane was the worst we have ever been served. We have traveled cheap airlines in Europe, and they are so much better than United. I would not recommend.";NEGATIVE

I will never partake in this horrible United Airlines service again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-14;A reasonable overall experience on this flight from Chicago to Los Angeles with United Airlines. In ORD the priority lanes at the TSA checkpoint were not clearly signposted. The United Club was over-crowded and pretty basic. The flight was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft from MCO. Boarding was quick and efficient and pre-departure drinks were offered. The cabin crew were really friendly and attentive and offered excellent inflight service. The seat was comfortable and a standard domestic first class product. Food and beverage service was good and regular refills were offered. IFE was DirecTV which offered a varied selection of live TV and recorded movies. Although the aircraft was equipped for Wi-fi the system was not working on this flight. Baggage delivery in LAX took ages!;POSITIVE

They send an e-mail, not mentioning the problems inside the plane. Absolutely horrible.";NEGATIVE

The seats were wide enough for me but not as wide as on Lufthansa or Swiss. ";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-14;"United Airlines flight from San Francisco to London was by far the most irritating, they had pre-booked heavily and hence when asked for seat options the guy in the ground very rudely asked us to take the next flight - we were stuck with the middle seat. They have only 1 bag check in (which is not followed by other airlines), so please don't pack heavily if you are travelling with United flights or else be prepared to pay 100$ extra for the luggage, I saw a college girl literally cry because she had no money. Coming to the food, well don't expect much, they have very limited options - only the salad is nice rest we liked nothing. Infant, this was the worst flight food we ever had. They have cheap flights, but the services are even below standard hence its better if you have a long journey try and book with some other airlines. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-13;"Not a friendly or helpful face in sight for our whole United Airlines experience from Houston to Seattle and back. I will not bore you with the details of misinformation that caused us to miss our first flight only to be wait listed and after waiting 4 hours discover that we had been misinformed again and the flight was oversold - which means we never stood a chance of getting on that flight! It was the last flight out and after witnessing the drama of 3 people with tickets being told they were not going home that night, we went home with tickets for the next day. We were told to be at the gate an hour early. My complaint is about the lack of concern for the comfort of the passengers. On our flight out it was warm for the entire flight. I requested that the air be adjusted and was told by the steward that he ""would look into it"". It never improved but I decided to just ignore it. However, on the flight back the whole trip was very warm - even with full air on it never cooled down. I asked the steward to please have the air lowered and he said ""he would look into it"" after another hour I walked through the cooler first class section and asked a different steward to make our cabin cooler and guess what, he said ""I'll look into it"". The cabin never became comfortable and several folks mentioned as they deplaned how hot the flight was! The attitude I picked up was we (the paying passengers) were just cargo that needed to be loaded - secured - and unloaded. Our comfort during the flight was a non-issue and the response they uniformally gave spoke of training of redirection and not of any effort to adjust anything. I will not be United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

There were foods and beverages for purchase only.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-11;I have been flying United Airlines for years and I do not expect much from their domestic service. I did expect something better than what I experienced between Washington Dulles and Tokyo Narita. There is a reason why this flight was only about half full - people know to use the competition. The food on the flight was horrible. It consisted of rice and bad scraps of chicken.  The flight attendants were indifferent. It was depressing to see a great US company perform so badly.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-11;"The worst experience ever. I flew United Airlines first class from Orlando to San Francisco and back. There are a number of issues that made me really unhappy - I am a frequent flyer, pay for my flights (no upgrades) and I am certainly not a complainer, but this was just too much. The airplane was not clean, there were stains on my seat, the back rest of the seat in front of me and on the table. This was already bad, but to top it off - there is no more inflight entertainment on United flights. When I say this I mean no more tv screens and headphones. United Airlines apparently took out all their entertainment hardware and replaced it with their new inflight entertainment - here is how that goes: you have to bring your own personal device and your own headphones. Then you have to lock into their wifi system at which point you can choose from their entertainment options. In first class wifi is free, but you have to pay in coach. So here is my issue with that: I do not have a personal device, all I have is a laptop and a phone. I certainly do not want to watch a movie on my tiny phone screen and did not bring a charging cable for my laptop. So I had no entertainment on a 5 hour flight. This is ridiculous. What about the travelers who do not have a PD? Congratulations United, - you found another way to rip off your customers.";NEGATIVE

Never took a moment to check on passengers. When passengers started asking questions about connecting flights, she said I have no idea about other flights. I only know about this one and we are stuck here. So we missed our connecting flight. Stayed the night in DC. Now we are waiting to board the flight the next day. The plane has been at the gate for an hour and they continue to say there's a boarding delay because of cleaning the plane. I feel sure we will miss our connecting flight once again. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-10;"San Francisco to Bozeman Yellowstone International with United Airlines was one of the worst travel experiences that I have had. All of the flights were either late or got changed and we did not receive a new itinerary. They recognized that it was their fault so they put us up for the night. Little did we know that we were given a voucher for 1 room with a full bed and a pull out couch for 5 people. To add insult to injury when talking with a customer service agent I was offered $50 per ticket for the hassle. I told them that that was a ""slap in the face"". I then requested a management call back. I have been waiting over a month for that call and when I finally call am told that I need to call the customer service line and leave a message. Great service United - maybe this is why you have such a low rating.";NEGATIVE

However,it was a totally different experience. The seats were smaller and less legroom, I wish I could remember which type of aircraft it was. The seatback screens were tiny and had less choice. The meal was disgusting apart from the icecream and for breakfast we were offered a cold (almost frozen) croissant. My main issue though was the crew member who 'served' me. She never cracked a smile once. Nor any interaction at all apart from ""chicken or pasta"" and a very interrogative ""drink?"" She did neither greet or farewell any passengers and treated us like an inconvenience. However on departing the plane which had an exceptionally smooth landing at LHR the pilot bade us farewell and thanked us for flying United Airlines - I guess he's the one that really matters.";NEGATIVE

The lunch which was supposed to be served was announced as ""We will be serving snacks on this flight."" A quick pass through by a totally disinterested flight attendant offering a tray of tiny bags of potato chips. On a previous flight they ran out of a breakfast selection after only taking four orders. The staff lacked any real interest in their passengers both times. There was a definite feeling that we were intruding on their time. I don't need a lot of service, but a touch of interest would be nice, instead of having to listen to the Attendants have lengthy personal chats in the galley.";NEGATIVE

I smiled and she smiled back and my ticket was re issued without question for the next flight to RDU. United flight left and arrived on time. Inflight service was limited to hot coffee for me and it was most welcome. Crew were professional, polite and efficient. Seat was comfortable with ample leg room. No complaints, great flight will ride United Airlines again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-08;"My flight with United Airlines from Los Angeles to Saipan and back was a terrible experience. Both directions we had mechanicals that delayed the flight overnight in one case, and 11 hours in the next. In rebooking my flight from Narita to San Francisco it resulted in my being up for 20 hours waiting. I am currently sitting wait for my flight to leave and don't have the faith that it will. My flight from Guam on a Boeing 737 had only one bathrrom open for economy class. There was a line to use the restroom half way down the plane. When the seat belt sign went on everyone ignored it in order to keep their place in line. No flight attendant even tried to get people to sit down. If I can help it, I will never fly United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE

Never ever again with this airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-07;"We boarded our aircraft early for our 09.25 flight to New York for our 4 day break. At 09.10 we were told there was a technical problem. We sat on the plane for over 4 hours with only 2 crackers and half a glass of water served. Eventually we were told to leave the plane and ground staff would give us further instructions. The ground staff hadn't even been told we were leaving the plane. Eventually after collecting our luggage we were put on a bus to an awful hotel. We were collected by bus the following morning and taken back to the airport. A member of staff was handing out airline compensation forms, but when we asked if the plane was fixed, she snapped not to harass her as she had worked a double shift and was stressed. When we said we were stressed and just wanted to know if we would be travelling that day, she called over security who threatened if there was any problems, he controlled who got on the plane and who didn't. Disgraceful behaviour to everyone who were now delayed 24 hours. We eventually arrived in New York 26 hours late and in rush hour, so our 4 days was reduced to 2! United Airlines have since sent an email offering compensation but the 2nd page with all the information was missing so none the wiser but I'm guessing judging by previous reviews it will be a travel voucher. After emailing them they now seen unaware of our plight. Wouldn't recommend United Airlines to anyone.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-07;"I flew with United Airlines four times in one week, two of the flights were overbooked. This is ridiculous.

This was discouraging the first time, but having experienced this twice in one week is unacceptable. United Airlines has lost my business and I will discourage others from flying with them.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-06;"This was a 12 hour flight with United Airlines from Hong Kong to San Francisco and we got a small meal 1 hour into the flight and small tray of food with an hour of the flight left. Besides that they didn't come around with snacks or drinks. The food was bad, neither one of us could finish it. The seats are very uncomfortable for any flight but especially for 12 hours. I had requested a seat before leaving on the trip, but when I went to check in I didn't get the aisle seat that I had picked, but the inside seat in the last row of the plane. On my flights from San Francisco to Denver and Denver to Fargo we didnt get snacks and barely got a drink. This is in comparison to Air Niugini who I flew to Hong Kong with who were excellent. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-06;"United Airlines give no preference to frequent flyers and provide an abysmal excuse for customer service. They sat our entire family apart from one another although the reservations were made together. I called about 2 weeks ahead of the flight to ensure we were seated together, and was assured that our seat preferences were noted. I checked in online 24 hours in advance and when I got to the baggage drop at the airport the rude check in assistant informed me that I hadn't checked in, and therefore hadn't been allocated a seat. I produced the email noting my check in time to which he responded, ""that must have been a technical error."" I was pretty much in disbelief of how rude every representative we dealt with was. Before taking a long haul flight with United Airlines I would also take into consideration that they don't provide hot meals, just pretzels and small snacks. Also no in flight entertainment on an 11 hour flight. I fly to London twice a year and will never make the mistake of taking a United Airlines flight again. Overall completely disappointing experience.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-05;"I haven't flown United Airlines in a while and I don't plan on using them again anytime soon. Our luggage was the same weight (give or take 5lbs) heading to San Francisco from Hartford as it was going from San Francisco to Hartford but we paid $100 more when checking our luggage on our way home. Note the price difference was not due to being in a different weight class, even though our luggage did fluctuate by 7lbs when placed on the same scale 2 different times within mere minutes. On our way home I was excited to see TVs on the back of each seat which faded quickly as soon as I realized I couldn't watch a single thing unless I swiped my credit card. Sorry any motivation I would have had to shell out $7.99 to watch any kind of entertainment was obliterated by having to pay $125 for 1 check bag for both my husband and I.  Our connecting flight departure time was changed numerous times due to ""awaiting aircraft"". Ending in over an hour delay. No thank you United Airlines, I did not enjoy our experience together and will not be using United Airlines again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-05;"I flew United Airlines from LHR to MCO via IAH in Economy Plus, on their Boeing 787-8. United Airlines Economy Plus product is simply the economy class seat but with an additional 3 or so inches of leg room. The economy plus product is only worth buying if you want that extra room but in my opinion I don't believe there's much difference between that and the economy product. I flew economy back and didn't really find it much different. My wife, son and I are all average height and weight so don't require any extra leg room. The main problem is that the seat is far too thin and as such doesn't provide much support. I know this is a design improvement to lower the weight of the aircraft, but it doesn't help your back on those long flights - LHR to IAH is 10 hours or so. I normally fly business class for work for transatlantic flights (SFO and JFK) around four or five times a year on BA's 747-400 or Virgin's A346 or 747-400 and flying the 787-8 is by far the best craft I've been on. I felt the freshest and the least dehydrated on this craft. In summary, I don't think economy plus is worth the upgrade cost but if you have an extra $150 dollars or so then go for it.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2015-09-04;"We flew United Airlines for the first time using our Air Canada Aeroplan miles. Both segments of our flight from Vancouver to Honolulu were excellent, aircraft were clean and the service was better than other reviews of this airline. I was most impressed with one female flight attendant that had two passangers (a couple) remove their luggage from the front of the premium economy overhead compartment walking further back in the aircraft where they were seated. This has become common practice such that they can simply grab their carryon luggage without carrying it from the back of the aircraft. Surrounding passangers raised a bravo to that flight attendent. The crew on both flights were excellent. We did not have to pay for pillow, blanket and headsets. Perhaps they were included in our Premium economy seating. Our seats were very good with good leg room - Row 17 Window and Aisle. We were very impressed with the safety presentation. Grabs your attention. Well done United. Overall we were most impressed and will certainly consider flying to Hawaii next year with United Airlines.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-09-03;"This seems almost pointless. United Airlines couldn't careless about my family while speaking on the phone, so it is hard to believe they would take the time to check their reviews. This is a fluid matter and we expect to fly tomorrow, but I have serious doubts. We are traveling with a 14 month old, a 5 year old and a 7 year old, and we paid extra so that we could sit together and received confirmation to that affect. This was done two months ago. Today, the day before the flight, we received a ""check in"" email but when attempting this, the seats were scattered and the five year old was not even reflected to be on the plane. Needless to say, we called Customer Service and after an hour long phone call they could not or would not correct their admitted errors and admitted to charging us for something they then took away without notice. They suggested we handle this at the gate tomorrow. I have zero confidence. Traveling with kids is difficult enough, but enduring the childlike behavior from United Airlines is pathetic. So since this matter is still fluid and United Airlines has an opportunity to read their reviews, and perhaps correct their errors, I put them to the challenge. If they correct it, I will go out of my way to amend this rating. If they do not, I will follow up accordingly. ";NEGATIVE

United.com is ridiculously overpriced. I went again in the summer thinking one bad trip can't color my perception of United Airlines. This time it was just as awful and all the calls I made prior to flying to avoid the same issues were treated as an annoyance. However, when things went poorly and my child's stroller was lost, they were dismissive and eventually ""escalated"" it to give me another $100 voucher. It's been 6 weeks since I returned and apparently they are still ""looking"" for the stroller and I shouldn't call back before another 5 weeks!";NEGATIVE

On my flight from Paris to Newark, I was on a 757-200. It's always strange to cross the Atlantic on a single-aisle jet but the flight was very pleasant, the flight attendants were nice. The Inflight Entertainment included seatback screens that worked perfectly, aswell as onboard WiFi and Media Server. The WiFi was sadly not working, which is a pity. The food was okay, I mean, it's airline food, and it was average. The seats were old, and so, fairly comfortable compared to the new seats that seem to get thinner and thinner. Newark Hub is decent. Just wish I didn't have to use my credit card to get some WiFi. My flight from Newark to Dallas was on a 737-800. Wasn't as good as the previous one, but it's a regional flight. I think paying 4$ for a small can of Pringles is nuts. There was seatback screens (DirectTV) and the WiFi and Media Server were working fine. The cost of the WiFi was okay. The seats were modern and comfortable enough. Flights attendants were nice. Then it was the usual business at Dallas airport waiting half an hour to get our luggages.

To my luck, I got two curry meals again on the return flight. I have learned that my allergy was recorded on their data bank. In this high speed communication era, I could be easily contacted via e-mail or call if my ""allergy issues"" can't be accommodated. I could have brought my own food for this cross pacific flight.

However, United Airlines new ""slimline"" seating wasn't pleasant, but EconomyPlus made up for it. Service was basic, with complimentary beverages. Entertainment was DirecTV, but it was useless on an hour flight. The plane arrives early to O'Hare. The United Club at C Terminal was okay, offering decent food and WiFi. The 737-700 to Bozeman was not what I had in mind. It wasn't very clean and had some trash in the seat pockets. The cloth seats didn't help either. But EconomyPlus at the bulkhead offered extra comfort, and the DirecTV was enjoyable, however movies weren't on-demand. The flight arrived on-time to Bozeman with a gorgeous approach.

Unlike younger travelers, who may have considered carrying the extra 9 lbs, she was not able to do so. With less an hour before her flight was scheduled to take off, we were in no position to argue about United Airlines extortion of money from customers.

The plane was so dated and old that there was no back of seat entertainment, only a selection of films and TV on the big screen. This is ridiculous for a 10 hour flight in the 21st century. Whilst queuing to board, an employee gave us some leaflets about ""Personal Device Entertainment"" ie you can download their selection of films etc via the UA app. The impression we were given was that this was not instead of seat back screens, but was an additional courtesy service. The colleague also told us that ""it was probably too late to download the app now, but here's the details anyway."" Appalling. As a result I had a mobile phone with very little battery life (no inflight chargers), no time to download an app, and no internet access (available for an additional 17USD, which is not far off what I pay for a whole month's WiFi). I had my young son with me, for whom much of the big screen entertainment was unsuitable (House MD, Aloha, some dreadful programme about how money affects our psyche). It was the longest most boring and uncomfortable flight I have ever had. Don't get me started on United Airlines food. They had three options on our previous flight on the way out, but only one left- chicken and potatoes, but without the potatoes. The rest of the food was barely edible, with semi frozen bread rolls and synthetic over packaged over processed snacks in several layers of cellophane that could probably last five years without refrigeration.

The flight from HGK to Chicago, though, is a nightmare. Dirty aircraft, in-flight entertainment doesn't work properly, and the FAs are rude and condescending. They missed me, and this is the second time actually, while serving dinner. When I pointed it out I was met with a smirk and the FA basically tossed a cold dinner on my tray.

The children had a good experience with Air Canada, they were able to charge their phones on the flight, Air Canada inflight entertainment was also very good. Our conclusion is that we won't fly United Airlines again after today's experience. Good luck to whoever does!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-29;"I have taken buses that were better equipped for long travel. This was shockingly bad. The ""entertainment"" on a 12+ hour flight from Chicago to Tokyo consisted of failed TV pilots and box office duds. If you wanted to watch anything decent you had to download their app which was impossible as the wifi kept cutting out after less than a minute. They offer web service for $17.00 which was suggested to me to try in order to watch the ""free"" movies. Classic ambush. They charge you for food in between the free meals which were over 9 hours apart. Just a brutal experience. Staff were passable but weren't good enough to compensate. Never again.";NEGATIVE

Took a flight from Amsterdam to Houston with a connection to Salt Lake City. Flew back from San Diego to Houston with connection to Amsterdam. Legroom on the domestic US flights a bit limited but no complaints while flying over the Atlantic. Had an almost two hour delay on the flight from Houston to Amsterdam of which we where informed already quite early and about which we received several updates. Made up some of the time during the flight. Cabin staff were friendly and catered to all of our needs with no exception. Food and drinks in adequate quantity. Quality not different from what I have experienced with most other airlines. This was the first time I flew with United and I have no reason not to fly with them again.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2015-08-27;"Outbound EWR-LHR was a ""United"" Crew and service was fairly attentive to a full cabin. United has set up Biz Class in the B-767-300's as half the seats facing f'wd and half aft. Entertainment systems are set up in groups of four, two in each direction. Which means seat partners face in same direction. Although fairly tight for business class, lie-flat seats are comfortable. Food was average for an Atlantic run (nobody beats Aer Lingus) and timekeeping accurate. Return run was with a ""Continental"" crew on B-777 (No. 0001, the ""Gordon Bethune"" -wonder if they've got one named after Frank Lorenzo, LOL) with only two classes (Biz First and Coach), and service was first rate. The ""Continental"" pride still shows. EWR hub is working better than ever (and it's not an easy hub to deal with in the best of times).";NEGATIVE

I am quite tall so I need the extra leg room. However, I have to say most of the planes I got to fly in were very old, some with zero back of the seat entertainment (especially on flights from Chicago to Asia) and those that had back of the seat entertainment were on tiny screens where the films were looped. I cant figure out why United flies these poor planes on their long haul routes. In addition, the food on this airline is extremely bad - especially the breakfast. ";NEGATIVE

Then they cancelled the flight and had to put me on a flight out of LAX instead. Instead of a couple of hours of traveling time, United Airlines made it a 12 hour travel day. A little girl was crying her eyes out, because she wouldn't make it to something very important. I understand that flights get cancelled, but they were not courteous nor expedient. No reimbursement or anything, if I had been late to something also, I would be doing much more than just a bad review.";NEGATIVE

Philadelphia to San Francisco there was no entertainment (6+ hour flight), complimentary drinks and snacks, cabin space was ok. Given no entertainment, this flight seemed longer than expected.

As we checked in, the staff member at the counter said we weren't on the flight. After 45 min of sitting and arguing they finally decided to honor the tickets (that were already paid for), but they said we couldn't make the 6.00 flight, because it was leaving in 10 min.

united-airlines;2015-08-25;"I was on flight UA1538 scheduled to depart EWR today 8/23/15 to West Palm Beach. My experience was nothing short of horrendous. I, along with many of the passengers on this flight, were appalled at the lack of customer service and communication regarding this flight. We boarded and deplaned twice over a 3 hour span due to mechanical problems, first waiting to see if there was another plane available or if the plane could be fixed, until it was declared that the flight was cancelled. Employee at the gate got said ""your flight is cancelled, go to customer service."" No other information was given, no concierge came to speak with us, we were on our own with no other information about where to go, the luggage, departing flight alternatives, procedures, overnight accomodations, nothing. I asked a baggage handler what happened to our luggage, he said it would come off at carousel 9. Carousel 9 was under construction and another baggage personel told us that the bags were going on another flight to West Palm ahead of us. They put a call in to get my luggage and said, go to carousel 8. After another hour and a half later, the bags were still not there. Over a 5 hour span, there was no customer service to address any issues. I finally tracked down my luggage and proceeded to customer service to get an alternative flight. I was told everything was booked until the following evening. My friends looked online and found a few sooner flights with JetBlue. I finally got another flight reservation at 11.30 tomorrow morning, a connecting flight that will now take me 5.5 hours to fly a 2.5 hour route. I am amazed at the miscommunication and complete lack of compensation or customer attention afforded by United. Their personnel had no idea of anything, we all got different answers to the same questions and felt completely abandoned by United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-24;"My family and I were flying from London to Hawaii via Los Angeles. It was a 10 hour and 20 minute flight to Los Angeles and we were given only one meal. However on this particular aircraft we were given inflight entertainment which was brilliant. You could watch films, TV shows, Music videos, play games, all sorts, and they could be paused and rewinded. However the flight from LA to Honolulu was terrible. This was a 5 hour flight and we were given no food, food was available to buy but it basically cost an arm and a leg. There was inflight entertainment but you had to pay a ridiculous amount of money for it. On our 5 hour flight from Honolulu to San Francisco we were, again, given no food, however this time the inflight entertainment was free and was very good. On our flight from San Francisco back to London Heathrow, which was another 11 hour flight, we were given no inflight entertainment whatsoever. Not even a screen. There were communal screens, but what they were showing wasn't necessarily what everybody wanted to watch. It certainly wasn't what I wanted to watch. Overall I felt the flight attendant service was poor. They don't seem to be aware of their passengers. On many occasions when the attendant came by with a bin bag to collect the rubbish, we were just ignored, they didn't even turn to us to see if we had anything that needed putting in the bin. The seats were relatively comfortable but there was very little leg room. But all aircrafts were clean. Every flight that we were on departed late. It was my first time flying with United Airlines and, overall, I was very disappointed and will not be flying with them again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-23;"This was my first time flying United and I was a little apprehensive given the number of negative reviews. I did some searching in the internet prior to departing and found they use the 767-300 on the LHR-ORD route. A 25 year old 767. It shows. The cabin is extremely dated. One fellow passenger described the IFE as being like a 'sat nav' which I thought was an accurate description. Tiny, low def screen with no touch screen on demand facilities. Just films and music in a loop. I did like the ATC channel, however. The food was horrible. I know airline food is never great but I'll eat anything so it must have been bad. Additional snacks had to paid for. The crew were decent. They were polite and happy. I've flown transatlantic a fair few times and have found Delta, Virgin and BA all deliver a better service on nicer planes. Don't think I'll be using United again for this route until they up their game a little.";NEGATIVE

Our flight only departed 30 minutes late but that's normal for Newark and we arrived on time into Frankfurt. The aircraft was clean and the flight attendants were friendly and spoke multiple languages. I didn't eat the food but the choice of dinner on this route was between pasta and chicken. We were also given a snacks and drinks after takeoff and before landing. The inflight entertainment was also really good. There was a wide range of movies, shows, games, and music. The seats on the other hand weren't comfortable for sleeping and somehow, mine wasn't able to stay reclined. I'm 5' 3"" so I can't complain about the legroom. My only issue would be at check in, the workers appeared to be miserable. I prefer European airlines over any American airline, but if the fare is right, I'll fly United again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-23;"Highly disappointed, as a family of 5 we were travelling to and from Orlando with United Airlines from London  Heathrow. There had been a 4 hour delay travelling to Orlando due to technical issues and on our return journey 3 weeks later (20th Aug) there had been worse delays. Unfortunately a passenger took ill and an emergency landing was necessary to assist. Most passengers ended up sleeping in the airport, some with children. The airport was cold and we requested blankets however no response was offered re this request. The airline refused to assist with accomodation or vouchers for food, although before we landed the pilot informed passengers that those connecting would be assisted in this manner. The supervisor or service director, as called in the States, was so contentious and disrespectful towards passengers and made a comment saying that the pilot had no 'idea what he was talking about' regarding assistance with accomodation etc. This clearly showing lack of professionalsm on the part of the supervisor and lack of skills in overall customer services displayed by staff. No information had been shared with passengers and after queing for over 2 hours were told that our option would be to spend the rest of the morning (as it was 2am) in the airport. To top it off the next morning our flight was also delayed by almost 3 hours due to mechanical problems. I will not recommend this airline.";NEGATIVE

The seats were cramped with no leg rests at all. My husband and I each fly over 150,000 miles per year and this was one of the worst flights. I was cold (no blankets to be found, apparently you have to request them) and luckily we had our own headphones as no headphones were passed out. There were no waters given for a five and a half hour flight as on other airlines we fly and the flight attendants only came through for drink requests once before the flight left and once during dinner service, other times I had to request refills of my water. I am surely not looking forward to my return flight this weekend.";NEGATIVE

Overall the service was ok but inconsistent, and some seats are too small for even average sized customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-17;"I booked with this airline because they used to be pretty good - I even paid a little extra for United. Experience: Food is awful on international flights. I was initially happy to see a gluten-free option for my meal, but it was dreadful. For breakfast they gave me a gluten-free cookie. My son (3 years old) received the ordinary meals and he did not like it. Our flight had 2 crew members for all of the economy section (for both Economy Plus and regular Economy). Food took forever to roll out and the beverage service was even longer. I bought 2 seats (1 for my 3 year old child and another for my 10 month old). I told United (on the phone, at the customer service desk, and also at the check-in desk) that when the child car seats are put into the plane seats, the person in the front cannot recline for their 7 hour flights. Each and every time they said they did not have the power to move me to the bulkhead. I accepted and sure enough this caused some frustration for the person who couldn't recline - and this happened on both the outgoing and incoming flights. I will fly anyone other than United.

There was a delay for all of the 4 planes I flew on, and on the way there, there was a 2 hour delay. On the way back, there was a 1 hour delay and we sat in the plane while they fixed the air conditioning, and it was incredibly hot. I understand that they had to fix the plane's air conditioning, but they should have done that before we got on the plane and had to sit in that heat for an hour. Then I missed my connecting flight, and I got on a new flight (after talking to a very rude lady at customer service), and that flight was delayed because they didn't have any flight attendants for that plane, so they had to wait over an hour until they could get a new flight crew to come. I had an absolutely miserable experience with United for all 4 of my flights with them, and I will never fly with United again.";NEGATIVE

No music, no personal screen, nothing. Instead, United Airlines thinks they can satisfy customers by putting super tiny full cabin projectors, virtually impossible to see clearly from a window (in this case ""wall"") seat that is farthest away from the screen, and play movies on them. I was okay with the movie selections, but little kids see this too, and most are PG-13. Very cramped seats with minimal recline made the trip even more uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi was not good either. Food was the ordinary stuff you get from United Airlines. Bathrooms take way too long to wait for, wherever you go. There are lines everywhere. Staff weren't very kind either. I will definitely avoid United Airlines Boeing 747s, if not United Airlines itself.";NEGATIVE

We were then booked on different flights - I mean 3 of us were booked on one flight and one of the 15 year old girls were booked on a separate flight. We called to correct this and were booked together on a flight, but when we got to the gate they had only 3 seats! Thus, I had to send the women ahead of me, even though the only adult had really never flown, is afraid of planes, and was nearly in tears going onto the plane. Not to mention that I am their only way home once they get to their destination. I talked with a supervisor, and her response was I am sorry and the conversation is over. ";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-08-15;"Boarding the plane was no problem. An old United Airlines Boeing 747 but clean and in good condition. Was sitting beside the galley which was very noisy for most of the flight. Food was standard, I had a vegetarian pasta dish for lunch. It was ok, but small. Pre-landing snack was a turkey sandwich which was passable. I was surprised to see snacks being sold during the flight between meals. Other airlines would give out snacks for free on an 11 hour flight. Most of the flight crew were unfriendly and there was little communication from pilots or crew. The biggest disappointment was the entertainment. United Airlines do not have seat back entertainment on their 747's in economy. Instead there were just a few screens around the cabin. The screens were too far away from most seats, especially if you were sitting nearer the windows. Very disappointing that in 2015, a major airline would still operate like this on a long-haul flight. Fortunately I had laptop with me to access entertainment from United Airlines website, but on a number of occasions, internet access cut out stopping the films. Overall, a disappointing experience. In future, I will try and stay away from American carriers on transatlantic routes as European airlines offer much better service.";NEGATIVE

We were onboard and taxiing for take-off in no time. The flight attendants were smiley and happy to help. Food was basic but enjoyable, a choice of chicken or beef. The in-flight entertainment system was a tad dated but had all the up-to-date films and TV shows. Free earphones were handed out at the start of both flights. Unfortunately as we did not book our seats, we were left with the row in front of the exit row which meant we could not recline at all so next time I would reserve them. Having said this, on our return flight, we were in row 40 (right at the back) and the recline was perfect and we didn't have anyone behind us. Taxiing after landing at Newark took a while (no fault of United) and disembarking was a little bit lengthy. Due to the plane being a narrow body (3-3 layout) it made the flight feel a bit cramped, however, as there were 3 of us travelling together, it meant we could all sit together. Overall, a great transatlantic service with United. Would fly with them any day of the week.";POSITIVE

The leg room was good and this made for a very comfortable experience. The staff on the flight itself were friendly and approachable.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-08-13;"The flight was delayed progressively from 45 minutes to 2 hours, which meant that all passengers with shorter connections than 2 hours would miss our connecting flights.

The gate staff was basically put on the spot when other passengers and I had already looked into our options online and they would have no choice but to at least check for availability. In short: terrible customer service at the gates. Eventually I was re-routed to Denver after discovering that both the Chicago and the Houston flights (second option) were oversold. The plane to Denver was old and not well kept. On top of that, one of the gate employees wanted to check all of the wheeled carry-on luggage of boarding group 4, even when she was told many of us had short connections. I was not going to risk having my carry-on stayed in Denver at this point. In addition, when we arrived in Denver the flight that was departing from the nearby gate to Eugene, OR was canceled for crew reasons. United Airlines need to solve their staff, crew and airplane issues. By the way, none of the flight delays could be explained by bad weather.";NEGATIVE

Our ordered children's meal never arrived since they discontinued it according to the flight attendant who spoke with me. the other flight attendant told a different story to the other families.

Upon boarding, we were informed that since my grandson was only 6 years old, he could not sit in the exit row. This information did not appear anywhere on the United Airlines website. He and his mother were changed to two premium seats in the front bulkhead and we were had to keep our two premium seats in the exit row over the engine, and with no window shades. The noise was unberable, and flying into the early morning sun with no window shade was blinding. The FA dealt with this situation by inserting a flight safety procedures card into the window frame and then a folded newspaper which kept falling out. No explanation or apology for the missing window shade was ever given. We asked twice to change seats, as ultimately did the couple sitting in the other two premium seats in the exit row. We finally received two premium seats but in separate parts of the cabin. When I asked the FA for a can of ginger ale, she responded that she would first have to serve the other pasengers and would give me the can only if she had any left over. Finally she brought me an opened can with a flat beverage. No other beverage service was offered, nor any food for purchase on the 3.5 hour flight. The disembarking in Toronto was at an off-gate location: we descended down a very steep stairs onto the unsheltered tarmac until our suitcases were unloaded, and were then required to walk on the tarnac for 20 minutes to the Customs area. This is not the first time that I have had a totally unacceptable experience flying with United Airlines, the last being in their Global First Class cabin to South America. United Airlines seems to be firmly in the lead in the race to the bottom, and is apparently determined to keep this unenviable position. Disgraceful, again!";NEGATIVE

We were told they were expecting us. Me, my wife, and my two small children ran across the airport. When we arrived we were told that they had sold our seats to stand by. The plane was delayed an additional 2 hours. My connecting flight actually left 8 hours later. We missed an entire day in Costa Rica.

They referred all of the passengers to a service area a few hundred yards away. The people at that service desk indicated that they were busy and would take hours to answer questions, and in turn referred us to another service desk that supposedly had no crowd. The second service desk was more crowded than the first but eventually got to us. They informed me that they could not get me to Baltimore that day but that they could get us to Washington and provide a shuttle to Baltimore, free of charge. We were then sent to a gate that had been double-booked. After United reassigned the gate (another cross-terminal jaunt), we learned the fight to Washington had been delayed. When we finally did arrive at Washington, the United attendants there indicated we were on our own to Baltimore.

I am 5 ft tall but it was impossible to move at all. My knees were jammed against the seat in front of me. My flight from Pittsburgh to Newark coming home on August 2nd was cancelled due to no crew being available. United rebooked me on a 5.30 am flight the next morning. I needed to be back Sunday night, so I called United to rebook. After waiting 40 minutes, I finally spoke to an agent and I was rebooked on Delta. Since I had already checked in to the original United Flight and paid a $25 baggage fee, I asked if I would have to pay an additional $25 to Delta. The answer was ""yes"" but in theory I could easily get a refund online. I spent 1.5 hrs on the phone with United attempting to do this. As I write this I am still on hold.";NEGATIVE

Only flight that did not have complimentary food and the available snacks to purchase were poor. This flight was 7.10 am so many hadn't eaten. Next flight to San Francisco slightly better, the air hostess was much friendlier. Inflight entertainment? What was that? Had to purchase earphones - entertainment woeful.

This trip we missed our connecting flight because we sat on the tarmack in Boston for an hour because they were having delays in loading luggage.  We missed our connecting flight by 10 minutes and are now stuck overnight in Denver. So let me see, they could have waited 5-10 minutes for us to make our scheduled flight, or not wait and pay hotel and food for two people. What kind of business sense is that? This was my last straw with United - I will avoid this airline at all costs. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-31;"My experience took a full 2 days when it should have taken only 15 hours. My family was booked with Delta. Our route was from PSA-JFK-ORD which would be operated by a 757-200. That aircraft was broken so we were rebooked with Lufthansa on a flight that would have taken us to PSA-MUC-ORD. Our flight to Munich was supposed to take off at 1pm, we waited 5 hours until we could board. The flight to Munich was operated by Air Dolomiti, we had a 1 hour 40 minute layover and I had a window seat on the long haul flight so I was happy. The boarding process was fast. Once we had boarded one passenger decided that he wanted to get off the plane, that took an hour but the crew handed out refreshments and candy while we waited. When we took off we were 1 hour 20 minutes behind schedule and I knew that we had missed our flight. Our only hope was that it too was delayed (which it wasn't). When we arrived at MUC there were vans that would take people right to their connection from the plane. Unfortunately ORD was not among the destinations. We, after spending 5 hours in a small airport had go and spend another hour in line at the Lufthansa desk. We were booked on a flight the next day with United Airlines. The next day we went to the United check-in and everything went smoothly. After the security checkpoint we had to do three more passport checks and one more baggage check before we were in departure for the U.S. Here we waited for 1.5 hours with no seats. We still hadn't gotten our seats so when last call had begun we marched up to the gate and demanded them. On the flight we had an 80's television and some okay food, nothing special. The seats were uncomfortable and I didn't sleep one bit. We arrived on time only to find a large amount of international arrivals so the arrivals area was chaotic. In the Baggage Hall there were mountains and rows of luggage just taken off the conveyor belt just to make space for more arrivals. Then once the luggage came we had to wait for at least an hour to go through the last inspection and then we we were home free. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-29;"Everytime I fly with this airline there is a 3 or more hour delay due to ""awaiting aircraft."" One time is was because the pilot was in a different city and had to get to Boston to fly out, which took 5 hours! Another time the plane was awaiting the crew which was coming from a different city apparently. Then the plane was just delayed leaving its first departure city and we were never told why just that as soon as it gets in we would be on our way. This is just ridiculous. First off I had a connection flight and was not notified of the delay. Secondly, they had no one at the desk to assist customers trying to find a new flight and when I finally found someone at a different gate, who was semi helpful, she informed me that the next flight out would be 15 mins before my new scheduled departure time. So in my experience this airline is all about delays if your current flight is coming from another city. I get it, things happen but this airline really needs to improve its punctuality. I only took this flight this time beacuse of my miles and I was disappointed again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-28;"I found all the staff I interacted with friendly and professional, the aircraft was clean, the food was fine but not enough. The seats were a nice size. I had never flown with United before and was pleasantly surprised. Although I was sat next to morbidly overweight people on both my flights the seats were big enough that the people next to me did not squeeze onto my seat like they usually do on Virgin flights which I liked. I was late getting to the gate (very much my fault) and the initial employee I spoke to was rude and short with me and refused to even see if I could make it to the flight even though my baggage was still on board and the food was not yet delivered to the plane, she told me ""no, you aren't getting on the flight"" and refused to even see if it was a possibility. Thank goodness for the other lady who phoned someone, told me I was fine to get on the plane because they were waiting for the food and my luggage was still aboard, and sent me through. I slept most of the flight to the UK. The touch screen with my seat on the way back to the USA was really finicky which was a bit annoying, I liked the selection of movies and that they played as soon as I was sat in my seat rather than waiting till after take off for them to work. I bought duty free stuff inflight and the staff that helped me were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this airline and will use it again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-28;"Delays were not announced to passengers in a timely manner and lack of assistance in order to accommodate or aide in booking other flights for customers to either reach their connecting flights or to their destinations was displeasing. The way the United Airlines handled my partner's luggage that was left behind at our originating destination was a stressful start to our trip. Upon arriving at the airport around 5.45pm to catch our 8.20pm flight, flight 5237, from Sacramento to Los Angeles, on Monday July 20 2015, we checked in promptly and breezed through security. We sat by the gate with a plane that sat there for as long as we had, little did we know this was our plane. By the time boarding came around, our flight was delayed for another hour, occurring multiple times for the next few hours. It was my hope that during the initial delay the service desk would help customers explore other options to reach connecting flights and/or destinations to avoid delays or issues upon arriving in Los Angeles. We were worried about missing our connecting flight the entire time. The second delay hits and people began to be frantic and changed flights. My party and I anxiously wondered if we were going to make our connecting flight or if we needed to rebook online. We called customer service a few times to inquire about alternative options but were never offered alternatives until hours later right before the last delay was lifted after 11am and needed to quickly decide on either taking the flight or flying out of another airport. I am baffled at the lack of customer service. My second and major complaint was the issue with our checked luggage getting left behind in Sacramento as we made our way to Cancun. We checked in before 6pm and sat at the terminal looking at the same airplane the entire time until we boarded it only to find out my luggage was never placed on the same plane. ";NEGATIVE

I mainly use United Airlines as I always found them to have competitive prices and good baggage allowances. However on my last few trips the free baggage allowance was reduced from two bags to one. Last week my bag was only 4 lbs overweight and I was charged the enormous amount of $200. I realise that there are reasons for charging for overweight bags, but there are plenty customers who are overweight and are not charged extra for seats and there was also lots of youngsters travelling with 2 large pieces of hand luggage struggling to carry bags along the aircraft walkway. I think it's wrong that an average size and weight customer gets charged a huge amount for a 4lb overweight bag.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-07-26;"United uses A320 on too many longer flights within the United States. They are annoying and uncomfortable. They ""upgraded"" their seats after merging with Continental which really means a downgrade. They crammed more seats on their airbus airplanes making legroom even more restricted. They removed all forms of entertainment from their fleet. I used to be able to listen to the radio in the armrests with my own headphones, but they removed them and I am incredibly bored, cannot get to sleep because of how uncomfortable the seats are now! They don't use the television screens that fold down anymore, they have incredibly rude and unhelpful employees. United Airlines is expensive for the quality of service you get. ";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-26;"As a child our family always flew United. However, it has gotten progressively worse through the years to the point that I would rather pay a more for a ticket than fly United ever again. Our family of 5 (one of whom was a special needs daughter) was to fly from Buffalo to Chicago to San Francisco to Anchorage where we were to then start our Alaskan cruise. Upon arriving at Buffalo, the check in machine didn't work right. The lady behind the counter was nice enough but said she could not help us with gate-to-gate connection (e.g. passenger carts) as that was something ""you didn't do"" and simply didn't seem to care that we had a need. In Chicago we sat on the tarmack for almost an hour before we took off, causing us to get in late in SF for our connecting flight to Anchorage. We ran to our gate as best we could with our special needs daughter, saw our plane sitting at the gate, but weren't allowed to get on due to the gangway being pulled away from the plane already even though the United personnel told us, ""Oh, we knew you were coming. We just couldn't wait for you.""  To make matters worse United booked us on a flight to Anchorage for the next night. In the end we got flights on Alaska Airlines and got into Anchorage about 2:30am which allowed us time to sleep in our booked hotel room before making the trip to Seward by bus, getting us there in plenty of time to board our ship. Alaska Airlines personnel were superb in demeanor, helpfulness, and care, something that United personnel were seriously lacking. Our return trip from Vancouver, BC to Buffalo started out much differently than when we went. The staff in Vancouver were helpful and courteous. But once we got to Chicago, they were anything but! I think the personnel of United Airlines in the US could take a few lessons from those from our Vancouver neighbors. We have had other unacceptable experiences in the past with United Airlines but this one takes the cake and is really the one that put us over the edge. No more United Airlines for this family!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-24;"Since there is only one flight a day to Aguadilla PR from Newark we have taken this flight a number of times, it is always late. In January, the delay was due to ""insufficient crew"" this time, the almost 1.5 hour delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"". This flight had incredibly cramped seats that are hard and have almost no recline. The pocket in fron of the seat was very low on the seat in front so that when I put my book in the pocket it bulged out so much that I had to keep my knees apart. The entertainment is only for a $7.99 fee per person, and there was only one offer of a four ounce cup of a liquid for the entire 3.5 hour flight. United planes are new so this uncomfortable seat situation is going to continue, I would avoid United if at all possible. Fares are also higher than other carriers.";NEGATIVE

The agent was very rude with my wife and refused to help and told her to talk to other passengers on the plane. We board the aircraft brand new to find that the seats were so close together that at 6 Feet tall my knees were in the seat in front of me and the entertainment system did not work. We board our second flight, I sit down and literally have the seat back cave in with an audible pop. The seats should have been replaced years ago by the time we got off the aircraft 5 hours later my wife and I could barley walk. Coming back and go to drop off the bags they had 6 lines going and one attendant, get our boarding passes and they had us divided up all over the aircraft, talked to the gate attendant his response we have been paging you and was very rude with us. I have a type one diabetic and a 3 yo that needs someone to ride with them, after fighting with them got it fixed meanwhile my other 2 children had to sit elsewhere on the plane and not with us.

Fifteen minutes before the flight my Dad received an email saying the flight was delayed until 2.30. I was annoyed but ok about the 2 hour wait. Then he received another email saying that the flight had been delayed until 9.15, this is unnacceptable as this was a 9 hour wait and we had different things booked in Las Vegas for my family to attend.

united-airlines;2015-07-22;"On Sunday, June 14th, my family and a close friend took a flight from Newark Airport which should have connected in Toronto to a flight to Dublin, Ireland. Unfortunately, because the Captain of the flight did not turn up for his passengers, the flight was delayed for approximately 3 hours. (United Airlines staff in Newark informed us that this was the reason why we were delayed.) This was not a weather-related incident. In any event, this delay caused us (and others, I believe) to miss the connection in Toronto. We were not rebooked to another flight. Instead I was told that all of United's flights that night and following day were ""oversold"". I asked if we could fly home and was told that that would take days as well. The customer service rep in Toronto was particularly nasty and actually slowed down the entire process by training a new employee while talking to us. It should be noted, that I was traveling with my 5 year old daughter who had not eaten for many hours and the slow processing and communications by this rep meant that nearly all of the shops and restaurants in the airport had closed down for the night. I asked if we could be put on another airline and was told that this was 'not allowed'. I also asked if we could get a flight somewhere near Dublin and was only offered a flight to Turkey or Frankfurt the next night. The rep did not offer hotel vouchers or food vouchers or any practical resolution, but only intentionally took her time scanning flights. The employee finally got us a flight to London the next night and rooms in the adjacent hotel. If we had not fought for hours, late at night, we would have been left to sleep in the chairs of the airport with my 5 year old daughter. While I am grateful that we finally were able to get on another flight - to London, then Dublin through British Airways - we missed 2 days of our trip. Coming home we had another ordeal with United. The return flight which was changed to a departure in Dublin to Washington D.C. and then, on to LaGuardia was actually worse. While turbulence cannot be helped, one of the flight attendants hit her head. This meant that paramedics had to care for the attendant first, which delayed our flight and caused us to miss our flight home. I had to rent a car to get home. I will never fly United again.";NEGATIVE

However, it does state on the website, in-flight services, Business/Business First, Meals and beverages: Pre-departure beverage service Complimentary beverages, including beer, wine, spirits, soft drinks and freshly brewed coffee Meal service on flights longer than two hour - my flight was nearly 3 hours.

united-airlines;2015-07-20;"My entire experience with United this weekend was a total disaster. To begin, my flight from Denver to Bend on Friday night was cancelled last minute due to no availability of pilots. They actually scanned our boarding passes in and had us lined up ready to get on the plane just to have us turn around and go back inside to later find out our flight would be cancelled. We then had to fly to Eugene instead, rent a car, and drive 2.5 hours to get to our destination (Bend). Then, I was told my bag would arrive at our place of stay the next morning. I did not receive my bag until 7pm on the 17th. Then, as if this wasn't enough to deal with on our way there, my flights coming home were a disaster as well. We had to return our rental car to Redmond rather than Eugene as that's where our flight was leaving on Sunday. Then, the flight from Redmond to Denver was ""overweight"" due to temperatures in the area. We had to wait until 5 people volunteered to change flights before our flight could leave. I get to Denver only to find out my flight from Denver to SLC was delayed. Not to mention, I already had a 3 hour layover and this delay made it 4+ hours. The flight continued to get delayed and didn't end up leaving Denver until about 1am. I did not get home until 3am. I am completely upset with my entire United experience and will not be flying United again. The customer service was awful.

united-airlines;2015-07-13;UA is raking in the profits but that was certainly not noticeable on this old A320 service from New York to Denver. The plane is old. The First Class seats are tired.

On a positive note - I do have to say that my meal was quite good.;POSITIVE

Our little one got sick on the flight and there were no bags, it looked like the plane had not even been properly cleaned before our delayed flight. I would also think that after having people waiting such a long period of time that they would offer something other than a beverage on the plane, they didn't even seem to have coffee for the travelers when the flight finally left.

When I boarded there was at least 5 lockers that were empty, more than enough space to fit my tiny carry-on bag. After we boarded the captain announced that we would have to wait another 30/40 mins. When we reached Chicago Airport they couldn't give us a gate so we waited in the aircraft for another 30/45 mins. I got a message on my phone that my connecting flight had already departed and re- booked me on a 2.15 pm flight the next day. When I finally got to talk to a customer representative I told her my situation and that I had to get to Detroit, she was kind enough to book me on an American Airlines flight.

When I asked a blue shirt baggage attendant, she said it was most likely because I didn't have funds. Very uncalled for. 50+ people felt the same way. As the lines became longer they started to manually check in bags at ""Additional Services"". The staff were very engaging with only themselves. United waved their baggage fee, because all of our flights were delayed due this unfortunate event. Apparently this also happened 6 weeks ago. When we arrived to Punta Cana, our bags never arrived. When I contacted customer service, they said they had no idea where our bags were. Will not be using their services again.";NEGATIVE

While waiting at Newark Liberty for my next flight to Chicago, I was notified two hours before take off that my plane would be delayed and I would miss my final flight to Appleton. I was quickly placed on stand-by for another flight to Chicago, but soon realized I would not be able to get on that flight, as others were trying to fly stand-by as well. I had to take my original flight, which was delayed three hours, due to the fact that the aircraft was coming from Dallas and was delayed due to storms. I missed my original flight to Appleton, so was booked on a later one. In all, I spent about 15 hours on planes and in airports. It was a long day, but except for one customer service representative at Newark, who acted as if I was an inconvenience, every other United employee I dealt with was kind and helpful. ";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2015-07-08;"Flight at 5.21pm was cancelled due to scheduled maintenance, which I understand. What I don't understand is why there wouldn't be another aircraft in use if they knew there was a flight scheduled. Then departure was scheduled for another flight 3 hours later at 9.00pm. Three hours later arrived, but still no sign of an aircraft. Now, the reason for an additional 2 hour and 5 minute delay was ""a late inbound aircraft coming from OH"". They can't figure out what is going on, maintenance or a late inbound aircraft? The original departure at 5:21pm turned into a departure of 11.00pm. I call customer service and the rep was rude, didn't let me finish talking before she cut me off and didn't listen to my questions. I forgot that I disliked flying with United. I last flew w/them 7 years ago and was so upset at the lack of organization, delayed flights, small and uncomfortable seats and poor service by the staff. I vow to never fly with United ever again!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-07;"I arrived at the airport too early and had to wait to check in. This was my fault. The lounge was great and I was able to have a nice breakfast. The flight attendants were fine, the seat was comfortable and the lunch, I had the beef, was excellent. I woke up after a quick nap and the fasten seatbelt sign was on and stayed on for the last six hours of the flight. The arrival snack was rather disappointing, a piece of bread with tomato sauce and some fruit. Thirty minutes before landing, the pilot finally came on and said, the fasten seatbelt sign is on and prepare for landing. ";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-07-06;"I have a huge problem with United overbooking flights. We arrived at the Durango airport 1 hour before our flight and were told the flight was overbooked and we could not board. There were available seats, but they were upgrades so we would have to pay the additional cost. That doesn't make sense to me. United sells more economy tickets than there are economy seats on the plane and then expects me to either pay more money to fly or spend the night, at my expense, in Durango. They should have just given us the seats. My son was on a flight leaving Durango after ours for Denver and because of delays missed his connecting flight for Oklahoma. After waiting in a line where passengers were receiving hotel vouchers, he was told in a very matter of fact tone that he did not qualify for a voucher. He eventually got his voucher but he did not need to go through what he went through to get it.";NEGATIVE

Its comfort is at the limit of acceptance level, all they provide is a foldable tray which does not even have a glass holder. There is the latest in-flight entertainment system which comes actually with a very small screen. It hung 3 times while watching movies. One more time, it is relatively new but not comparable with modern systems. The service on board (if it can be called service) was the worst service I have had in the last 10 years. The crew were not polite, and didn't ask once anything like ""Can I offer you something to drink?"" instead they look at you without saying anything, until you say what you want. If you are not fast enough they are gone. IAH-GDL was on Embraer RJ145 I wonder how they can operate this route with such small airplane when GDL airport is able to handle bigger airplanes. You can't even stand up on this plane. Overall, my review is totally negative. It is like going back 30 years. Never again.";NEGATIVE

The aircraft was delayed by 3 hours in Newark because of ""the inbound aircraft not being available"" and when the aircraft finally did arrive, it developed a ""computer fault"" that further delayed departure by another hour.

We were then told that the next flight out wasn't until 9.40 the next morning leaving us stranded in Washington overnight.

united-airlines;2015-07-01;"Flew out of HNL to SFO on a tired Boeing 777-200 with no seatback videos. The boarding is similar to Southwest as you line up in group numbers. The problem is that we paid for an economy plus seat and still had to wait at the end to board. The flight crew was average but what upset me was that a poor woman with limited English asked the flight attendant for some water so she could take medication before take off. She was pointing at what she needed in the galley and the flight attendant screamed at her and threatened her with disembarkation. For a five hour Pacific crossing all we got was one drink service and food purchase which is unacceptable. After a four hour stopover we boarded again with the same procedure. Once we got on our way the flight attendants provided their usual sub standard service. However, as this was a single aisle aircraft some passengers needed to go the bathroom and with drink service going on the access to the bathroom was restricted. The flight attendants in first class made sure that the economy passengers stayed in their section.  All I can say is that flying domestically is more or less not worth it. Luckily, majority of my trip including two flights on Air New Zealand who treated their passengers with respect and were not afraid to offer complimentary food and drinks. It is sad that Continental Airlines got eaten up by United. As long as I can remember the service on United has been average and the nickname untidy is well earned.";NEGATIVE

The newly upgraded international service included boxed wine (horrible) and an appetizer to enjoy with your beverage. However, the appetizer was a cracker and a piece of cheese and that was served with the dessert. No IFE except for fixed cabin screens, but they pride themselves in offering you free wifi to watch United Airlines inflight entertainment.

The lady helping me, who was trying very hard to try and lower the price, ended up knocking it down to about $300 US. Part of this issue was that they charged me for oversize and overweight for my ski bag. Most airlines charge a base $100 and the weight doesn't matter unless it's over the 70lbs max weight. Another lady working had rudely told me that I was not allowed to have three pairs of skis in my bag, even though there was nothing I could do about it. She ""let it slide"" and charged me instead.

WiFi entertainment system that streams TV and movies over tablets worked well, and provided lots of options. No problem finding my flights. The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier.  The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline. Using the smaller, regional airports like Harrisburg saves a lot of airport headaches - that's what gives United the leg up over other carriers for me.";POSITIVE

I found  rudeness characterizes how UA treats its customers. For example, it was clearly printed on my e-ticket that prepared meals would be provided, but what they do not say is that you first have to ask about the meal (flight staff never mentioned that food was even available), and then you are told to look at the menu if you want to purchase any food. The same goes for WiFi which they claimed was available, but did not work even on a flight within the mainland US. As for entertainment, I am sure that you could have a great selection, but they charge you for watching everything and anything, including TV programmes. Inflight staff were rude beyond belief. Aside from behaving as though they were doing you a favour by even noticing that you were on the flight, several of the staff would openly talk about and complain about passengers within hearing distance of the passengers themselves.

The two legs to HKG and ORD were fine, in fact, I arrived a hour ahead of schedule in ORD, giving me a comfortable 3 hours transit. The incoming aircraft for my connection ORD-DTW came in a hour late, and by then we were caught in the storm and flights were grounded. We boarded the aircraft twice, and were told to deplane. Eventually the flight was cancelled. A 3:50pm flight to get me from ORD to DTW, I was still in ORD at 930pm. I can't get my checked bag as there is no procedure for that, and it will be on the next flight out to my final destination. We were given discounted hotel coupons, and I was rebooked on a 4:07pm flight the following day. As it was only 4 hours by bus from Chicago to Detroit, I decided to take mega-bus rather than to fly, and thank goodness I did that, because the rebooked flight on the next day was again cancelled due to air control issues! My bag actually arrived at Detroit earlier than I did, and I had to make a trip to the Detroit airport to get it. My woes didn't end. 10 days later, I was going to get back to Singapore from Reagan (DCA-ORD-HKG-SIN). At Reagan, I couldn't check-in, because my entire itinerary was cancelled. I didn't get a reason for the cancellation, and got rebooked on the same itinerary. Alright never mind that I have middle seat for all 20 hours flight. At ORD, I tried to see if there are other seats available at the gate, and the staff was very rude, and unhelpful. ""There are only middle seats available, what do you expect me to do?"". She did not even try to look at my tickets. If she had, she would have seen that I got rebooked on economy plus, and telling me that would have made me feel better about the 15 hours flight. Onboard the plane, I was lucky, and only the aisle seat on the row behind me was occupied, and I was able to have a restful flight on a window seat. Why was the staff at the gate not willing to even look at my ticket? She didn't even look at her screen to check. ";NEGATIVE

I'm fairly certain there was a charge for the entertainment, plus a charge for the necessary wifi connection. The premium economy was okay. It did have extra legroom and more recline (my big issue) than regular economy seats, but the width was barely adequate. And the aisles seem to have gotten narrower since I last flew on a plane.

Since it was almost midnight, there was only 1 customer service representative for almost 300 passengers. Called their call center and was given last seat on the last flight departing LAX this night. It was economy middle seat in the rear part of the aircraft. Missed my connection to CMH in ORD. Customers service in ORD is awful. Representatives are not competent and are arrogant.

When insisted (I am a Gold Premier) they found me seat on American flight but told me that I need to pay 374$ for this 50 min flight. I refused, and asked them to put me on the next available flight which was departing 12 h later. They refused to give me a hotel voucher or meal voucher. I went to customer service in the terminal 3 and they gave seat on flight that was scheduled to depart 8 h later but put me on the waiting list.

united-airlines;2015-06-20;"As a loyal United Airlines customer, with Global Service status for years, that following experience has helped me realize United neither values my business nor cares about my experience with their company. On May 29th my direct flight from Dulles to Kuwait was diverted to Istanbul. The pilots timed out and passengers were stranded for over 12 hours in Istanbul- with no Turkish visas nor United staff to re-book and assist with hotels (United has no service in Istanbul, agents were eventually flown in from the Middle East). Indeed diversions are neither planned nor pleasant. however, passengers anticipated United would have had a contingency protocol in place for such events. After being left to fend for ourselves, and spending hours on the phone (international roaming) with customer care, passengers finally reached Kuwait the following day to ultimately learn that the remainder our respective original itinerary were canceled meaning onward travel and return flights to the US had to be re-booked. Shockingly, United did not apologize for the inconvenience and (as of today- eg. 23 days later) has not offered to reimburse visa-on-arrival fees in Turkey nor the international roaming fees passengers encountered while trying on the phone with United’s “Customer Care” team. Furthermore, all passengers paid for the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, boarded the flight from Dulles to Kuwait, and apparently since United diverted to Istanbul, zero miles for the Dulles to Kuwait leg will be applied to passengers’ account as credit toward their annual status - seems unfair if United accepted the payment for the flight and we all boarded the flight. After over a dozen conversations with “Customer Care” leading all the way up to the Senior Manager for Global Services, I am deeply disappointed to say the agreed upon follow-up that was supposed to occur 5 days ago has not. The Senior Manager did have one of his subordinates send an e-mail stating they will be in contact as soon as they reach a conclusion to my request. Wouldn’t it have been nice to receive a message stating “Thank you again for continued business and patience, we value your business and as a customer and respectfully offer our apologies for the inconvenience, reimbursement for the incurred expenses, and credit of the earned miles” ?

united-airlines;2015-06-19;"Domestic First Class/International Business Class, ORD-EWR-MXP. Purposely booked a 2 hour connection at EWR given United's timeliness issues as of late. United changed the flights shortening the connection to 1hr 20. Called and had changed to a 3:25 hour connection. Stated I did not trust United with the shorter connection despite it being legal when challenged and the agent made the change without further comment. The outbound flight was late due to weather. Unfortunately all other EWR flights were showing on time as was the departure to MXP. Little communication from gate staff in Chicago. Arrived over 3 hours late in EWR with departure to MXP showing on time. After a sprint to the connecting gate, the MXP departure pushed back multiple times and we finally boarded about an hour an a half late. Typical ‘old United’ flat bed which I like better than the Continental flat bed as it seems to have more leg room. Pillows and blankets have been upgraded. Ordered my meal on a tray in one go so I could sleep and all but dessert was delivered when everyone else was getting their first course. Food was decent, much better than old United. IFE is sparse with less content than a few years ago but I have gotten in the habit of bringing my own and the power at the seat kept everything charged. Cabin staff basically disappeared once the meal was served – no one coming through or replenishing water. They appeared about 1:30 before landing for the breakfast service. We arrived about an hour late but the bags were delivered in a fairly timely manner and all of the bags arrived. My return was cancelled and I ended up on Lufthansa all of the way back. Much better, especially seat comfort and reliability, except for the food which I always find a bit odd on LH. Frankly, I am starting to pick other airlines when I am in business class and I have the choice. In my opinion, United has become very undependable, both from a timeliness and baggage delivery standpoint, since the merger. Much of the US hub counter staff is now outsourced and they are of little help when something goes wrong. The hard product and service is average to slightly below average. Economy Plus on UA is still great value but I am starting to avoid United when flying on an expensive ticket or an itinerary requiring connections.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-06-19;"Previously we flew United to the US in August 2015 - Sydney to SFO, SFO to LAX, then LVG to Sydney via SFO. No problems, no delays, no cancellations. This past May we flew again to the US with United. I have to admit that this time I was concerned as I had read many bad reviews about the airline. We had also requested upgrades on all flights to Business First and had been approved on our outward and return flights. Then my fears were realised when one hour after checking in online for our flight to SFO I received an email informing me the flight had been cancelled due to the inability to find a crew to fly the plane from SFO to Sydney. After a frantic call to United we were put on the LAX flight which left 2 hours earlier the next day. Of course we lost our upgrade but the customer service rep was good enough to put us in Economy Plus at no charge. Again my fears came back when we were at the airport to be informed that the flight was delayed due to the inbound flight being delayed at LAX. However that said the pilot was able to make up time in the air and we actually landed early in LAX and easily made our connecting flight to New York. This was the only problem we encountered with United on this trip.";POSITIVE

Passengers are partially to blame, but the airlines are mainly to blame - Baggage fees, paying for meals and drinks, paying for more leg room ""economy plus"". Planes are dirty! Also, United has changed its Frequent Flyer Program and is no longer #1 in my opinion! Loyalty is no longer rewarded. It is all how much you spend for a flight!";NEGATIVE

Not the best time to be delayed by a full hour and have to rush to the next flight just to make it before doors were closed. They excused themselves saying it was the weather. But here it is 3 weeks later flying home and not only was my first flight delayed but so was my second flight. There was no room for all the luggage and people had to put 5hem under the plane. While I am delayed my spouse is driving 3 hours to wait an hour. I had to feed my children in the airport expensive cheap food. Never again will I fly United.

It took LH staff over 30 minutes to resolve, but in the end, I am sitting comfortably onboard. Boarding was efficient and smooth, and my seat (exit row 28L) is perfect. We pushed back 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The cabin crew have been particularly attentive, efficient, and friendly. Beverage and meal service were quick. My only complaint is with the new economy drink and meal service. Although the inflight menu continues to list sparkling wine as available for purchase, the reality is that in economy, champagne is not to be had for love nor money. This is a discrepancy that should be resolved, either by changing the information in the inflight magazine, or preferably, by restoring this purchase option.

The airline reps were telling us that there is no space to put any carry on baggage. We begged them to allow at least 1 small carry on baggage instead of 4 carry on bags as we are international passengers and they refused it. They were so rude. They even threaten to call police, if we don't follow their instruction to check in the carry on bags. They were even forcing us to reschedule our international travel to with our carry on baggage. Finally, we did our international travel without any carry on baggage.

On the way there, at DCA, there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport, boarded, and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm, arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us, and to us.

Since the plane had obviously not been cleaned upon arrival from the previous flight we were instructed to leave the plane with all of our personal belongings and wait in the tunnel that leads from the terminal to the plane for a security inspection.  After the cleaning was done we were instructed to board again to wait for a pilot to arrive. When the pilots did arrive they decided the plane needed refuelling so again we should wait a while for that to happen. The flight finally took off at around 8.00 at night.

As much as I've ripped on United for flights to and from Japan (especially compared to their codeshare partner, ANA), the new system is a definite improvement. Beer and wine are once again complimentary (finally!), and the meal is doled out in three smaller ""courses"" instead of being dumped on your tiny tray table in one go. The food itself (cheese ravioli) wasn't bad at all, again much improved from my last trans-Pacific last year. It's a US airline, so you still have to deal with the occasional long-tenured yet disgruntled flight attendant, but overall I didn't hate the experience, which is saying a lot for a 12 hour flight in Economy on any airline. This review sounds kind of mediocre, but the thing is, the flight was also very cheap. With that in mind, the cost performance was impressive.";POSITIVE

On the bright side, she gave us a priority tag for our baggage. The problem didn't stop there. Even our in-flight experience was hell. The food was far from edible. It was my first time to encounter a long-haul flight where you have to purchase snacks for a minimum of $8.99. There were no individual screens for entertainment and the wifi wasn't working properly.

The cabin crew were very underwhelming and not accommodating passenger requests, to the point where you were not allowed a second cup of coffee because they had cleaned up and put everything away. The inflight entertainment cut out for our side of the plane and crew were not interested in doing anything about it. After 4 resetting attempts, the screens worked again. This being our second flight in 7 days we were expecting a little more enthusiasm and pride in their work from crew members. Being seated in economy class and not up the front meant that by the time our meals were served they had run out of popular items and we were left without a choice. No apology from crew, we were met with there's none left and this is what you can have. No attempt to salvage the situation at all and since this was a 14 hour flight, it was a long time without food. Of course, we were welcome to purchase an assortment of onboard snacks at very inflated prices. We will not be travelling with United again as this has not been a pleasant experience at all.

From the beginning there was a noticeable lack of service at the airport a very casual approach to almost being a big yawn. We boarded a very crowded old Boeing 757 it was scruffy dirty and the flight crew even scruffier. We had paid for Economy Plus and a bulkhead all added extra's happy to pay when the service is provided in this case the seats were so narrow it was hideous the galley to our right was occupied most of time by a flight attendant who was more interested in himself than anything else the rest of the crew appeared very uninterested even the First Class crew could not smile. The continual line for the restrooms required us to keep moving our legs never again. We were showered in ice cubes from the galley twice I ordered a cocktail to help keep me calm $14 AUD for a drink such a rip off it was basically thrown at me. What has happened to United? We vowed never to fly with them again now here comes the kicker we had a return from LAX-HNL in late May a 777-200 lovely aircraft two roomy seats on the side in Economy Plus and some of the most charming flight crew I have met.

united-airlines;2015-06-04;"I was travelling from Orlando to Anchorage with a connection in Houston and San Francisco. When we arrived at the airport our flight had already been delayed by an hour and half meaning that we would miss our Houston connection. I went immediately to the service counter to have it sorted out and they had already switched us to a Delta flight transferred our bags and arranged meal vouchers for us. I was surprised at this high level of service. All in all we arrived in Anchorage on our Delta flight only 10 minutes after we would have arrived on our originally booked flight. Our travel experience back to Orlando was a completely different matter however. After arriving at Anchorage airport and checking in I realized that I had been bumped from my originally booked aisle seat to a middle seat in the same row. After boarding I realized that the seat that I had originally booked remained open so I simply picked up my stuff and moved to the seat I had originally purchased. This was simply an annoyance and source of confusion rather than a true inconvenience. The flight itself was rather uneventful. We made it to San Francisco made our connection and waited to depart. And we waited. And waited. And waited. Initially we were told that we were waiting for some baggage from a connecting flight they presumably boarded the baggage and we began taxiing. After taxiing for a few minutes the captain came over the speaker and informed us that we had to return to the gate due to a ""water leak"". We then sat in the plane for 2.5 hours while multiple maintenance men stomped on and off the plane trying to locate the source of the leak. After sitting on the (hot) plane for about two hours I had already finished the bottle of water that I had brought on board. When I asked one of the flight attendants if I could get some water she told me that I couldn't have any water because the maintenance man was standing in front of the bottle. Is that the one and only bottle of water that United stocked on this particular flight? I wandered back to my seat and endured the additional thirty minutes of idle waiting. Finally the pilot came back over the speakers and informed us that the ""water leak"" was actually condensation from the coffee maker that the flight attendants failed to wipe up after the last use. Needless to say this made for some pretty incredulous passengers.";NEGATIVE

Even though their airfares are low only take this airline if you enjoy spending your vacation time in airports or dealing with surly staff who seem to delight in making customers' lives hell.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-06-01;"This was my first time to fly Domestic First Class on United Airlines. My first thoughts were how the cabin service reminded me of what economy class once was when I flew as a teenager in the late 1970's. This trip was from SEA to ORD to IND and back. Zone 1 boarding: Great! Initial cabin greeting was pleasant and prompt. Seat comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drink and snack service: very good. Flight Attendants: If I ran my own airline I would hire each attendant that I encountered on this trip. Meal service was good no complaints. Inflight entertainment: On the outbound trip there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch no charge on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the return part of my trip the equipment was Inop. This is the second US carrier that I've encountered with Inop inflight equipment. United you need to spend more time making sure your equipment works. ""Just Good Enough"" is not good enough!";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-06-01;Flight to St Louis from Houston cancelled at night due to 'rain' so I had to get a room at my own expense as did hundreds of others finding a hotel took over an hour. Before leaving the Houston airport to my room I booked tickets to get me to St Louis the next day. Here is where United incompetence took over. Ticket was Houston to Tulsa Tulsa to St. Louis. When I got to Tulsa I ask why the flight from Tulsa to St Louis would take over 4 hours answer: you are going through Chicago but you won't have to leave the plane! Got to Chicago told that plane was not going to St. Louis went to desk asking where was my flight to St Louis flight and when answer: the St Louis flight just left I can put you on standby on the next flight! Got to gate and asked for standby update told here would be one standby seat available as one passenger was not going to make the departure time I was not to worry about getting on the standby position was mine. When it came time for stand by to board another person's name was called. Went back to the desk asking why I was not the standby person answer: she has more status! Then when names were announced who had seats but had not boarded my name was called. Went back to desk asking if I had a seat answer: oh is that you? Yes you have a seat! If I ever fly United again it will be out of desperation not by choice.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-31;Terrible service provided by the flight attendant. Unfortunately I had fallen asleep when the drinks were being served and when I asked the flight attendant for water she just kept on walking. I pushed the call button and as she was serving the water she sarcastically asked whether there was an emergency to which I responded that I felt almost dehydrated and her unbelievably rude answer was that I could have got up to get the water myself. It's bad enough that the airline doesn't serve any food at no charge anymore but to top it off their in-flight service has got much worse. I didn't pay $60 for this international flight it was much more!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-31;"My wife and I took United for our honeymoon to Hawaii. United fails to inform you that you need to download their app in advance to enjoy any sort of entertainment inflight. You could pay $10+ an hour to use their wifi but to use any other of their ""free"" service you must download the app in advance. For those who do not or do not have a compatible device bring your own entertainment. Upon calling to check in on our return we learned the flight had been cancelled. While they had my email address on file the only notification came through a text message. However this text didn't inform us of anything but merely asked us to ""text yes"" to the text to receive subsequent messages. Assuming this was just another airline phishing attempt I ignored the message. While they knew I was not aware of the change no call attempt or email attempt was made. Overall I satisfied.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-28;I arrived at the check-in counter 40+ minutes to departure. The attendant called the gate to see if the flight was delayed but they said it wasn't. I received this notification immediately after. United flight UA1246 on April 26 is delayed due to a late inbound aircraft arrival. Now departs: 2.00 pm). Hence I cannot check in my luggage. No worries I will throw all my liquids away and carry it on. Ultimately I gate checked one bag. Once the entire flight was boarded the pilot immediately stated we were going to be delayed and probably shouldn't have boarded the flight. We land 15-20 minutes late and we sit on the tarmac for another 10 minutes because our gate is taken. This is a common occurrence flying into IAH. The straw that broke the camel's back - zero communication and no empathy for every passenger that checked luggage. After everything else we had to wait about an hour to get our luggage. 4 planes on one belt and we were the 4th in line while only half of the belts were occupied.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-27;Our flight from Las Vegas to Charleston South Carolina took 28 hours. The first plane from Vegas to Houston was delayed because of mechanical problems. The connecting flight was delayed because of a pilot timing out. We paid for two hotels because one was prepaid in Charleston and we needed to sleep before our morning flight to Charleston. The morning flight was changed because of a tire problem and again because of communications problems. We were offered 2500 points or $50 toward our next a United flight.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-22;I had booked a trip to Hong Kong through Flight Network. on the way there (14 hour flight) the plane did not have any entertainment units or even a plug in for a laptop. On our way back we were to go from Hong Kong to San Francisco and then from San Francisco to Edmonton. United Airlines had switched the connecting flight to go through Chicago instead of San Francisco which I only found out when checking in on our departure day. The attendant at the United desk was unable to provide an explanation as to why the connection was switched and was basically of no help. This ended up amounting to a 9 hour delay and me missing a day at work.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-22;Recently flew from West Palm Beach to Austin VIA Houston. The flight from Houston to Austin was on a brand new regional jet with nine first class seats. Unfortunately several sensors were showing and everyone needed to exit the plane. Within 30 minutes another new regional plane with the same configuration was waiting a few gates away and the plane was only 45 minutes late getting into Austin. Good job United. Unfortunately returning was a different story. I arrived at the Austin airport several hours early and inquired about an earlier flight to Houston. I was told that there had been no late flights all day. The plane arrived in Austin late and by the time I boarded it was 30 minutes late. Then it began raining in Houston so the plane had to wait another 20 minutes in Austin. By the time the plane arrived in Houston my flight to West Palm Beach had left and it was the last flight of the day. Most passengers on the full A319 flying east had to find a hotel for the night at their own expense because United is not responsible for weather related delays and it is usually raining somewhere where United flies. The next afternoon I was on an old regional plane with no first class seats to West Palm Beach.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-20;Just returned from a round trip from London to Washington then New York San Francisco and finally Cancun and return. We experienced no problems at all. All flights on time good seat width and legroom food good and friendly staff. On some of the flights there was no inflight entertainment but it wasn't really a problem.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-20;UA 1001 IAH-FLL March 13 2015. UA 54 Newark-Paris April 11 2015. UA 55 Paris-Newark April 18 2015. After United bought Continental everything went downhill. Flights were delayed or cancelled they routinely have mechanical problems with their planes their flight crews have gotten worse and worse to the point that they often are just plain abusive their overseas business class is terrible and their ground crews are incompetent dishonest and often nasty. Unfortunately they have so many direct routes that you are stuck either flying United or taking another airline with a stop midway through your flight. If you have frequent flier miles with them good luck. You can almost never use your miles when you want to travel over the holidays or they charge some exorbitant number of miles. And now your miles will expire if you don't continue to fly with these people. United Airlines is a nightmare.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-20;My husband and I travelled from Newark NJ to Dubai with a stop over at Washington-Dulles. Newark flight was delayed and our Washington Dulles connection was missed. It took from 10 pm to 12.30 am to get to a customer service agent at Washington-Dulles where we stood in line for two and a half hours. Agents took an average of 15 to 20 minutes per customer.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-16;UA 895 4/11/15 UA 99 5/2/15. In my job I average 175k miles of travel a year primarily with UA and their Star Alliance partners. As a 1K I enjoy personalized attention with UA such as automatic rebooking on cancelled flights or missed connections. I fly coach but with my status I frequently get upgrades domestically. Although I'm qualified for 6 global upgades a year that hasn't happened since 2010 when both my wife and SIL received Business Class seats MUC-ORD (prior to the merger with Continental). Unfortunate but could be a sign of the health of the economy that those seats are being purchased. At any rate I am very happy with the service I get from UA and even though I live near ORD I have had very few cancellations or delays of significance flying in or out of Chicago. Prices are competitive and schedules are great making it very easy to co-ordinate travel to Asia or Europe. While I fly Delta and SkyTeam partners occasionally I will fly UA and partners if at all possible. Most recent travel was 747-400 ORD-HKG outbound to Taiwan and MEL-LAX (787-9) and LAX-ORD (757) homebound.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-16;United improbably informed us two days in advance that our flight from Albuquerque to Denver connecting to Minneapolis would most likely be delayed? Good to their word they got us to Denver an hour and a half late missing our connection maintenance issues was the reason. We had managed to rebook our connection in Albuquerque the agent assuring us our luggage would remain in Denver. Now it's 10pm no luggage and waiting in line with approximately 400 people to get to one service desk. 2 Hours later we have a hotel voucher and nothing else talked to some low level manager who couldn't understand why 2 full fare first class customers were upset after all we got a free hotel room.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-13;We recently flew the Dreamliner from Melbourne to LA with 3 of our sons. We have flown United before on the old 747's. the Dreamliner is just beautiful great inflight entertainment larger windows which you can control making it darker with the touch of a button very friendly and happy staff always makes the 14 hour flight a lot more pleasant. The food was really good and the beverages were a good selection not too sure about paying for a beer when most other international airlines include that in the fare. Overall very happy to fly United for our family holiday's to America no delays whatsoever which is always great look forward to the next plane trip with United.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-13;Flew from New Orleans to Frankfurt Germany with a layover in Newark. Plane was an older 767-300. Plane was delayed Food was cold and terrible flight attendants were not friendly at all. On the way back I flew Lufthansa and what a difference! It was a great flying experience! I've always flied United but from now on I will make sure I get a Lufthansa flight when traveling to Germany!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-12;"I had the worst experience on United Airlines today. I was told I couldn't board the plane with my 4 month old infant because of weight restrictions on the plane. 6 people were told they couldn't board the plane including myself and I found out that was based on our fares. I was penalized because I planned ahead and booked my ticket for less money. It doesn't matter that I started my trip hours earlier or that I connected and arrived to the gate on time. Some kind soul did try to volunteer their seat. I overhead the gate crew saying there was a mother and baby who should board next which was superseded by the supervisor who said full fares trump everything. I left my house at 4.45am to catch a flight to connect to Chicago so I could get to my destination in the shortest time possible with a sleeping baby. I am a frequent flier a ""MileagePlus Explorer"" (which I pay for by having a premium credit card) yet here I am - the only person with a child on my plane-prevented from boarding because my $554 fare wasn't enough to get me my reserved seat. I am one irate customer and one irate mother - and I have to wait 7 hours with my baby for the next flight.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-11;United Airlines is the worst airline I have flown with. After waiting an hour in line to check in I get to the counter and find out it was two late to board my flight. This was after getting up at 3 am in the morning just be sure I was there ahead of time. There is no excuse for their incompetence. They spent my valuable time chatting with one another amongst themselves at the counter and not warning anyone in line that there was a danger missing there flight or even showing effort to work faster. They did not attempt to even try make amends. Do not fly United out of Rochester NY they are the most unprofessional workers I have seen in this industry.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-11;Recent flight from Hawaii to LA 6 hours. Beverage offered when first boarded no other beverage or food offered through out the entire flight. Disgusted as over night flight and not even breakfast or tea or coffee. Stewards not particularly helpful or sociable. No audio or visual entertainment provided. No pillows onboard.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-11;Five of us flew from Palm Springs CA to Philadelphia PA. Our flight was cancelled due to weather in our connecting city so we had to stay over an extra day but United was helpful and upgraded us to premium economy. We had a great flight friendly flight attendants and got a great deal on ticket prices. I would recommend United Airlines.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-11;UA 937 I had not flown in a 767 in a long time and I travel a lot. The plane was old and dirty and the flight attendants were old and fat. They never smiled or greeted you - clearly hate their jobs. The announcements were like the ones you hear in school. Don't do this don't do that - militant. I had booked a Swiss flight I thought. The inflight entertainment and food were very poor compared to other airlines. No water bottles given out just cups. Cheap. The toilets were smelly and there was no amenity kit you see in other airlines. United complains about the open skies but they could never compete with Emirates or Qatar with such old planes and unattractive staff.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-08;I have grown to despise flying after an early love affair with travel in the early 80's. That said the flight I was on from Dublin IR to IAD on a United 757 was excellent. We were in premium economy which made a huge difference on a 7+ hour flight. We had two hot meals (full + snack) three full beverage services and at least 3 or 4 juice/water services. I was dreading a narrow body long haul flight but United did it right. A most pleasant surprise in this age of travel misery.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-06;"I booked our family of (3's) flight months in advance all seats were requested together and I prefer sitting next to the window because it seems to help my severe motion sickness. Per experience I usually allow a 90-120 min layover if I have a connecting flight which if you fly out of Pittsburgh it is almost impossible to get straight through flights unless you fly Southwest where unless you are a bouncer you cannot get a window seat to save your life. The flight from Pittsburgh to Chicago was on 'mechanical delay'. The 'mechanical delay' was about 90 mins which meant we would not make our next flight out of Chicago to our scheduled event that evening. However when we landed at O'Hare we were unaware that several flights were being held because of our delay. I asked a United staff member at our departing gate about our flight and he said ""it's departing in 3 minutes you will not have time to make the flight"". I went immediately to the Customer Service desk where many of my fellow passengers were congregating. While standing there my party heard our names over the loud speaker to board our flight. One party is physically disabled. Unfortunately we did not make the flight and we missed the first half of the event that evening. United should have contacted the gate to let them know we were on our way should have made arrangements for a cart for the disabled passenger in order to get us there in a timely manner. This one simple communication act would have taken less than 1 minute.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-04;SFO-IAH return. Both flights delayed for a variety of reasons. Air travel in the US is becoming such a hassle with rude and paranoid TSA lesser flights packed planes and crowded skies. Ground and air staff friendly and helpful. Free DirecTV as a result of the delays on both legs. I'd avoid flying if there was an alternative mode (perhaps the US should invest in a bullet train?). So frustrating.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-04;While traveling to Christchurch N.Z from Richland WA. on Flight 833 April 23rd we learned there were gale force winds and rain of up to 55 miles an hour around Sydney Australia. We were forced to travel on to Melbourne where we waited on the tarmac for 2 hours until we knew whether we could disembark. It turned out that we did all go into the airport and then were given lunch vouchers. We waited 3-4 hours and then got back on our plane bound for Sydney. I checked to see if I could catch a flight from Melbourne to Christchurch but was told by a UA attendant that there were no more flights to Christchurch from Melbourne I was given a motel voucher for a night's stay and continued on to Christchurtch via NZ Airlines the next day. All in all everything was handled well flight attendants gave extra cookies we were updated frequently about what was to transpire and I think all the passengers were happy that our safety was the most important thing to the crew.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-02;Ditching United and my mileage credit card after this next flight finally departs. Pittsburgh to Newark in United flown by Republic. Last weeks 'maintenance' delay of 45mins should have been enough of a red flag along with overhearing the air stewardess complaining to senior ground staff that did they really have to fly in such an old plane. Tonight sitting with another 'maintenance' delay of 2.5hrs+ on last flight of a Friday night to get home to family - would have been quicker for me to drive the 5.5hrs door to door. A leaving customer.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;MCO-IAD Flight 1731. IAD-MCO Flight 1133. They are always delayed on flights then they ask customers if they are checking in any bags. They charge $25 if you say yes however if you take your luggage on the flight then they tell customers that it's free. This has delayed our flight several times and it's completely a rip-off! Not to mention that they changed our seats last min without notifying us until last min.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;SAN-ORD-BRU AMS-IAH-SAN in economy plus. Flights on time service friendly and professional food decent IFE good planes clean and in good order and baggage arrived with me. United even e-mailed to inform me of a 24 hour transportation strike upon my arrival in Brussels with an offer to change my trip with no fee. Nice but wasn't necessary. No complaints.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;We had a large group flying from all over the United States to Cancun for my daughters wedding. Every single person flying United had issues! My son's flight was cancelled due to no pilot. United then put him his wife and 4 yr old son on another flight. They had to fly from San Diego to Washington DC then to Cancun to make matters worse the weren't even seated near each other!!! How can they do that with a 4 yr old. I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours early and almost missed my flight because it took over 1.5 hrs just to check my bag and then was treated horribly. When we finally got on they plane the flight attendants were not friendly whatsoever and United in their ultimate wisdom decided that 7 meals would be sufficient for this 5hr 50 min flight. I fly at least 4-5 times a year and usually enjoy it. I will never fly United again. It was a nightmare.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;This is the second time I have flown United and it will be the last. The first time all the planes were late and we kept getting bumped to later flights. When we did arrive the luggage did not and it took four days to get the luggage. The second time I flew first class. After we checked in in Toronto we were put into a large area like cattle with no services and then lined up and herded through customs at the last minute so we were unable to get breakfast or buy magazines etc. one bag did not arrive with us but went to Newark instead of San Francisco. On the way home I was bumped to a different seat so I was no longer flying with my spouse and when I called I was told that is just how they roll and even in first class full fare seat booking are suggestions. In the future I will be flying Delta. We flew Delta last year and it was a much different experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;UA1122 23 April 2015 MCO-EWR. UA1690 26 April 2015 EWR-MCO. Flew United First from Orlando to Newark return. Crew very friendly attentive and interested in the passengers onboard. Service by both LAX based crew from Orlando and Newark based crew back was excellent. Drinks always refilled and never any empty glasses or trash around they always cleared it away. Food was brilliant and very tasty. The 757-200 on both sectors was clean tidy and all features of the business first cabin in good working order. The actual aircraft used had the international business first cabin which was a nice bonus with the fully lie flat bed. Over all will definitely be using United again over other carriers.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-05-01;I have never flown United Airlines before. This will be my first and last time. Our family booked our flights in January from San Diego to Florida. Sometime in February the flight time of our second leg of the flight was changed by about 5 minutes. Didn't think much about it. Just yesterday my daughter was checking her seating arrangements and realized that when United changed the second leg of the flight they dropped all our seats. There are no seats available. No help from the United reservation person who I could barely understand. We're all sitting apart. Good thing we checked our seating or we might not even had a seat. I will never fly this airline again and I haven't even been on the plane yet.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-30;It's unbelievable that United continues to use ageing Boeing 747's on transpacific flights. 747's don't even have monitors behind the seats in economy class! Very disappointing when you can't choose what to watch on an 11 hour flight! In addition the level of service is not as good as Asian airlines that I've used on the same route such as Cathay Eva Air Singapore Air etc. When I asked to refill a water bottle the flight attendant said I would need to go to the galley myself to have it filled. I've never received such a response on Asian airlines. Will definitely avoid flying United in the future if I can help it.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-28;I was flying from Ft Lauderdale to Houston this evening in premium class. I was carrying a tote bag small purse a tiny rollerboard and a shopping bag. The guy taking my tickets in a hostile tone told me only two items. I have flown continental for years. Husband was platinum level. This was never an issue so of course I moved aside to comply and consolidated four into two plus purse. Purse an issue so gate checked bag. Fine. Got on board. To add insult to injury. Weather delay due to lightening and hail in Florida and major storm system in Houston area. I had had my United flight diverted last week. We had option to get off the carrier and I elected to get off. I asked rude gate agent if I could retrieve checked bag. No he said rudely. I will never fly them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-24;BCN-EWR. United gets dumped on so much here I wanted to say something nice. Our trip was near-perfect. The flight was full yet the staff were friendly attentive prompt and accommodating in all ways. Very good filling and nutritious lunch plus a pre-landing hot snack. Seating in the Boeing 757-200 was spacious and comfortable. (We sat in their Economy Plus which offered plenty of leg room and I'm six feet tall.) Entertainment was plentiful and varied (I watched three recent movies I had missed in theatres) and the viewing screen was quite large enough. Overall the trip was so relaxing that we still had energy for the final two-hour leg home EWR- ORD which also was quite pleasant.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-24;I took a trip from London out to Rio De Janeiro and from there to Sydney and back home after another stop over in Rio. My travel started on April 1st on UA 5 from London to Houston. I'm a 1k and upgraded this whole itinerary of about 48000 miles of travel from economy to business using mileage and a cash fee. All upgrades cleared in advance allowing me to select my favourite seating which on United one can do free of charge. I continue to be impressed at the level of courtesy and service in United's premium cabins. The vast majority of cabin staff gave very good attentive and professional service. Good simple food but very enjoyable and well presented. The fish dishes continue to be my personal favourite and were quite delicious. Frequent drink refills no need to ask its just given. Some really outstanding flight attendants. Some customers dislike the business class seating personally I have no problem with it. After a nice meal and plenty of snooze inducing beverages I can literally sleep for hours. The only downside in the whole trip was the closure of Houston Airport as a result of thunderstorms on 16/04/15. This could not be avoided or blamed upon the airline. End result I arrived at Rio on my way back 24 hours late. As a 1k a free phone call to a dedicated phone line got me rebooked on the next days flight keeping the upgrade. But I have to say that I did not envy the legions of poor souls who had to stand in line at Houston Airport that night to receive the same service from customer service. It seemed like hundreds of passengers waiting to see one or two agents working at 2am and it was not a pretty sight! All in all thirteen long haul flights apart from the one delayed by weather all other flights operated either on time or ahead of schedule. There are airlines out there that could not even come close to this level of punctuality. And as always my baggage appeared in the right place at the right time. United continues to provide generally very good service in my experience.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-22;I flew from Dulles Washington to London Heathrow on the 7th April 2014 although I was in economy it was the best flight I have experienced I usually sit at the window when I fly but this time I opted for the aisle - it does make life so much easier when flying. Anyway although I was in economy the service was first class the cabin crew were excellent its nice to be looked after by cabin crew with a genuine smile rather than a false grin. The free television on the back of the seat is also a nice addition anyway thanks united for a great trip.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-19;PBI-IAH-LAX-NRT-SIN - original scheduled route. Route actually flown with delays: PBI-IAH-LAX-SFO-HND-SIN. All domestic flights offered only beverages or you could purchase food. Flight delayed due to weather in IAH. Arrived into LAX and my connecting flight had left. Ground service was little to no help. Crew at gate barked to go to Customer service and they only deal with guests at that gate. Customer service had only one person to rebook flights for 40 folks waiting in line. Called 800 number and then was told to call another number to speak to someone about my international ticket. Finally got rebooked but it meant flying to SFO and then onto Singapore. Good part is my flight from Tokyo to Singapore were on ANA. There was a gate change while en-route to Japan. The ANA attendant met me at security to inform me of gate change and asked if I wanted a transport.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-19;"A recent flight from London to New York recently was perhaps the worst experience we've had. We recently flew Nashville - Dallas - San Francisco on United (first class). Food service etc was great. But woe to the huddled masses. For some reason on the return we were bumped to business (first leg) then economy (last leg). For a six hour flight ""breakfast"" was a box with a roll candy bar and yoghurt. But the last leg we were seated in economy and the blinders came off. Seats were probably used on misbehaving prisoners - as ergonomic as a stone carving tattered ""leather"" painfully thin. Video screens (and I use the term loosely) had been randomly attached to the ceiling for which earphones could conveniently be purchased. I'm unsure which is worse - this or the ""individual screens"" on the last AA we flew - scratchy color off glaring possible the worst picture quality on Earth. No problems with bags or leave time.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-19;My wife and I travelled business class Sydney to Tampa Florida via LAX. Sadly a passenger died two hours of Sydney so had to return. Told flight was rescheduled for the next day. As we live in Sydney on the fringe we were told to go home and come back tomorrow. Cab fares were $240 with no reimbursement. Next day plane was an hour late boarding. Business Class cabin carpets were soaking wet. Further delay to clean. Cheap sparkling wine served in plastic cup. Departed Charleston SC sixteen days later back to Sydney via Chicago and LAX. As no internationally trained staff at UA Charleston could only ship bags to Chicago thus to baggage collection/security there. Airline lounge packed in Chicago. At LAX UA lounge was so full we were not allowed in. Then found out no frequent flyer points Sydney-LAX because it was an unscheduled flight.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-19;I flew from IAH to NRT. Not the worst flight but many aspects could be greatly improved. Too much air- conditioning I had to have 3 blankets to keep myself warm. The IFE was better than I expected though. Some acceptable selections to watch. It kept me entertained for the 12 hour flight. Overall probably taking another airline is a better choice for your trip.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-19;On a flight from LAX to New Orleans. Flight 1/2 full with all exit rows empty. My husband and I attempted to move to a exit row seat and was told by the flight attendant we could not move. You have to pay to sit in an exit row. The flight is half empty. United this is our last time fly with you!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-17;Flew to Las Vegas from Amsterdam with a stop at Chicago. Were delayed at Chicago for 3.5 hours with no communication from United staff and 6 gate changes. Onboard entertainment system broke down after 2 hours (on our flight from Amsterdam to Chicago) so we had 6 hours where we had nothing to do but just sit. Flight crew was uninspired. Return flight from Las Vegas to Amsterdam got cancelled 15 minutes before we arrived at McCarran airport because there was no crew available. Eventually flew back to Amsterdam through Los Angeles with KLM. Customer care pointed at Reservations and Reservations pointed at Customer Care. Was on the phone (international call) for over an hour and just got disconnected. Several e-mail back and forth only thing United did was apologize for the inconvenience. Stay away from United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-16;"Flew EWR-AMS-EWR earlier this month. Had extra legroom in Economy Plus. Boeing 757 was very comfortable. Food was surprisingly good. Their ""Asian Vegetarian"" option was a really nice Indian curry. Soft drinks coffee and tea are complimentary and are frequently offered throughout the flight. Crew on both sectors were accommodating and very pleasant. They made quite an effort to make sure we were well fed and hydrated. I was travelling with two very young children and the crew constantly came up to our row and checked in on us. It made us feel welcomed and relaxed. Great in-flight entertainment with lots of great video on demand. Would definitely fly with United again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-14;I was very disappointed with the service and overall experience I received from this airline I had a flight out of Fort Lauderdale Airport at 7.45 am I had arrived early around 6 am with my 4 month old infant. We boarded the flight on time everything seemed to be going as planned until the flight was delayed due to some electrical in the control panel. We ended up sitting on this flight for a good 2 hours waiting as they kept saying sorry and we will update you more in 5 minutes and then 30 minutes and overall a 2 hour wait time until they said we are sorry but we must all exit the plane and wait in line until we could get booked for another flight. Once booked for a new flight they gave us food vouchers the new flight they booked me on was at 2.55pm it was only 11am so I was expected to wait with an infant for another 3 hours - a long day waiting me with my son. I then received a notification on my phone that the flight they rebooked me on had been delayed 90 minutes which would have meant being stuck in Houston airport where my connecting flight was but that I would have missed by the time the new flight had arrived. I was then put on another flight leaving Fort Lauderdale at 5.15pm and arriving to my destination at 11.18pm. I don't think that this was handled well at all especially since I was carrying a child around and had only me.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-14;Flight 1660 from Denver to Houston. This airline is horrible. If you have other options to fly to a location exercise the alternative and pay whatever it costs. Delayed 5 hours. Refused to hold connecting flight despite the fact that over 30 passengers were connecting via that flight. No discounts offered on flights. No ticket offers to fly at no expense in the future to another location. Absolutely horrible customer service. Rude and ineffective agents/representatives. A company that could not care less about customer service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-12;ROC-ORD-JAC and JAC-ORD-ROC. Outbound flights went without a hitch. ORD-JAC segment in an A-320 with new slim seats. Seats were more comfortable than I thought they would be based on previous reviews. Flight Attendants pleasant and made several passes with water for a three hour flight. Return was delayed two hours in JAC. Not a problem for me as I had a 5 hour layover scheduled in ORD. Equipment was an A320 as well and the Flight Attendants were pleasant and attentive. I would give higher marks for seat comfort except both ROC-ORD and ORD-ROC segments were on a regional partner using an ERJ-145. Seating was cramped and the small cabin is not for those with claustrophobia. In all United gets you from point A to point B. They certainly aren't JetBlue.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-12;I've never actually been embarrassed to be seen travelling business class before. I met a colleague at the airport and I was wearing the same clothes for the past 2 days (they cancelled my flight and didn't return my luggage- later found out that they had reinstated the flight but didn't tell me). In front of us both I was told by a flight agent that the flight United had booked me on was full-they didn't even book the other flight! Now my rescheduled flight is delayed another 4 hours.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-12;Overbooked flights planes grounded for maintenance issues replacement aircraft with fewer seats. My flight out of Houston quickly fell apart as the original plane was both over-booked and grounded for maintenance issues. While waiting to find out if there were enough seats for everyone stragglers who had been bumped off previous flights were given seats over those who were actually assigned to the flight. Overall a very poorly executed attempt at damage control.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-10;LAX to MEL on new 787-9 Dreamliner. This is the world's longest 787 route at around 15 hours so I would not even had considered flying United if they were using their old 747 with no IFE. This flight was excellent to the point I was wondering if I was actually flying United. I was in economy plus (which is not premium economy) but the extra legroom for a small surcharge really makes a big difference for such a long flight. The plane was brand new with excellent Panasonic IFE with very clear screen USB and power at every seat Wi-Fi which worked well for the entire trip good food and polite service. This was the best United flight I have ever taken and really feel they have a competitive product on this route (competing with QF A380). The only negative would be that you have to depart from the hideous terminal 7 at LAX. The return flight arrives at TBT to clear customs so think it would be much improved experience if UA international flights could depart from TBT as well.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-10;Had over 3 hour delay for a flight from Chicago to San Diego. After a 1 1/3 hours they finally boarded the passengers and just as the last people were getting on they reassigned the flight crew. Had to wait another hour before a new crew showed up. Another delay because they need more fuel them once we were ready to go we had to delay again because we had to get a new flight attendant because one of them had been on for too long. Complete mismanagement by United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-10;Travelled SYD-LAX-LAS and GCM-IAH-LAX-MEL and found the airline to be well above average. Whilst some of the aircraft are a little older the LAX-MEL leg was on the 787-8 and we were upgraded to premium economy (economy plus) for that leg - possibly the most comfortable flight I have ever been on. Flight attendants were typically very cheerful and despite the large amount of legs no complications with baggage. Food was fine entertainment on the long-haul flights was pretty good. In any respect they performed much above my expectations and don't deserve a lot of the bad rap they get on this site.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-10;I flew United from KIAD to DXB in economy and really liked it. I wasn't very optimistic about the airline when I read reviews on it but United surprised me with how good they were. The ticket was the cheapest I could find. I have flown on several different airlines and United served me one of the best meals I have ever had on a plane. The seats were big and comfortable since United has a good seat configuration. United uses a 3-3-3 seat configuration unlike many airlines that uses a 3-4-3 configuration on their Boeing 777's. The flight attendants were nice and helpful. The inflight entertainment was good with a lot of the latest movies and TV shows that kept me occupied the entire flight. I would recommend this airline to anyone.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-08;I flew from Paris to St Louis (MO) transit at Newark 3 hours flight delay from Newark to St Louis and 4 hours flight delay on the return flight from Newark to Paris. Reasons for delay: aircraft/crew not available plane maintenance etc. Food quantity absurd compared to other airlines. Avoid this airline even if it offers attractive prices it is not worth it.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-08;I flew to New Orleans from Toronto on Air Canada in business class on a cramped and ancient CRA jet which was very substandard compared to what it used to be and returned on United via Newark on a 320 Airbus which was surprisingly comfortable and superior to AC in every department and for nearly half the price than Air Canada charged for the outgoing trip. I will favour United over Air Canada in the future.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-08;Flight 839 Los Angeles to Sydney 4th April 2015. Departed LA near enough on time flight uneventful until approx 3/4 hr before landing. We were informed by the Captain that because of bad weather we were to be diverted to Brisbane. In Brisbane we were told to stay on the plane until further notice. With only minutes to spare before the cut off time for Pilots and Crew expired we approached the runway for our return to Sydney. We only got half way when the Captain announced we were not going to take off as their time had expired. We were taken off the plane and told to wait until a new crew could be found. Almost 12 hrs later and a frustrating lack of information we were told that finally they had a crew but no pilot then we had a pilot but due to administration problems we could not leave. After a 15hr flight and 12 hrs sitting in an Airport we were all tired and at the end of our resolve. We finally arrived in Sydney with a loud applause from all of us passengers 27 hrs later.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-06;"I made my reservation months in advance. I was supposed to have an aisle seat about 5 seats from the back of the plane. When I boarded the plane I was not in that seat. Instead I was put in the very last row by the toilet. I had work to do and tried to power through it despite the terrible seat. The seat would not recline and the gentleman in front of me reclined so there was no room. My head was just inches from his reclined seat (I asked and he agreed not to recline all the way back). I was constantly bumped as people walked to use the toilet and the smell was terrible! I asked the steward why my seat was changed he said it happens all the time. You think you have reserved a seat in the middle of the plane but it is really further back. Otherwise no one would choose the back row. So I was tricked and according to the steward it happens all the time. He made no effort to apologize or make the situation right. It is one thing to realize in advance that the only open seat is by the toilet. It is another to pay that amount of money and reserved far in advance and get ""placed"" in the back by the smelly toilet. I put 1 star for food and beverages because I couldn't eat anything even the food I brought on board because of the smell of the toilet. I put 1 star for the entertainment because it required a credit card. I would have given negative for seat comfort and satisfaction if I could have. I put 1 for staff service as the man in the seat in front of me was hit in the head by the trash bag every time the stewardess went by and she didn't even seem to notice. On the plus side it was terribly windy and the pilot did a good job with the landing.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-06;I have taken several flights with United in the last 2 months (DEN-BOS-ORD-PHL-DEN and DEN-IAH). The online reviews are fairly awful but I have had overall decent to good experiences. All flights have arrived on time and early on a few occasions. Inflight service was overall good with smiling crews. Ground crews have also been reasonable good overall. I have found crews not based in EWR are in general a lot nicer. Inflight Internet worked well overall.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-06;My son and I recently had a connecting flight from Denver to Salt Lake City. When we got off the plane the board said our flight had been cancelled. When we asked why they customer service representative told us that our flight had been chosen at random because of the weather. We were told to either wait at the airport for 12 hours or we could pay for a motel. In my opinion the motel should be provided if the airline has the ability to just randomly cancel flights. What a major inconvenience. The customer service rep was very rude and unaccommodating. I'll never fly united again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-06;UA1464. We flew from Palm Springs to San Francisco then from San Francisco to Calgary yesterday. Excellent flights connections and service.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-06;EWR-SJO-EWR. No-frills airline. All flights were on time but the seats were uncomfortable and cramped there was no free food in coach and the flight attendants were unpleasant and unprofessional. Ever since the merger service has declined and prices have gone up.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-04;I booked a last minute trip from Orlando FL to Hong Kong. The price was OK for few days notice but the in-flight experience was one I would like to forget. In the past I flew overseas with other international airlines from abroad and most treated me and my family very good. With United it was my worst experience flying overseas. Flew from Orlando via Newark to Hong Kong direct. The seats were hard as a rock which made it very hard to sleep. The entertainment system offered all these channels and music that did not work and not available for viewing. The food was terrible and small. It was half the size of a lean cuisine dinner. They charged me $8.00 for a half a can of beer. The attitude of the flight attendants were rude. Returning back to Orlando via Chicago from Hong Kong the flight was an hour and a half late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Orlando. Got no sympathy from service desk and was stuck in Chicago for an extra 4 hours. I will not fly United ever again. Its not only bad service they provide but bad attitudes and they want to change you for every single little amenity. Avoid this airline if you can.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-04-04;BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring. I see no reason why I should not take United again.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-30;The flight is always too full for everyone's carry on baggage. I don't like having to make sure I'm first in line to get onboard just so I know I don't have to check my bag. I had to check my bag the last few trip and wait for an hour for it to come through after landing. I cannot believe they are now charging for inflight entertainment. It's one step too far.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-30;"ORD (Chicago) to OGG (Maui). They notified us that there would be no wi-fi on the flight. Fine. We had media- filled devices so we could tolerate the 9-hour flight. OGG to ORD wi-fi was 'available' but none of our devices (Android and iOS) would connect. Loading for the sign-in page would stop at 80% at the highest but then would hang. Forget about it. Take-off was delayed for loading of 'catering supplies' (food that would be sold to us?). Flight attendants are always rude as if clearly they would rather be doing something other than attending. Waving a hand for your trash dour faces curt language (""You need to [do this or that]."") All this for the privilege of a non-stop flight at an international price. Hello Alaska Airlines.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-30;"ORD (Chicago O'Hare) to OGG (Maui Kahului) round trip. To Maui it was announced that the flight (a B777) would not have wi-fi. Luckily we brought our own electronic devices loaded with media to watch or read on. On the way back wi-fi was available but none of our devices was able to connect (iOS and Android) stuck in ""sign in"" anywhere from 20% to 80%. The home-leg departure was delayed for loading of catering supplies (i.e. food that would be for sale?). Flight attendants are rude as if you were sitting in their furniture without asking. It's easy to use polite language and manners even if you're not sincere yet they could not muster a minimum effort. The price for this flight is quite high as much as ORD to an Asian destination but it seems more like a budget flight. I guess it's because it's a straight flight (no lay-overs). Next time I will try Alaska Air with one stop-over at a much lower price (less than half!).";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-28;"My husband is a frequent flyer with United Airlines in his personal and business travels without incident. In saying that I am a reasonable person I can understand that our flight was delayed and then cancelled due to mechanical problem. However the rudeness of the ticket agents was a total shock to me and most of the other passengers. Staff did not seem to be equipped to handle helping people re-route their flights and were flustered and unprofessional. It is very difficult for me to express my disappointment in the way the situation was handled. The only apologies we received were from the airport security officers who showed up at gate 29. There were no announcements stating that they (the ticket agents) were going to help us with connecting flights there were no apologies for the inconvenience of having to sleep in the airport no announcement that first class passengers and those with small children would be found hotel rooms and others would be left to their own devices to sleep at the gate. Some water and sodas were provided but not enough for everyone. The ticket agents seemed to be ""put out"" in trying to help us. Isn't that their job? I believe that customer service is a huge part of any business and if you don't have good customer service you have nothing. No food vouchers were offered unless asked for this I found out by asking a fellow passenger where he had received his vouchers.It should have been announced that everyone would receive these after a long night sleeping at the gate. The lack of communication was shameless and again unprofessional! I believe there needs to be some training with the staff at United Airlines Maui to help in dealing with situations such as cancelled flights and exhausted guests. And regarding the 125.00 voucher we received for the inconvenience of this debacle doesn't come close to compensating for the discomfort and inconvenience of having to sleep on a filthy airport floor! Horrible customer service made the situation even worse.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-28;Recently flew SFO-IAH-EWR then EWR-ORD-SFO. First class cabin every flight. United's 737-900 series aircraft are nice but the leg room provided hardly warrants first class. Wifi failed on every leg except SFO-IAH. If you navigate off the personal entertainment offering to wifi it is impossible to get back. So if the wifi fails - which it often does on United - you have nothing. Meals were improved over past on a couple of legs the same poor food as on the others. Wines still bad. Boarding ridiculous as Group 1 is now huge with no preference to First Class. I've flown the airline for years because of its dominance at SFO but take other Star Alliance airlines when going overseas. United had delays on both parts of return whereas others I knew on Jet Blue out of JFK (down a runway) got out on time. May be time to give up my 1K and go elsewhere.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-25;I had my first and hopefully last experience with United Airlines this past week. I flew round trip to Orlando with a friend for spring break. Our flight down was delayed three hours because of weather which is admittedly not United's fault however we missed a connection in D.C. and had to fly standby on a later flight that put us at our destination 6 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The return flight was the real terror though. Our first leg from Orlando to Chicago was fine except for the airline insisting on checking our carry ons through to the final destination. Once in Chicago we were told our flight to Burlington was delayed due to mechanical problems. Eventually we boarded the flight an hour late and took off. We then turned back and circled O'Hare for an hour and a half due to mechanical problems before making an emergency landing and having to get off the plane. They then cancelled that flight after leaving us sitting for two hours while they tried to find another aircraft. At that point I was told there was no way to get me to Burlington before Sunday night (my original flight was Friday morning). I tried to book a flight to a nearby city and was told it was impossible to fly anything other than standby. I was booked on a confirmed seat to Albany for Saturday morning and tried two standby flights Friday night. My friend made it out but I ended up in the airport overnight (I was not offered accommodation). When I went to board my flight Saturday morning they informed me that there had been an error and the flight was overbooked. I was bounced from that flight and booked on one departing in the afternoon. The afternoon flight was cancelled due to mechanical problems and I was unable to get out until Saturday night at 11 pm. After all that they refused to even consider shipping my bag until I had landed in Albany (it had been shipped to Burlington on Friday). It is now Monday and I still have not received my bags. Their customer service is unfriendly unhelpful and refuses to let you speak to someone in charge. I will never fly United again and I discourage anyone from doing so unless they don't mind spending hours in an airport without their luggage.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;Business seats not up to international standards. The row of 4 seats in the middle feels like a dormitory. Excellent that an airline would invest in such sub-standard seating. United is my last Star Alliance choice for international travel.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;I booked my trip from UK to Florida via Newark over 8 months ago. I did not realise that the flights would be regularly cancelled or changed. First flight out of Manchester was 3 hours delayed because of staff shortage. Last flight out of Fort Lauderdale was delayed by 4 hours leaving us 30 minutes to run to gate for the flight back to Manchester. There is only one flight a day and we felt we had to make it. Most of staff were not interested in helping us. The whole United experience was a nightmare not the dream holiday we planned. Also the inflight entertainment did not work in my seat.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;Arrived at Calgary Airport only to find out our plane which was coming out of Denver was delayed over two hours due to weather. This will put us in Chicago too late to make our connection. This means we cannot fly out till the next morning. United will not give us a voucher for anything because the delay was not 4 or more hrs. I looked at Denver weather radar and there is no bad weather. Gate people keep saying bad weather. Maybe there was down the line but not in Denver as they are insisting. So they don't have to supply vouchers for this late leg. The week prior I was booked on flight out of Houston. They had to change equipment then we were told it would take a few minutes to do the 'paperwork'. Two hrs later they finally finished. I like being informed and being told the truth. Will not fly United anymore.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;I recently flew United from Shanghai to Chicago on B747-400 in Global First seat 2A. This airline is a disaster. First the boarding. Group 1 which includes first class had about 90 people in Shanghai with the line stretching down the corridor. In fact there were more people in group 1 than in group 4 or 5. So much for First Class. The front cabin of B747 is old and dirty. Seat 2A has more privacy than most but overall the first class cabin is tight with very little privacy and people on top of each other. The seat is long and comfortable and you can sleep. The flight attendants…- one was pleasant and the other really did not care about anything. The food was horrible cold appetizer awful salad. The food lack warmth/taste/presentation. Breakfast was down right disgusting. Maybe this is because on the way to China I flew with ANA and the service is excellent and incomparable. Flying United is not really a first class experience in any shape or form.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;I was very hesitant to fly United again for my family vacation. The first time I flew United I ended up sleeping in the airport when my flight was cancelled. The second time I had two delays that left me on the runway for two hours each. Today I am done. I will never fly United again. Right now I'm in Houston. I was supposed to be in Florida two hours ago. Instead my family of three is sitting in a hotel room with a 4 year old who can't sleep.;NEGATIVE

Horrible experience. Delayed for 2 hours as always. For 9 hours flight they serve very little food cold and bad quality. Rude attendants. No legroom uncomfortable seats  everything is wrong with United. I know learnt to always look very closely which airline the flight is operated by.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-24;I booked a flight to Bahamas through United and it was their Silver Airlines. My flight over was late and coming back the plane had 20 plus passengers and we were all checked in and they delayed our departure. We all missed our connecting flights. There was no apologies no explanations. We were to depart at 2.25 finally getting off the ground at 6.25. Since I was heading to New England there were no seats and I had to purchase a new ticket on a different airline and could only get to Hartford. That ticket cost me $600 and I am very upset with their lack of customer service. My advice don't fly United Silver unless you have make your flights a day apart. This company didn't apologize and kept us in the dark.;NEGATIVE

I was dreading being in the first row since when I'd been in a similar configuration before people stepped over my feet all night to get to rest rooms but now the seats are ""suites"" so no problem. Very comfortable fully lie- flat seats. Food was actually pretty good. Service good. Nice array of films. We chose United for this trip due to price but were pleasantly surprised by how nice it was. Only two bags up to 70 lbs. each even in biz (some airlines allow 3) but overall we were happy. All of our flights were calm but if there was any possibility of turbulence I'd want the announcement to fasten seat belts to be audible to all even those asleep not just on video screens (as one reviewer suggested).";POSITIVE

Because the plane departed late from Cancun we made it through the long lines and customs with 15 minutes left to make our gate. That is until they called me back and said they won't take my luggage. I asked why and was told there was not enough time. We told them we could easily make it to the gate and they refused to let us go. Instead we were sent to the ticket counter to. Rebook our flight. That is when we were told the flights were booked and we might not leave till the next day. They were not willing to work with us at all and it just infuriated us more. We asked to speak to the manager and he also came off as arrogant and took no responsibility for our situation. We ended up having words with him that got us nowhere. That was the last flight with United that we will take.;NEGATIVE

I don't understand why I have to check my bag on the way back but not on the way there. The baggage people were not the nicest and it definitely wasn't an ideal situation. I had to pay a fee that I wasn't planning on paying and I shouldn't have had to pay it. From this experience I would not fly United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE

Both flights on time with good seat comfort (I am 5'11"" 160 lbs.) with the real treat being the new plane and the boeing sky interior. My only gripe was the lack of IFE on the almost 3 hour EWR-PBI leg but with a book and music it was no big deal. Would recommend United for a reliable (but not outstanding) trip quality.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-17;With so many carriers to choose from why would anyone fly United. We flew from San Fran to Boston and were never offered a glass of water. There was no entertainment offered. On the flight out it cost $7.99 for DirectTV and it was not worth it. The 'food' offerings were terrible (Pringles? Trail mix?). There is no leg room and seats barely recline. Is this airline for real?;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-17;We set out from Omaha NE approx. 6am to arrive in Kona HI on Feb. 5th at approx 2.30pm. We had connecting flights in Denver and LAX. We sat on the runway in Omaha for 1.5 hrs with maintenance issues and paperwork past our connecting flight departure time out of Denver. At Denver they shuffled us back and forth between customer service and the boarding gate finally they ended up booking us on a flight to Oahu then Hawaiian Airlines to Kona. When we arrived in Oahu they had no record of us saying United did not have us booked to Kona. After waiting for everyone to board they were able to get us on. We arrived in Kona approx. 6.5 hrs after we expected to missing a 1/2 a day of our vacation time any activities we had booked and no luggage! Our luggage arrived about 11pm at night. Our return flight was not any better. We arrived at the airport early and was told they had a flight leaving shortly and room on it. With our Kona bound experience we thought it may be a good idea to have more time. Before we boarded they had hydraulic problems and the flight was delayed. We were told our tickets were gone for our originally booked flight. So we waited and for once we made it in time for our connecting flight to Denver until we boarded the plane and the starter went out on the plane they brought it back in fixed it but not before we missed our connecting flight from Denver to Omaha. By now we were wondering if this was normal for United? At Denver again we were shuffled around until they finally found a flight into Omaha for us. Our flight experience with United was well below satisfactory levels. The maintenance issues should be a concern for United. I wonder what their Preventative Maintenance plan looks like if they have one at all and or if they should reconsider their Union as paperwork should not take that long. Not sure we will ever Fly United again. On the positive side we made it there and back!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-17;I have never experienced such horrible service as I did this past weekend. I purchased my tickets on Jan 30 2015 for a trip on March 8 2015. Arriving at my destination was a pleasant experience the return was horrible upon receiving my boarding passes I did have a seat assigned in which when I bought my tickets I choose my desired seats. All of this occurred at the Washington Dulles Airport First of all I did not have a seat due to no seating being assigned to me and was told I may not have one due to overbooking. The flight ended up being cancelled due to the crew being late so therefore I was not able to get home because no other flights were being booked for my destination. Spent the night in the airport and when I did reach my destination the next morning my luggage had not yet been shipped. This is terrible service being that this was my first time using United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-17;This was my first time flying with United. I took a trip from Kona HI to Salt Lake City UT. After 30 minutes and not taking off we finally discovered the fuel pump was out. Problems happen so that wasn't an issue. But they continued to have us sit on the airplane for 3 hours and got upset when people stood up even though the plane was not moving. After the three hours they confirmed the flight was canceled. They set everyone up with a hotel and a new flight which was excellent. My next two flights were delayed for over 25 min of the original take-off time making people rush if they had a connecting flight. I was not at all satisfied with how the trip went. My one day of travel turned into three days. On the newer planes the seats were comfortable. The staff were always well mannered and helpful. The food and beverages were good and the inflight entertainment wasn't great but there were a few options on the bigger planes. The small planes only had magazines which are not entertaining at all. I would not recommend United to anyone I care about.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-09;Flight 1570 to Tampa 3/2/15. It is absolutely unacceptable to make everyone board and say final boarding call almost half an hour early and then not have the plane prepared with food and beverages and make us sit on the plane waiting for food. Still sitting here when we should have left an hour ago. Why would you not have what is always needed on the plane? It's not a surprise. Why do we need food and beverage when the flight is 2 hours and everyone wants to leave without it? This is poor service poor planning and poor management. We will not be flying United anymore. I have never had this issue with such a short domestic flight. Unfortunately we had to fly United because we had to travel for a funeral and these were the only flights. Now we just want to get home but now we can't because we need stale pretzels that someone may want to purchase and no one can prepare or tell time. Never fly United the Unfriendly Sky's.;NEGATIVE

We were then told there were no other flights that evening. (It was 8.30pm). The next available flight was at 9.45 the next morning. We were then informed that since the delay was because of ""airport traffic"" United was not responsible for paying for a hotel room for us-she did provide us with a pink card that would allegedly provide a cheap rate for us. After calling the number on the card that this upstanding United Airlines representative had so generously given us we learned that the nearest hotel we could stay at was 50 miles away. We were fortunate to find a ""Parking Spot"" driver who took us to a nearby hotel where many other stranded United Airlines customers ended up that evening.

united-airlines;2015-03-09;I flew from Puerto Vallarta (PVR) to DC with a connection in Houston. There were literally thousands of people waiting to check in to United flights in PVR with lines stretching the length of the entire terminal. Only four check in desks were open one was even closed. There were no announcements and a United rep went through the lines asking for passengers on the next flight only once. Flights out of PVR were delayed by as much as 2 hours or more. There was no help in Houston for people who would miss their connections. I arrived at my gate just before the door closed and the sullen attendant at the desk refused to ask permission for me to board. A few minutes later the door even opened to let out a passenger who had been checked into the wrong flight and the (now two) attendants refused to try to get me on board. This was the last flight out to DC and as a result I had to stay overnight in Houston. All told it took me 26 hours to travel from PVR to DC entirely due to United's incompetence and non-existent communications. A true nightmare.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-04;R/T Portland to London Heathrow via Chicago. The outbound leg on antique 757 and 767s made me long for the good old days of air travel circa 1995. Far more comfortable than the return leg on brand new 777 and A320s. The older aircraft had wider seats and the flight from Chicago to London was less than half full so I had a full row to myself. The newer aircraft were by comparison more cramped had uncomfortable seats and were completed packed per the norm. The seat back entertainment systems were non-functional. Food was ok. Nothing special but edible. Flights were on time. Overall a satisfactory experience given that the airfare was a bargain.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-04;"Just got hosed by United's new international luggage policy. Flew from US to Grand Cayman Island last week. No longer do they allow the usual 1 checked bag free which is the standard on international travel. $25 for my wife's bag and $25 not overweight not oversized just a regular bag. Seems now any checked bag now is charged for shorter international flights. Plus to make matters worse for some bizarre reason Grand Cayman will not let you go through security with a fly rod despite having flown all around the world with one and no problem from any other security. So now this has to be checked which becomes a 2nd checked bag at $40. $40 for a couple 30"" long by 1 1.2"" diameter tubes taped together! At least that one was only on the return leg. I travel a lot and while I cant say I will never fly United again since there are limited options anymore but it will flat out have to be my only option to a place I really want to go to. They even require you to pay if you wanted to watch the flight information screen which is just a GPS screen with a plane drawn on it showing where you are on a map!

The check-in and gate agents were wonderful as usual but the flight was delayed two hours before taking off from Miami. I completely understand this but I feel that more could have been done to get on the plane sooner. I cannot complain about the seats they were comfortable and made of leather (or a similar material). However I was appaled by the lack of entertainment. To a completely literal extent the options consisted of SkyMall United's horrifically boring magazine and the one radio station I could hear which seemed to be an 80's synth station. There was no Wifi no plugs and no TVs not even one. I believe this is a remnant of United. I flew the same route on Continental in 2010 and I received sufficient television programming.

Dinner was very good as was the pre-landing snack while the screens were not the biggest the choice of entertainment was huge. The main differences between this flight and the tip-top level of service were the absence of warm towels and the lack of juice service during the in-between hours. Those are trivial. United offers an excellent product and the 777 is well maintained.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-03-04;2 weeks ago my husband and I went to New Zealand. For years we travelled with Air Canada or Air New Zealand and this last time we made a big mistake and decided to fly with United. We prolonged our arrival to Auckland by a few good hours but we would have co-oped with these extra hours had it not been for the awful time on the flight to and from Auckland. There is no room for peoples legs. This is a very long flight and airlines need to consider peoples health. The food was awful. Cold and not edible. The flight attendants beyond rude. I was shocked when 2 of them who could not decide if the liquid in the pots was tea or coffee simply removed the lids and put their noses in. When we got to Sydney Australia we embarked on an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland. What a huge difference. All of the sudden we could stretch our legs. The food was edible and the flight attendants were courteous. Going back home to Canada the experience repeated itself. We flew Air New Zealand to Sydney and everything was good and then hell repeated itself when we had to embark Untied from Sydney to Canada. My husband and I decided that never again will we fly United.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-02-24;"Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation. If a medical kit was on-board it wasn't made available to the medical personnel who tried to provide assistance and it took 15 minutes for the Flight attendant to bring a wet towel to help cool the patient down. Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did.

The next day we had to go in search of our own luggage at the ""lost luggage"" distribution center. United Customer service staff was of no help. Talk about the unfriendly skies.";NEGATIVE

Golly how expensive would it be to let people watch the TV news on an all-day plane ride or allow 'free' Wi-Fi which is free everywhere else in the western world? A few snacks anything? Had a lovely cheerful flight attendant between San Francisco to Newark but all the airline nickel-and-diming takes all the fun out of what used to be half the fun: getting there-or back. It's as though they hate their passengers and make the trips as miserable as possible seats too narrow for a normal rear end aisles two skeletons could not pass in no place to put your legs if you have two seats that recline an inch and a half charges for even a small bag everything. Back to cars and trains or staying home I think it is just too exhausting and annoying and expensive to fly anymore.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-02-24;My wife and I flew business/first class on United Airlines from Maui to Denver with a plane change in LAX. Our flight on 2/5/2015 from Maui to LAX was UA417 an ancient 757-200. We paid a total of $4924.40 for two round trip tickets. Flight 417 was more like riding an old dusty city bus. Keeping in mind that we were in first class we were offered only a small bag of potato chips. That was it. We were told that there were no more snacks and we could have only one bag of chips. The flight attendants mainly sat in their jump seats the whole time just chatting or snoozing. The purser was pretty snotty when asked any questions. We had the old style seats that didn't recline much. And beyond our belief on the ongoing flight from LAX to DEN we had lay-flat beds. For a flight lasting less than two hours. We sure could have used those lay-flat beds for the over-ocean portion. We've avoided United for several years now and from now on will continue to avoid them.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-02-24;Recently flew from Sydney to the US on United and a bunch of internal flights within US and returning home on United. Read a lot of negative reviews about United before I travelled so was a bit sceptical about the whole experience. I'm an average meat and three veg type of guy if I pay a beer price I don't expect to get Champagne service. Who does? I was more than happy with the service provided given the fares I paid. I recall only once one of the internal flights was delayed and it really wasn't a big deal. I would definitely fly with United again. I really think some people need to get a grip they want silver service for bargain basement prices. You get what you pay for and I was more than happy with United. No hesitation to fly with them again.;POSITIVE

No apologies were made or compensation provided. In the future will prefer any other airline to United and are considering canceling our United credit card. Worst airline in business today.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-02-24;Flying UA in F (oxymoron alert) from ORD to NRT. Our 13-hour flight was delayed for three hours after we had boarded because of radio issues. About 30 minutes into the wait they opened up the main door and with temps outside around zero the F cabin quickly became a freezer. I could actually see the breath of the pax in 4A. The cabin itself was tired and dirty with tissues stuck between my seat and the wall. The toilet rubbish bin overflowed about halfway through the flight and was never emptied. The toilet seat was filthy by the end of the flight. WiFi was broken. On the bright side the amenity kit comes with a United-branded ballpoint pen and comb. The food apart from a cold but well-cooked tenderloin steak was largely inedible. The “sausage” that came with the dry crusty omelette was a hard brown puck of mystery meat. Food in ANA Y is far better. There was no wine list because there were only four mediocre wines and some cheap sparkling in 375ml bottles. Service was not rude for the most part but below economy standards on any Asian carrier. I had to wait 10 minutes to get a cup of dishwater coffee. When the woman seated next to me asked what the squid sushi was the FA replied (with a smile to be fair) “Don't ask me I don't make it.”The shoulder harness that F pax are required to wear on takeoff and landing was extremely uncomfortable. When I remarked on this (politely and with a smile) to the FA while putting mine on she patronizingly replied “We can endure anything for a few minutes Mr. Johnson.”Will never ever fly United long-haul again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-02-24;I have flown United my whole life. It had been ten years since I had flown. This last week we flew from the mid west to the pacific coast using nothing but United.

The dinner was OK but there was no style in its presentation-or of any of the meal. The crew was present when necessary but had no real interaction with any passengers that I observed. The breakfast was insipid. Again poorly presented eggs lukewarm and the potato patty was soggy and blah as was the some-kind-of sausage patty. All in all it was a simply so far off the ""First Class"" moniker that I arrived feeling nothing but annoyance. The return from Narita was much better. United still lacks any sense of presentation or style but the crew was friendly present and engaged. The meals were both better than those on the inbound more tasty and hot but still far off the mark that is achieved by other airlines not only in First but even in Business.

St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later. I recommend United and usually don't have issues with them and plan to fly them again in the future.;POSITIVE

Actually really surprised at the comfort of the seat despite all the negative press about the new Slimline product. Of course this flight was only about 30 minutes but for a regional hop not bad at all. Continuing segment was on A319 in F. Seat was moderately comfortable but pitch was lacking and by the end of this 3 hour flight I was definitely eager to deplane. Service was attentive and professional however and drinks were consistently refilled. Food could have been better but what else is new. Overall I was pleased with this journey and despite being loyal to AA would consider UA again if traveling to one of their hub cities.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-02-18;"I have no idea why they call travelling United ""flying the friendly skies"". I have not seen even one friendly FA during my two flights. During SJU-EWR leg we weren't even greeted while boarding the plane. It felt like a sarcastic joke when they showed a safety video at the beginning of the flight with smiling crew greeting you since all you see on board is sad tired unprofessional crew. The flight was 90 minutes late due to an electronic glitch in one of the plane's systems. Even though many were going to miss their connections in FRA there were no apologies given - just a statement of facts. Pilot announcements consisted of mumbling something intelligible into a PA system couple of times and when it was brought to the attention of a FA she responded ""Oh yes I know I could not understand him either"". Thirdly it is a meal service. Food itself was inedible but this is a common trend of many airlines so I did not have any expectation in regards. The main issue was what they call service on board United or total lack of it. There were no smiles no ""enjoy your meal"" no ""what would you like"" just appalling ""what do you want"" and throwing it at your table - truly ""the friendly sky""! There was a row and a half of passengers forgotten during the beverage service and FA had to be reminded to serve us some drinks. I understand mistakes and miscommunication may happen but a little ""sorry"" would be the right word to say. There were none! And lastly is the seat comfort. I understood that new United modus operandi of the economy class is to squeeze you towards the back of the plane into old uncomfortable seats with no leg room (in which no one should be allowed legally to seat for more than 2 hours) so you would spend a hundred or so bucks for the Economy Extra next time you fly with them. I also however do believe that even the most affordable on-board service class should include some basics of travel and hospitality: decent amount of leg room (not extra but just sufficient) acceptable service and a friendly crew. Anything beyond that should be considered extra and come for a price of course that customer will chose to pay or not. Since United has obviously different point of view in this regard I will avoid flying them next time.";NEGATIVE

On a recent full flight from Newark to Los Angeles a new super skinny seating was encountered that climbs to a whole new altitude of pain and suffering. When reputable airlines change to slim seats the airline gets more seats on the plane and passengers get a bit more legroom but at United this would never fly. United now using Continentals short-haul 737-900s on long-haul routes has extra extra seats that don’ t quite fit. To make passable exit row clearance seats behind are compacted to even less than their typical 30-inch seat pitch on this aircraft - less than the 31-inches specified for many other flights - and much less than the 32-inches United advertises when selling economy seats. My seat had only 2-feet clear butt-to-shin with perhaps an additional 4-inch knee-high seatback thickness - probably a 28-inch pinch - or less! When the passenger in front tried repeatedly to recline - there being no extra room it was impossible. The passenger drew a cabin attendant to complain that I would not allow the seat to recline. The attendant seriously explained to me that the passenger had purchased a ticket entitling them to my leg space and may fully recline the seat. Unfazed the attendant told me that if I wanted extra legroom I should have purchased an“Economy-Plus” seat. I asked how much it would cost but there were no free seats - at any price. I explained that I did not need extra legroom just sufficient room - which they were not providing. Not reconciled to the laws of physics the attendant continued insisting that this was all my fault - that I was taking up space that I was not entitled to - and had me turn sideways putting my knees in the aisle so the seat could recline. My shoulder was now in the way of the seat. I could not turn back either and complained that the vending carts would hurt my legs even more than the seatback. Only then did the attendant finally suggest that the other passenger switch seats with their adjacent small child. For $25 a luggage bag had more space than me - and was treated much better!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-30;My family and I flew United for the last time over the holidays. We bought tickets the previous March in order to get direct flights to the west coast and seats together. We chose to fly out of Logan - very inconvenient for us but the only airport offering a direct flight. A few weeks before our trip we received an email telling us that our flights had all been changed. Now we were leaving hours earlier getting in hours later with stopovers both ways. These flights were on Christmas day and New Year's Eve - clearly a few hours made a huge difference. Also our seats were no longer together. I will never fly United again. Customer service is terrible.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-28;Never again will my family and I fly with United Airlines! We flew in from Sacramento to San Fran and we missed the connecting flight to Hawaii because of their delays. We had to wait 2 hours then fly up to Seattle and then to Hawaii which made a 5 hour flight over 6 hours! On the way back from Hawaii we had a flight connecting us from LAX to Sacramento but missed it once more because we were sitting on the Tarmac for 40 minutes doing nothing. There were no more flights to SAC so we had to spend the night in LA. My husband 2 sons and I are now missing work and my 2 other children are missing school. Missing the flight once was bad enough but a second one is totally unacceptable. Both times the planes we needed to get on were sitting there and we were only late by minutes and they wouldn't let us on. We missed a whole day in Hawaii because of it. Also on the flight with UN from Hawaii to LA there was no complimentary food.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-28;London to Costa Rica via Newark. Check in was quick and efficient. flight to Newark left on time and we landed 20 minutes early. The 777 was clean well equipped and comfortable. In Flight service excellent and food and drinks plentiful and good including the ice cream and caramel that was very impressive. Transit through Newark was somewhat long but that is nothing to do with the airline. Flight Newark to Costa Rica was on time. Aircraft was a 737 of some age but the seat was fine and the crew excellent again. Food and drinks again good for a short haul flight. So my experience of United was a good experience and well worth trying as the tickets are good value and extremely competitive against other carriers.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-28;MDT-IAD-LAS-ORD-MDT. Other than the leg from Dulles to Vegas the trip was largely a non-event. Even that leg the only real complaints I have is that it (B-737) was fully booked and the WiFi system on the plane was spotty. I do not recommend paying for the on-board WiFi systems until you've spent some time in the 'complimentary' area to make sure the system is working properly. The MDT-Dulles leg was a 25-minute trip not especially worth discussing. The Embraer 145 is a nice little plane the single-seat arrangement on the one side of the cabin does make a nice opportunity to get both a window and aisle seat. LAS-ORD was aboard an older 757. Seats were more comfortable than the 737 but in-flight entertainment was limited to basically an old Discovery Channel program on overhead CRTs. On the other hand it was free so I guess you get what you pay for. This plane was also fully booked but got lucky with a smaller woman in the center seat. ORD-MDT was aboard an A-319. Seats were comfortable. Inflight entertainment was available over a wi-fi connection to my tablet. Worked like a charm. Large selection of programming. Plane was about 80% booked and I got lucky with an empty center seat. On all 4 legs cabin crew was attentive and reasonably pleasant. Flights were on time or at least close enough that I had no trouble making connections. Notes: Bring a tablet or something to occupy yourself with. When the in-flight entertainment is right it works well. When it's not you'll be twiddling your thumbs without some way of entertaining yourself for hours. Do use the United app. Having the boarding pass on the smart phone - and getting all the necessary updates through the app - made things easier. It worked reasonably well. When traveling within the US (on any airline) don't go non-stop coast to coast. 5 hours on a fully-loaded plane is miserable (and lets face it they're all close to fully loaded today). An hour layover in some place in the middle is now a welcome respite and no longer a nuisance. Be prepared for delays. Stuff happens on every airline - mechanical and weather. My reading of the other reviews complaining about United strike me as largely problems that every airline is guilty of in some way shape or form. It is simply the reality of airline flight in 2014. Airline travel just isn't what it was 20 years ago when the planes were half full so there was more room and the cabin crew was not so rushed.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-28;Flight 914 from CDG to MCI with connection at Washington Dulles on Jan 14 in Economy class. The product featured by United is sub-standard. Of course ageing aircraft in the main leg (767) is clean and well maintained and this is the minimum you can expect from one of the largest airlines in the world. Check-in boarding operations baggage everything ok. Seats are standard. VOD is poor with very limited options and not user friendly. The music program was out of order for this flight and films not plenty. Besides on individual screens maps are not detailed and this system is less advanced than 20 years ago (I am not joking) in Asian companies. Also flight information is given exclusively in feet inches miles just if the metric system does not exist in the rest of the world! Regarding meals they are almost edible. We had chicken with some sauce (more sweet than sour) a large salad with a too smallish cup of dressing (good) and a kind of sponge cake pompously christened crumble – wrapped in a cello paper printed European quality but made in Alabama. All in a very small slippy tray complimented with picnic cutlery (100% plastic). And of course passengers have to pay 7.99 $ for one beer. Ridiculous. By the way a sandwich (not bad) was served before landing but do not expect more than water between meal and snack. Fruit juices ice creams and other open bar is a dream out of reach at United. Attitude of cabin crew very professional (attendants have apparently about 20/25 years experience) working efficiently but not cheerful (friendly skies really?) in very bland uniforms which could be copied from Railways of the 70’ Being familiar with Asian and Middle East airlines I find United well below what you may expect from such a large corporation.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-28;United Premium Economy is a gamble it seems to be directly dependent on the type of aircraft you are flying. On a 777 the seats are nice and spacious the services (seatback entertainment) are premium and you can really feel the extra legroom making the extra charge totally worthwhile. On a 747 the opposite is true I had more room in Economy on an Airbus than I did in Premium Economy on a 747. On the 747 I couldn't even fit my very small backpack under the seat in front of me and what little legroom I had was obstructed by a large piece of plastic. The aisles were noticeably narrower as well which made every beverage service an exercise in getting smacked with a cart (not fun on a 13 hour flight). I did notice there was an extra seat in every row on the 747 which is probably were all that extra room went. Also relying on the old school movie screens meant that even if you were trying to sleep a bright light was shining in your face. On the bright side as always the crew were nice courteous and professional. Long story short though? If you're going to spring for the Economy Plus make sure you're on the right type of plane it makes a big difference.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-26;"I flew to London on the so called ""Dreamliner"". United is so bad they have now changed out the seats in coach to the same tiny seats for short commuter flights. United plus is not a better seat or service just more leg room which is the least of the issues unless your over 6 feet tall. Beer and Wine are now $7 each! They are free on European airlines with more comfortable seats. I used to be bothered when they cancelled direct flights from Houston to Paris. Now I don't have to chose between United and Air France!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-26;We had truly horrible service from the first flight out to the last flight of the return trip. United booked us to fly into Newark to connect with a flight out of JFK - we got the joy of finding this out when we checked in. On the return flight from Zurich the cabin crew announced that they were short staffed due to management cut- backs. Translation in our case where we were seated near the rear of the plane is that we got one small sandwich six hours into the flight. I would have killed for a glass of water and maybe some food. Then our connecting flight to Raleigh was cancelled due to 'weather' and therefore we were responsible for our own sleeping arrangements. The 'weather' in Raleigh was drizzle. Our bags went American and arrived on time. A complaint to United was not even met with an apology. Instead they offered of a $100 voucher for future travel with them!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-26;I try to avoid flying United when I can but as I was with Continental I sort of inherited their frequent flyer program. So my review is of a recent flight this last summer but also of their frequent flyer plan which unless you are a Business flyer I would avoid. It's almost impossible to move up to Gold with them. I flew 50K miles flew on them 4 times but failed to spend 5000 dollars on their tickets because I live overseas and usually fly Turkish and claim the miles because I thought they were in the same alliance which it turns out isn't really true - at least not for United. The flight we took was from London to Houston. Cancelled because it's United and we were placed on a flight to NYC in an effort to get us to a flight that connected to Texas which we missed so then they put us on a flight to Chicago so that they wouldn't have to pay for a Hotel etc ad nauseam. Funnily enough our flight back to London from Texas had one leg cancelled because it's United and they told us to drive from Austin to Houston but that's another story altogether. The plane we were on from London to NYC was just about clean enough my gluten free meal was gone because it's United (My flight had been cancelled and my meal with it) and the entertainment system was down because it's United. Needless to say I am now with the FF program of Turkish Airlines and will never fly United again unless it's impossible due to US monopolistic practices. Don't fly United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-23;LAX-MEL - B787-8 - Overall a good flight. Equipment changed from a B787-9 to a B787-8. Not too disappointed since it was still a Dreamliner but the change to the smaller aircraft had the consequence that a baby was moved from the forward business class to the 3 Business rows in the mid-section. A baby on 16 hrs flight - not recommended. Flight departed from LAX 1.5 hr late. Basically waited on board for 1.5 hrs. Everyone had already boarded so we were in this plane for at least 17 hrs. Flight uneventful new Dreamliner is a really great airplane large windows very airy cabin. Seat is good except that not every seat has direct aisle access. Inflight Entertainment great good selection of movies TV shows. Service was attentive (above usual United average) Food was decent. Unfortunately United does not supply their Business customers with Fast passes for Melbourne Airport Immigration so waited almost 1 hr to get through on top of the 1.5 hr delay. All in all a great plane and can recommend if you are traveling to Melbourne.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-21;"I am currently sitting on the flight that was supposed to depart at 6.05 am from NY to Dayton. It is 6.40 am and we have not taken off. We have been sitting on the plane for almost an hour due to ""maintenance issues."" I am not going to make my connection and this is after the exact same issue on the flight I took to NY. I was sceptical to book a flight with United based on anecdotal experience with friends and family but now I am experiencing it first hand on both legs of the trip. The first flight of the day and it is delayed? It is evident how United does business. By the way no word on when we are leaving.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;TLV-ORD via EWR business first. Comfortable seat and was able to sleep for 7 hours. Dinner OK good entree nice service. Seats flat and convenient. Breakfast OK. Catering could be better but reasonable. Staff constantly in cabin during dinner and breakfast. Liked catering on Austrian and Turkish better. EWR United club nice showers and service from club staff but mediocre offering of snacks.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;EDI-EWR UA37 on B757-200 aircraft on the last day of 2014. (Part of a ‘P’fare booking EDI/EWR/PBI and return). Checked-in at the dedicated business class desk and was advised that UAL use the ‘Aspire’ lounge at EDI. The lounge was fine with a reasonable selection of food items for a snack breakfast. Flights are not called from the lounge. Boarding appeared to be well managed a number of supplementary security / travel questions were asked by an agent at the gate. Once onboard a welcome drink of champagne juice or water was offered. There is a 2-2 flatbed seat configuration in Business Class. The seat was comfortable with plenty of space and easy-to-use chair and In Flight Entertainment controls. The plane Departed on time at 09.05. On board service began roughly 45 minutes after departure. The main meal was lunch followed by a snack prior to arrival at EWR. In my opinion this is where UAL need to put more thought into what is offered. In view of the time of day prior to 10.00 a full breakfast or brunch rather than a lunch might have been a better catering option? The service from flight attendants was efficient although some of them appeared to be a bit tired looking. Small touches such as addressing passengers by name were absent on this flight. This was done on the inbound UA36 EWR-EDI 8 Jan 15 in comparison. The flight arrived at EWR around 35minutes ahead of schedule this was partly due to an on board medical emergency situation. Overall the flight was a pleasant and efficient experience. I would use UAL again in Business Class subject to obtaining a fare at a suitable price!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;UA163 GUM-ICN 1/5/2015. We sat in the airplane 1.5 hours before departure due to a missing logbook. Add 5.5 hours to destination makes 7 hours total time in ac. Breakfast was served it was small and below standard. Flight attendants were hard to find for any extra drinks. 2.5 hours prior to destination captain turned on fasten seat belts sign due to turbulence hence terminating inflight service. There was no turbulence we were on top of the cloud layer. There was no turbulence during descent as well. I feel the seat belt sign was turned on to avoid further service to passengers. Inflight entertainment was poor quality. The small movie screen had continuous static making it impossible to watch.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;MAN to EWR RT BusinessFirst. I have been a loyal CO customer for about 20 years and have tried so hard to like the new United but my patience has definitely worn out. The service inboard is simply too hit or miss and increasingly miss. The FA's treat passengers like a necessary evil to be served minimally and with zero smiles or grace. The service is functional at best and once completed the FAs hide behind the curtain. Worst still their planes are already showing signs of ageing - on the outbound flight my moms seat reclined minimally and then jammed so she had to spend the rest of the flight bolt upright (she refused to switch with me). Notably the same seat was still broken 10 days later when she took the same flight home on clearly the same plane. Crew were indifferent to the seat problem. BA and Delta both have far more dependably good service and UA has simply stopped trying. I did a DL Gold status match for 2015 so will ditch UA after all these years. Shame but they just don't deserve my business anymore.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;This was my first and last time flying with United. I am a frequent Delta and Southwest traveler and was beyond disappointed with my experience on United. Our second flight was cancelled and it took someone over 15 minutes to inform us of this cancellation-additionally I was not notified via their app about this cancellation. It was 10am and they claimed they had no way to get us home that day unless we spent $80 to take a shuttle to another airport and then took two more flights from there. They then charged us three times for our bags. Overall (not including the two extra bag charges) this cost us an additional $180 and they refused to pay for a cent. I will never fly this airline again. Also as a side note as we spent the entire day in the airport we noticed that they overbooked every single flight some flights were overbooked by more than 10 people! Terrible airline-poor customer service and extra fees for everything (snacks bags television etc.);NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;IAH-GIG-B767/400. In the morning on United Airlines on-line check-in I could see that Aircraft would not be a 777 but a 767. At night  on departure mess was absolute. Seats had been re-marked separating couples etc.. Departure was delayed 2 hours due to Cargo issues resulting of Aircraft change (which was NOT unexpected). Late 1h45 mn at arrival in Rio. No Amenities pouch (why?). Unacceptable food for International Business class: Ugly and dry. Overcooked. IFE was the same as 2 months before. How ? Seat remains flat and comfortable. FA's tried their best but passengers were upset.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;On our way back from Cancun we had a stopover in Houston. The flight from Cancun was delayed 1.5 hrs leaving us under 40 minutes to go through customs re-check our bags and get to a different gate in another terminal. We did not make our connecting flight. Along the way there were no helpful attendants and no actions taken to give us even a fighting chance to get to our gate. They attendants on the plane had no information about gates connecting flights or any other helpful info. We missed our connecting flight to New York. We kept getting sporadic ever- changing alert texts from United. Sometimes the flight was delayed by 2 hours and then reverted back to half an hour. We did not received a comped hotel and had to spend additional money staying the night at Houston. We were re-booked onto a flight the next day at 10.21 am. We arrived at the airport approximately two hours before the flight. Tthe flight was delayed 54 minutes and would now be departing at 11.15am. Shortly after we were told that the flight was delayed for 2.5 hours departing at 12.45pm. Having been up and at the airport since early morning we were famished. We decided to use the restrooms and grab a quick bite to eat as we had a 4-5 hour flight ahead of us. In that extremely brief time the flight time was reverted to 11 am. We received the notification at 10.30. After the flight was delayed 2.5 hours we made the rational decision to eat something in the meanwhile. Does United expect that it's customers not get up from their seats to relieve themselves get a drink of water or a quick bite to eat after having waited at the airport for so long? We missed our connecting flight again due to incompetence and poor customer service. We immediately went to an agent where we again received attitude and condescending lectures. I travel back and forth from the United States just to Canada alone at least 7x (round trip) a year. We recommend you stay away from this airline.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;Dallas - New York - Stockholm. I have previously promised to never fly United again after a couple of extremely poor flight and customer care experiences. Now I end up on two United flights once again because that seemed to be the only option. This time the experience was slightly better. The staff is still a bit grumpy the entertainment system is below average the food is among the worst I have had in the air and the check-in processes are a bit strange. Nevertheless I ended up coming home on time without being too frustrated!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;Flying now United Airlines round the world starting from Europe. Never again on a UA flight unless it is the last choice. They started me on a feeder flight from Oslo to Frankfurt only to tell me that they pushed me 24 hours on their flight to Chicago because they simply cancelled the flight that day. I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage. Tough luck same flight number means 2 different airplanes on the two legs and no margin to be late crossing the Pacific. 6 hours waiting with shifting to Haneda. Business class and Star Alliance Gold card means nothing to UA's level of service. Never UA again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;I flew from San Francisco to Managua and the overall value and service was typical for United. United has the worst food and in-flight entertainment in the industry. The flight attendants want to serve you food immediately after the flight begins so they can chatter in the forward and rear galleys of the airplane. Low fat potato chips and cookies are not a snack they are the lowest cost food options that you can offer your customers. United Airlines overall is of the worst carriers for inflight services in the airline industry. I was in Business/First and they wanted me to pay for both the internet and DirectTV why don't you just consider me a customer that hates your airlines and that will avoid you at all costs.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;"Newark to Fort Lauderdale on 13th January 2015. Flight on time and aircraft clean. Decent seats with good legroom in premium economy. What lets them down in the complete disinterest and discourtesy of their staff from check in and throughout the journey. No smiles no interaction no welcome on boarding just generally no customer interaction at all. I am a silver member and frequent flier with BA and their staff are far far superior in terms of customer interaction at all points in the journey. Overall not a bad airline at all they just don't live up to their logo ""Fly the friendly skies"".";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;SFO-SEA-SFO. A320 + B737/900. Late on departure in both cases. On time at arrival in both cases. No frills. Check- in smooth and as an alliance gold no baggage cost.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-19;Every flight I was booked on today was late or canceled. I am sure the airlines would say not our fault but it was late planes. Mechanical failures that blocked gates. First officers that don't show up and scratches on the bottoms of wings that mysteriously grow while the FO can't be located. Two guys booked on the flight decided to drive to Indy because it would be faster than flying. Not a ringing endorsement.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2015-01-14;LAS-SFO B737-900 and SFO-SYD B777-200. First leg was a short flight on a new plane soft drinks served courteous crew seats were just average but still too short flight to complaint. Second leg killer flight to Australia almost 15 hrs upgraded to Economy plus which was disappointing because basically is the same as economy with just a wider seat pitch that gave me more leg room and a comfortable sleep. Food just fine the trays are getting smaller and smaller crew was nice and attentive plane a bit old IFE average small screens with a good selection. I have no problems flying UA again but it has to be a really good deal as it is oceans apart compared to Qantas or Air New Zealand on the same routes down under.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;The flight attendants on the flight from MEL to LAX couldn't have been more attentive efficient and professional. Same on the LAX to NY and LAX to MEL. Food was reasonable drinks were served regularly cups of water offered often and service was second to none. I had heard all manner of criticism about United beforehand however decided that given the effort by United to revamp the airline putting the 'Dreamliner' into service non-stop between MEL and LA it was only fair to give United a fair chance. United Airlines staff were nothing short of fantastic having arranged assistance for me on arrival at the various locations - in general over and above their call of duty.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;"Flew from LAX-LHR in Global First on the 777-200. Pros - Overall it is a very comfortable seat nice and soft bedding with a mattress pad small cabin (only 8 seats) great inflight entertainment system and friendly service. Cons - Food was subpar for international first and the appetizer was a spring roll and a coconut rubbed shrimp skewer - very similar to what you might find in a cheap cocktail party. Soup was served in a teacup sized bowl main was ok desert was ok too if you like ice cream as that is the only option. If United wants to compete with other international first class it needs more refinement style and ""class"" in their product. As I used award miles for this seat it was perfectly fine. I would only fly first on an upgrade or on an award ticket otherwise it is not worth the money.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;I was astonished that 3 out of 4 flights of my honeymoon were delayed. In fact 2 of the delayed flights were more than 2 hours delayed. We flew 28th May 2014 LHR-SFO which was on time where we were supposed to catch a flight to HNL. The HNL flight was over an hour late in departure. On our return trip on 18th June 2014 the HNL-IAD flight was more than 2 hours late and the connecting flight to LHR on 19th June was boarded then disembarked as the plane was faulty - and we ended up with a 3 hour delay. No one at the airline seemed particularly bothered or apologetic.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;Flew from San Diego to Mobile. On all 4 flights they didn't have my husband and I sitting together. We talked to customer service at both airports and they refused to make any changes unless we paid $59 to upgrade to an extra leg room seat. To add insult to injury you have to pay for your luggage pay for the direct TV pay for any snacks - not even a peanut for free.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;"FRA-EWR-PHX-EWR-ZRH. FRA-EWR on old 767-300 with a tiny little screen in front of you that shows some movies on channels. Own earphones did not work. Plane very loud. However seat quite comfortable very nice cabin crew and good and tasty food. Legroom officially at 31in. but feels bigger than on transatlantic BA or AF. Brought my own entertainment so I had an excellent flight (should have brought earplugs though). EWR-PHX on newly refurbished A319 with slimline seats. Again lots of legroom even for me (6'6"" / 2m) and again no IFE but wifi available. But again a nice crew with two full drink runs (alcohol for purchase) and some walk throughs with water. PHX-EWR on 737-700 also with new interior and AVOD. However this is provided by DirecTV cost is $5.99 for flight of two hours or less and $7.99 for flight of more than 2 hours. Sadly even the flight information part is enclosed here so you don't see it unless you pay for it. Again two drink runs and good service by nice flight crew. Of the four planes on this trip this one had the worst legroom but still OK. EWR-ZRH on 767-400. Old plane with brand new interior - and a good one at that. Slimline seats with a big screen in front of you a large choice of new movies games and shows. Legroom again very good the 31in. at United appear to be bigger inches than those on other airlines. Tasty dinner and small breakfast (with fresh fruit!). After reading many bad reviews I had mixed feelings about stepping into a United plane. I even considered doling out the (quite big amount of) $$ for Premium Economy. But I got corrected. All planes were clean and well maintained nothing rattled or fell of. The crews were all nice and helpful. Legroom was never an issue even with pax in front of me reclining. After this experience I highly recommend United. Before you fly - find out if you have to bring your own entertainment (or pay for it)!";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2015-01-14;Stuck in Belize for 7 hours because the plane did not leave Houston. No further explanation on the matter except that the plane never left. The United staff that rescheduled our connecting flights was extremely rude and not helpful at all. It almost seemed as if she was taking joy in the fact that we were all stranded there. Then every passenger was forced to stay the night in Houston. My flight was supposed to be the first flight out of Houston leaving at 7am so I get to the airport at 5.30 am to find out that now it doesn't leave until 9:00. Every single staff me member I've encountered or asked for help from is miserable and rude. This was a one time thing but I will never ever fly United again. It's been the worst airline experience of my entire life and I've flown hundreds of times.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-14;I have had more then one bad experience with United Airlines. Used United to fly at least 10 times in the last 10 months and almost 8 of those times something has gone wrong - cancelled flights ridiculous charges for flight changes if necessary recently my boyfriend couldn't make his first flight so United was going to cancel his round trip ticket home which meant he had to buy new flights. These are just a few examples.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;I flew UA from New York to LA and had to buy $10 headphones if I wanted to watch the TV. I also booked the flights with my partner and put us seated together and when we printed out our boarding tickets they had moved us so we sat separately on the flight. We then flew from LAX to Sydney Australia. Once again they had separated us. We were extremely annoyed that we had to spend a 14 and a half hour flight sitting in between strangers when we booked to sit together. There was no complimentary alcoholic beverages and the good food always ran out by the time it got towards the end of the plane which a lot of people complained about to the staff. Overall I would never recommend UA to anyone. Splitting up couples and putting single riders between them is a joke and not good enough.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;Travelling from Ottawa to Maui on December the 28/2014 my experience with staff was not pleasant some of them were very rude and impolite. Service was pitiful not picking up garbage. At one point I had to take my own trash to the back of the plane where staff were standing and chatting between themselves. If I can help it I will never travel with this company again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;I used United in the past for domestic flights in the US and it was average I thought it would be fine to use them to travel abroad. Price was the same as any other good or average quality airline. No less. Seat Comfort: average for domestic seat comfort with the disadvantage that there is no pillow blanket or other accessories offered. Food and Beverages: Here the situation started bothering me. The only available food was for sale! The only beverages were water juice and such. Everything else was for sale. Inflight Entertainment: The only provided entertainment was also for sale even to listen to music you had to pay. Staff Service: I guess this varies but it was pretty poor. Some flight attendants were not courteous and shouted at passengers who stood up at awkward times. $1000 USD 6 hrs trip with no entertainment no food (only beverages) rude attendants and semi-domestic flight seats. Moreover since only beverages were served there was a more than 6 people line to use the restrooms at all times for the last 3 hours of the flight. After traveling to Europe and South America for the last two years in different airlines I think this is a very poor service for such a high price. Other airlines give full service for about the same price!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;Flew round trip Houston to Honolulu in Business Class costing over $6000.00. The seats didn't recline enough to sleep comfortably. The foot rest was manual and difficult to operate. The seat was not as wide as a normal business class seat. There was no TV monitor only wifi via the United app and your personal screen device. No one on the flight was aware of needing a personal device on the flight. There were no outlets available to charge a personal device if you had one and the wifi kept going out. The selection of movies was not current. Older movies and TV shows were the only thing available. The meals were awful pasta and sauce and a burrito the return flight had the same offerings other than a pathetic breakfast sandwich with paper thin ham. No amenity kit was offered on the red eye return flight. There was nothing upgraded or business class about this flight. I do not recommend this airline for the trip to Honolulu from Houston.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;"Flight 1252 to LA. Flight started off delayed 20 minutes then out to 40 minutes. Then we boarded and sat for a further 20 minutes. No communication from the staff regarding the delay until the standard 'loading some late luggage"" excuse. Really poor. Flight finally pushed back over an hour late with very little comment from a cabin crew that were largely anonymous. Crew standards are pretty ordinary. Never again with UA.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;What a ridiculous flight. My husband and I had to first had to wait over an hour to check our bags from Colorado to Alaska. Then our flight was over an hour late because of delays loading luggage. We missed our connecting flight and we had to wait in Anchorage with our three month old son for 8 hours. We didn't get a meal voucher or anything. The staff that worked for United told us that we weren't entitled and it was too bad. They gave everyone free movie on the plane but my husbands didn't work. I had already paid for a movie so it didn't matter on my screen. Will not be flying United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;United looks appealing simply because it offers more choice and times. In previous years it has been my first choice. Each time I was hoping the problem was just a fluke. The last 3 United flights all had huge delays and poor handling of the situation. The delay was not reported until after boarding time and passengers were not assisted with missing their connecting flight. Staff were rude and the planes were not very clean. United has grown too big to properly handle itself. If your looking for quality not quantity United is not the airlines to pick any more.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-11;NRT-SFO upper deck B747. Check-in was quick and easy going. Avoiding UA depressing lounge went to ANA one which was not so so better. Wines not good. Food really uneatable (chicken). Desert: high calories ice cream with artificial flavor dressing. All of this to be avoided by healthy persons. Nice IFE but much more limited than on B777. Old seat  but much more comfortable than B777 ANA's.;POSITIVE

united-airlines;2015-01-05;Flew SFO LAX and ICN - SFO in Business as part of a RTW ticket. I continue to see improvement at United. On the short hop to LAX I was in F and the drinks were served in glass as opposed to my last experience when they were in plastic. The FA was friendly and very present. On the transpacific leg I was on the Upper Deck. I continue to really like the UA Business Class seat. It has more positions and the space is well designed. The dinner was quite good - Cioppino - and nicely served. Most US crews lack the energy and enthusiasm that one finds on foreign carriers but the service was friendly and attentive. I have no complaints.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;Paid over $6000 for business class ticket to Honolulu. This is an 8.5 hour flight. Seat was smaller than any other business class seat I've experienced - no recline and very uncomfortable. Meals were worse than usual airline food a sad dish of penne pasta and tomato sauce. Second meal was a burrito wrap! Entertainment was pathetic. No monitor only WiFi which did not offer any new releases and service was sketchy lost connection several times. Staff was average competent but certainly not $6000+ of friendly skies. Will avoid flying this airline if at all possible. So not looking forward to the return trip. Would change plans but united charges $200.00 for any changes.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;"We flew from SYD to LAX in United Airlines Business Class B777 service in December 2014. We were quite pleased with the overall experience. The seats proved to be comfortable in the sitting position. They were a bit too narrow though for comfortable sleeping even for a 5'2"" woman. In comparison my wife stated that her recent Business class long-haul flights on Qantas and Emirates had much better seats for sleeping primarily due to the greater width. She found it very difficult to get to sleep on the United seat although she noted that the United seats were more comfortable in the seated position. The length was felt to be adequate. Storage space was minimal but adequate for our needs. TV screens were very generously sized and of good quality. Food service was excellent in quality as well as the attentiveness of service and friendliness of the staff throughout the flight - deemed to be slightly better than both Qantas and Emirates in that respect. Overall a good experience so perhaps United is making effort (apparently successfully) to improve its quality of service in recent months.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;I flew BFS-EWR on November 3rd and returned December 3rd 2014. United is one of the worst airlines that I've ever travelled with. IFE was broken on both flights the cabin crew were indifferent and some were down right nasty the food was horrible. I will never fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;Flew to Cancun in early December from NYC. To return to NYC we arrived at the airport in Cancun more than 2 hours before flight to find the United service desks in complete chaos. The line to check in stretched the entire length of the airport. No one was sure if they were on the right line as the signage was very confusing. No other airline had such problems. Very stressful and unpleasant. Will not fly United to Cancun again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;I recently returned from a round-trip from Charlotte-Rochester NY with change of planes in Dulles on the outbound and Newark on the inbound. The trip was fine. Flight attendants on all flights were very professional. Ticketing crew in Charlotte and Rochester were nice. I used the lounge in Newark and was pleasantly surprised. Food was limited to snacks but that was to be expected (why US airlines do not have lounges with food selections akin to those of international airlines is beyond me). But two unexpected plusses were the presence of showers (which I did not use) and free alcoholic beverages (albeit of limited varieties). Still the lounge was a pleasant alternative of the hub-bub of Newark. I am a fan of propeller planes and was not disappointed. Both flights in and out of Rochester were on props. I will fly United again.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;The first leg of our flight was substantially delayed so when we landed in Houston there was no time to eat. Had we known that the next leg was also going to be delayed we would have just delayed boarding and grabbed something. From Houston to Aruba the flight attendants were unfriendly and cranky. They began to offer food for purchase only to find that there was only enough food for the first 1/3 of the plane. On this long flight they only came through the cabin once for beverages. A week later found us at the United counter because one member of our group of three had mysteriously been dropped from the reservation. It took over an hour to get United to see the error. Then of course the flight from Aruba to Houston was delayed but at least we didn't have to wait on the plane this time. Flight attendants were at least cordial and offered beverage service twice. They offered food as well but we had learned our lesson and ate in Aruba! Late getting into Houston so had to run (again) to catch our next plane for our final destination. The gold has definitely worn off the United name it's just sad that they have taken Continental (which I used to love to fly) down with them.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;Right now sitting at LAX on the taxi way for 40 minutes waiting for gate to open - ridiculous. This is after 5+ hour flight from Lihue HI. This is very poor management.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2015-01-05;"Hong Kong to Newark in Business Class. Good flight attendant and a very comfortable bed. Unfortunately the Fasten Seatbelt Sign came on at least 8 times during the 14 hour flight and many times for the smallest turbulence which most passengers ignored. However a very loud recorded message came on every time that said ""Ladies and Gentlemen the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign please make sure your seatbelt is securely fastened"". Because of this announcement I could never sleep more than 90 minutes at a time.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;"Every winter United Airlines serves up the same ""we do not care"" service and ""Do not even ask us to care"" as it's simply more than they wish to even dream of fixing. Every winter flights leave Denver for the 30 minute hop into Aspen. Every year some flights may not land safely and the captain turns the plane around and takes the entire group back to Denver despite having three other airports at lower elevations that would place everyone within an hour to 90 minutes by bus or rent a car to Aspen but they make zero effort to make any contingency plan for this regular occurrence year after year. On the flight return to Denver the air hostess nor pilot make any effort to make any arrangements and at the counter upon arrival of course we wait another 30 min for a gate and the pilot answers are weaker than the air hostess. Then they try to pile all of us like cattle at the one service counter where the zig zag line crawls us through to one sour puss to tell you it's an act of God which excuses every lack of genius displayed on a regular basis. Each and every winter. Useless company #1 Award. I only gave them one star because I had to. Grooming is something else too with hair hanging out all over the place.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;"I have been thinking of switching my loyalty from US Airways where I am a Million Miler. I am a mere silver on United but decided to add some miles on a round-trip from JFK to LAX with a return through IAH to get a rare domestic ride on a flat BX seat in the internationally-configured 787. Completed the outbound yesterday in a 1 year old 737-900 with 20 ""first class"" seats. When the FA's started taking meal orders. The FA first goes to a young lady in the seat in front of me and informs her of the two menu choices. He then moves back to my row (4) and asks the woman next to me which she wants. He then looks at me and says he will be back. Then he works the other side of the aisle. He appears to be randomly moving between seats. Finally he gets to me and there is only one choice and he explained they have been instructed to service the FC cabin in order of United priority. In other word the 16 nonrevenue upgrades get their choice compared to the schmuck without a lot of status who used real money (and not a small amount).";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;United has stopped providing complimentary alcohol on international flights. Flight between Asia and US they put us on a plane with no individual TV screen but the sharing overhead projector TV with pre-scheduled movies during a 12-hour flight. On my recent trip I traveled extensively with Cathay Pacific and Singapore which offers first class customer service to all travelers. I originally chose United based on its extensive hubs domestically and internationally expecting better travel planning and experience. With the increasing routes from CX between US London and Asia and the abundant options of good airlines domestically (Southwest JetBlue Virgin) I'd much rather put a little effort to plan my trip than to travel miserably with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;"I was returning into Houston and catching a United flight from Houston to New Orleans. As usual for United they cancelled the last flight into New Orleans for ""maintenance reasons."" Told they could have fixed the problem but would have had to call in a new flight crew and they don't want to spend the money - it's cheaper to book passengers into a hotel. This has now happened to me and close family members no less than five times in the last couple of months. It has become a routine practice with United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;Flew Business class earlier this month Dulles-LAX round-trip. Seats were better than coach but not by much. They recline only a little. Staff on the red-eye back to Dulles served a snack immediately what is the point of that? I just wanted to sleep at midnight! Then they were noisily talking and carrying on throughout the flight with the galley lights on the whole time. No curtain to block light no attempt by them to keep their voices down so people could sleep. On the trip from Dulles to LAX my inflight entertainment system didn't work.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-31;"This was my first transatlantic flight and it was miserable. Being 6'4"" the legroom was not nearly sufficient. Food wasn't worth the calories and lacked all flavor. Staff is indifferent and we left ORD 90 minutes behind schedule. I know it's become cliché to hate on United but it Really is subpar. I've since flown Aer Lingus American Turkish British and KLM over the same route and all were better (American was a tie I'd say).";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;"It's shocking how bad this airline can be. Flying out of Chicago-the United hub-we were delayed 2 hours while maintenance searched for a ""no go"" part to secure the carts in the galley. How such an apparently essential part was unavailable anywhere on the O'Hare property is unbelievable. It was a completely preventable delay and yet we received no apology from the crew.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;Late into Denver switched to Late flight to Chicago but they dropped our names off the seating chart so we all had spread out horrible seats given a motel in Chicago turned out to be a scam (had to pay for motel) because no more final destination flights until next day. Some very nice service but mostly very unfriendly rude horrible service people work for United. On way back same thing. Two hour delay for final destination and had to get another room waiting for guess. Which led us to meet another rude service person in customer service dept. So I will never fly the Un-friendly sky's of United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;I flew United First Class San Francisco to Seattle (Dec 2013) returning Jan 2014. I was appalled at the service or lack of! No food or drink service at all and this was in First Class! Ground crew at Seattle were terribly rude and should not even be employed in the service industry. United is the worst airline I have had the misfortune to travel on!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;"Sat in 24D on an Airbus 320 from Seattle to Newark. This is a standard aisle seat located on the right side of the aircraft just a few rows behind the over-wing exit rows. It is one of what I call the ""back-of-the-bus"" seats featuring the new Slimline Recaro seating. In light of the trend by most of the domestic air carriers to squeeze as many seats/rows as possible into their airplanes the best thing I can say about this seat is that it was adequate in terms of breadth leg space and comfort. If you are 5' 10"" or less in height or a somewhat taller person with short legs you will be able to sit in this seat and still have a couple of inches between your knees and the back of the seat in front of you. In other words you don't have to sit upright and uptight and feel as though you cannot move or are frozen in place. The lumbar support of the seat back is neither better nor worse than any other typical economy/coach-class seat on United Airlines. I do wish that the seat cushion itself was more supportive - it felt soft and thin - perhaps because the density of the foam filler or stuffing material used is lacking. On a long flight this seat may become uncomfortable and cause you to squirm a bit or want to get up and move around. Seat recline has been reduced and I was only able to move/tilt the seat back about two inches. Fortunately for me the middle seat on this flight was empty and that made my specific seat feel less confining and more bearable as I could spread out a bit (likewise for my seatmate in the adjoining window seat of this row). The staff appeared competent and the service itself was decent. The plane appeared relatively clean and well- maintained. Lamentably there was no in-flight entertainment system whatsoever which seems to be the trend on the smaller Airbus and Boeing aircraft operated by United. To reiterate my earlier comment this seat was adequate and tolerable given the trend by the airlines of reducing seat pitch on their aircraft. Stated simply it represents the new standard in air travel for the average passenger traveling on a budget.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;My wife and I travelled first class from Orlando to Newark recently. We were surprised to see there were no PTVs on the plane. When it was time for meal service we were told there was chicken dinner or a salad. We both don't eat chicken so we ordered salads - we were told they were out of salads. Policy for the 12 first class seats - 6 salads and 6 chicken dishes. Out of luck! We had cookies for dinner.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-22;Orlando to Denver to Edmonton - because we had problems printing our boarding passes we went to airport and a courteous member of staff printed off our boarding passes for us. Because of that today we simply walked to security and went through. We only had 1 carry on bag each and one pack sack each. The staff announced that we could take our carry on bag and they put tags on each of them for us and we dropped them off at the circle just as you boarded the plane. Our bags went straight through to Edmonton. Due to technical problems we left about 1/2 hour late but that was ok. Before we got off the staff read off the gate of connecting flights. That saved everyone a whole lot of time. We made it to our next plane - had about 10 minutes and that plane had to wait for our baggage. There were other passengers in our position also The staff were excellent. No food except to buy not staff's fault. No TV's again not staff's fault. The seats were very comfortable.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-18;"Flew IAH-HNL-IAH in First Class on November 20- 24. I have flown this route several times in the last 15 years and since United took over the flying experience has taken a serious nose dive. Since this route is taken by people mostly cashing in frequent flyer miles and there are not that many ""paying"" passengers United has decided that we do not deserve the amenities that are available on other routes. The first class cabin seats are very uncomfortable and are nowhere near the first class seats of other carriers for long haul flights. The plane had no inflight entertainment and there was not any power ports for charging personal devices - and this was not just first class but the entire plane. If there was another direct flight to Hawaii from Houston on another carrier I would take it. Flying to Hawaii on Continental was a fairly good experience the food was good and the seats were comfortable even though they did not fully recline.";NEGATIVE

Overnight accommodation provided in Newark. Return flight from SFO-LHR all London based crew utterly rude and disinterested in the role that they are paid for. 7th flight this year with United only airline that gets me to my final destination. Crew rude when I walked to the back galley to purchase duty free told me it was the busiest hour of the flight as were serving breakfast before landing at Heathrow I only went direct to the galley as message on screen advised 15 minutes remaining to buy duty free. Crew member told me she hated that message and that she would have to come and have a private word with me for purchasing duty free.

Connecting business class flight from Auckland to San Francisco via LA. The first leg was non-stop on Air New Zealand which was excellent and connected in LA to a business class flight to SFO. When we presented our ticket at the United lounge in LA we were refused entry because it was a business class ""domestic"" flight but were offered entry as a guest of another person we had met on our flight from NZ. Sadly the lounge was a worn out mess nothing more than crackers and cheese slices in packets Internet access that was just a bit faster than the old dial up connections - nothing like any of the lounges offered by carriers we had flown elsewhere in the world. On the tired worn plane a minimal offer of chips or cookies and beverages. The worst part is that the personnel seemed tired of being caught between management decisions that have reduced the quality of service to nothing more than a poor commodity and travelers that resent the carrier.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-12-10;I flew with United Airlines to save money but it turned out to be a mistake. I was traveling to Guatemala City from Dallas making a connection in Houston. We boarded the plane then shortly after got off due to a maintenance issue. Not once were we asked if we had a connection flight or explained to how they would help us get to our destination nor did they give us any updates. I had to ask what to do. I was supposed to be at my destination at noon. I arrived at 10.30pm. Similar incident on my return - took me all day. Bad experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-10;PVG-LAX and IAH-LHR. Both flights were very comfortable. Seat and food is good. The only issue with the dreamliner (787) is the lack of proper window blinds. On the flight Shanghai-Los Angeles I was near the window facing south meaning that I always had the sun in front of me. Although the window transparency can be chanced it cannot be completely darkened and this is an issue when you want to sleep.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-10;Flew United from LAX to IAH non-stop on an aged Boeing 737-700. The flight departed 25 minutes late for no apparent reason (no explanation given). Luggage was still being loaded 25 minutes after scheduled departure. Plenty of people that should have gate-checked luggage were wandering the plane looking for overhead bin space with no help from crew. There was no snack pay only food options. Nonetheless the crew was somewhat friendly passing frequently even offering warmed up chocolate chip cookies to some of the kids although some had to share one cookie.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-10;For this 9 hour flight from Houston to Buenos Aires United uses a very old 767-300 with a 2-1-2 configuration in business class. The seats are the old Continental flat-bed seats which are angled ever-so-slightly towards the window. Although it's a flat bed the bed is very narrow and at my 190cm I could not stretch out. Felt like sleeping in a coffin! Also when you have to go to the bathroom it's quite the operation to step over your neighbour without waking them up. The service and food were OK although the plastic champagne flutes and the character-less dull white dinnerware could be improved upon.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-04;GIG-IAH-NRT. I succeeded in sending my luggage directly to NRT. No need to pick it up at IAH and then check it again. Flight 1: GIG check-in staff very nice. Lounge (GOL low cost) very poor and packed. Flat seat 9D very nice. This part of Business class is much more noisy because close to engines. To be avoided at all costs. FA's very pleasant and smiling. Decent food. Poor drinks. Smooth 9 hours flight with constant info form flight deck. Surprising wide choice of IFE On time. Had to go through immigration and security in IAH. Lounge staff very pleasant. Food awful. Alcoholic beverages charged (>US1000 a glass). Fantastic shower and shower staff. Flight 2: Seat 1L. The best seat on board much more space 3 windows Silent. Same aircraft by coincidence. FA rather unpleasant and rude. Take it or leave it. Very bad food. Horrible Champagne. A nice white Bourgogne that ended after 30 min. At 11.50am lunch was completed then believe it or not no food during the next 12 hours! A tray with 2 types of frozen sandwiches was available in a corner self service. United is saving money on a 14 hour flight on food? One hour before landing greasy breakfast. Luggage quickly delivered.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-04;I may be done with United. Have had gold or platinum status for years but am getting increasingly concerned with linking flying to shopping and spending more money. As much as I hate to give up the three bags the comfortable lounges in airports it is becoming too stressful to keep up. I have almost lost respect for the airlines. Shop till you drop seems to be the key here. We are losing miles we have to spend more shop more buy the credit card. No other alliance does what United does.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-04;First off let me preface that I am not a frequent flyer so I tend to give airlines the benefit of the doubt if there is ever any problems. In the past 6 months I have flown two round trips with United one was non-stop and the other had 1 connecting flight. Every single one of those flights were delayed by an average of 2 hours. I would understand if there were weather conditions that cannot be foreseen but all the delays happened in Florida and California both of which had great weather. I even signed up for text alerts to get notified of these things and my alerts either came in an hour before the scheduled departure flights or never came I'm at all. That defeats the purpose of the alerts because you should to be at the airport about 2 hours prior to your flight. When I went to ask the staff at the counter at the airport they all seemed clueless and was not able to help me alleviate my concerns at all. Some were even downright rude and short with me. These inconveniences have almost cost me to be stranded at the airport because those my friends and family were not able to pick me up. I am more than furious at the less than poor customer service that United has to offer. I've spent hundreds probably even thousand of dollars to travel with this airline but I've failed to receive the proper service and professionalism from their staff and company overall. It is sad to say but I will not be flying with United Airlines anytime again soon. I would rather pay a bit more for other airlines just to ensure that I will receive the kind of service that I should be receiving as a customer.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;United 1064 on November 25 from Newark to Boston. I think United must go out of their way to design a seat as pathetic as is in row 32 on their 737-700. These are narrow don't recline and have no legroom. I travel a lot on business. Luckily I generally have a choice in airlines and I wont be choosing United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;Flew Business class between Australia and California (Sydney to San Francisco and LA to Melbourne). It was my first time flying Business class as I normally fly Economy or Premium Economy and as such I was looking forward to it. Overall I was very disappointed: food was average toilets were dirty and did not appear to have been cleaned difficult to get the staff's attention staff not willing to smile even when I was smiling at them meal service was disjointed (on one flight they offered a bread roll and some wine after I had finished my main course on the other flight they took my glass away for a refill and didn't bring it back) and the staff kept on bumping me when they walked past. The only good thing was the beds lie flat but otherwise I was very disappointed and I found that the Premium Economy on other airlines is much better (such as Qantas Virgin or Singapore). I will not waste my money on United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;I took a United flight from GRU (Sao Paulo) - IAD (Washington DC) in Business First. When I first came to the airport I saw the flight would be delayed for 5-10 minutes. The flight time was originally 12.05 am but because of the delay it was supposed to depart at 12.15 am. So it was ok. But then after I board the flight does not leave until 12.40 am because they were waiting for passengers to board so obviously some passengers were late. In Air the flight crew was nice but they seemed like old United flight attendants to me. So they seemed a little cold to me. But the flight was good and I slept for 4 hours out of the 8 hours. I was glad the flight attendants gave my son the executive dining with out him asking. But the flight entertainment was ok. So it was an ok flight and it was better than the average United flight.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;I did my first transatlantic travel with UA premium economy on 11/15/2014 IAH-MUC 767-400ER. Plane was clean entertainment systems fully functioning great service onboard. Food was a bit underwhelming but it's economy so not much can be added there. Beverage carts made fairly frequent trips. Crew did a good job.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;"Don't pay extra for business on United. We just flew United from Vancouver to Oahu via San Francisco and are now on our way back. We paid the extra for business class - the ""breakfast"" on our first flight consisted of a scone. On a 6 am flight you don't exactly have a chance to grab a bite before departure. There was WiFi on this flight and it had personal TVs which are better than nothing but not quite up to what we are used to with Air Canada. We barely made our connection in SFO - our bags were not so lucky. The next flight had personal TVs but no Wifi. The latter would have been really useful on the long flight. At least we finally got breakfast. The flight crew was inattentive on both flights. On the way home the long haul flight back to the mainland did not have personal TVs or overhead screens but it had WiFi! That was great for as long as my laptop battery lasted but alas the old seats had no power outlets or USBs so my joy was short-lived. Both of our seats were not capable of staying in the upright position and would slowly recline. We chose United over Air Canada as we didn't want an overnight flight home. Next time we will go direct with WestJet and cram into their tiny seats in exchange for a direct flight that operates at a convenient time. We wish Air Canada would put back their daytime flight home. In summary - service and amenities on United are inconsistent even in United First. Even when they are at the top of their game it's all pretty marginal.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-12-01;Horrible customer service at SFO. United flight was delayed into SFO from Vancouver so I missed my connecting flight to San Diego. We got into SFO at 11.50. I am still waiting in line with similar stranded passengers at the customer service area at gate 82 where there are two attendants helping 100 plus people. The attendants at the gates will not help us even though there is no line. This is deplorable. SFO is a United hub. There are United employees and gate attendants everywhere and yet there are only two people willing to help all these stranded passengers. I have been stranded many times with many other airlines and have never had such poor service. I will never fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;HKG-SFO. I've always loved the 747 for its speed and comfort. Nevertheless a 12 hour flight is always a daunting experience but I am happy to say that this flight was wonderful. The multinational staff exceeded themselves and the food was of a standard I was not expecting. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed the flight I even got 6 hours sleep too. Good job United and thank you for the pleasurable experience!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;IAD-LAX. Paid full fare First Class only to be shocked upon check in at IAD airport that my selected seat was not confirmed. Though UA ground staff at check in counter were quite helpful they couldn't do anything except asking me to go to boarding gate and wait the problem to be resolved there. I was told UA does overbooking in all classes. I was looking forward to this flight enroute in First Class as I was connecting to BKK hence I wanted to relax. Alas I wasn't able to relax as I had to ask UA team for every 10 minutes for an update. Finally after a long argument with the gate staff I was given a a First Class seat by an arrogant lady who made one feel that she did me a great favor although it was within my right. Nothing special on this full B737-800 flight. Seat was ok with in-seat video but can't recline much. Having been at Jetblue Mint previously ones can't help but compare the value vs benefits.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;Just flew DEN-LAX-MEL and return SYD-LAX-DEN. I was apprehensive about spending 16+ hours with United internationally as I avoid US carriers for long flights due to overall poor service I was however pleasantly surprised. All flights left on time with early arrivals. Outbound flight was on new 787-9 aircraft was great and seats in Business very comfortable. Entertainment with wide variety and crew were splendid on this run (old CO crew)- very chatty and went above and beyond for passengers. Return flight the same though crew a little older/colder (UA crew). 777 on return was 2-4-2 in Business which is a little ridiculous but seats were all fully flat. Where United is not up to par is inflight catering- food almost inedible on both routes- wines good though.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;EWR-MEX-EWR. Flights operated with early arrival in both directions. Super friendly on-board staff and top-notch gate people who are all an asset to the United team at both the EWR and MEX stations. The in-seat TV ads come on to annoy you even if you've turned the TV off. I felt like they should be paying me for constantly having to turn it off.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;Stockholm to San Francisco USA October 8th. The first plane with Lufthansa from Stockholm to Frankfurt on October 8 was OK. The plane from Frankfurt UA 927 to San Francisco did not start at all and we were all transported to a hotel. The next day October 9 after much waiting I was rebooked to Chicago UA 906 with further connection there. This plane did not start either. Waited on the plane for six hours before it finally left so I missed my connection. A few hours rest and back to the airport in the early morning on October 10. I got the flight to San Francisco nearly two days later than was scheduled.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;I travelled with United for the first time last week. I was travelling business class and was a little apprehensive. The staff were fantastic very friendly and welcoming. The food was also very good - on both legs (from Melbourne to LAX). The flat beds extremely comfortable with very soft pillows. Not as many frills and extras as other airlines business class but if you can afford this for a long haul flight - the legroom and ability to stretch and sleep is worth it.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;Last week flew ORD-IAH-TYR/SHV-IAH-FLL-IAH-ORD in a mix of 737-900 (updated interior - great) EMB-135 and A319. All mainline jets were in Econ Plus or Emergency Row so leg-room was great. Most flights on-time and service was good. It's so hit and miss with UA as one flight had great service and the next mainline flight was bitter flight attendants. Regional flights were good - flight attendants had personality and very friendly service. Entertainment on some flights and others nothing but a shared screen with a movie released a year ago. Other than the IAH-ORD flight all on-time. Fare was decent so overall a good trip. With UA's new requirements for miles flown and price paid I won't get Gold Status next year and that will reduce my flying with them more than this year.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-20;BOS-LAX Boeing 757: Had booked Premium Economy for two people 6 months ahead arrived at check-in in BOS to be told by unhelpful and off-hand staff that 'booking not assured until you check-in' allocated economy for the 6 hour flight and money refunded. Excuse of 'change of equipment' from A319 to 757 not tenable as latter has even more Premium Economy seats. On arriving at gate discover that Premium Economy seats are available but now have to pay an extra $36! Customer service in United completely unrepentant of being asked to pay extra for the distress. Actual seats fine but would not recommend using United for Premium Economy on the basis of this experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-17;UA 28 / UA 940 - London LHR / Newark Liberty EWR return. Outbound flight with refitted B777. Enough entertainment friendly helpful staff simple food nice overall. Inbound flight very old B767 but clean cabin and cheerful helpful staff. I was quite surprised by this quality actually as I frequently hear bad rumours about flying experience with United. Well done.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-17;LHR/EWR/LHR. B757 out and B767 return. Outward flight was just OK. Inflight entertainment was good and the seat fairly comfortable. The big let down was the crew. They were efficient but showed no personality at all and I did not see a single smile from them. The return flight was disappointing. The entertainment system offered very little choice was shown on tiny screens and from what I could see quite a few screens including mine were broken or were only showing half a picture. Again the crew were robotic with no personality at all and although efficient they seemed totally disinterested. Unlike other airlines on the route who offer a free bar only soft drinks are free on United. All in all United seem to be offering a budget almost 'No Frills' service but at the same price as other transatlantic carriers who offer a far better experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-12;I have flew twice from Denver to Winnipeg in the last month and both times they say that food is offered for you to purchase and both times they had absolutely nothing to offer. I boarded these flights thinking that at least I can buy something onboard as I did not have time to purchase something in the airport! I was not impressed to say the least.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-12;LAX-NRT-SIN. First leg was good on the 787. Food was mediocre and made me appreciate Delta and question myself why i wasn't flying DL that was leaving an hour later out of LAX and Staff basically disappeared between services. The seat was comfortable at least the IFE was not as good as DL due to the smaller choice of movies. NRT-SIN was on a 772. The crew also disappeared after the meal service (which was also mediocre). My sister and I had our seats moved without being told but we weren't complaining.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-12;I have been flying United for the past 6 years from MAN to EWR and to my dismay it is a total and utter shambles. Within those 6 years I have flown as a solo passenger whilst being pregnant and then with an infant and later with a toddler. I would not recommend them to a single traveler let alone a pregnant one. The only reason we continued to use this airline was due to the fact that EWR has the most quickest and convenient route home. Apart from that there is nothing that is appealing about the airline. The seats are not the slightest bit comfortable however you are able to slightly move them back to a tilt. I can disregard the seating as almost all airlines are the same but the cabin crew were obnoxious rude and definitely did not seem to enjoy their job. Asking for juice was definitely a chore for them. Next time I will not be flying United too many years of bad experiences.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-12;LHR to LAX return during October 2014. Check-in unavailable on-line and at auto machine at LHR. Had to join queue despite having carry-on bags only. Outbound flight during daylight. Seat fine. Meal average to poor. Headphones fairly useless making it difficult to watch movies etc. Staff good. Return flight overnight complete contrast. Staff polite but charmless. No drinks unless you pay. ie wine $8.99 glass. Food poor. Both flights on time and at £60 less than BA basic but fairly acceptable.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-12;"Flew from BOM-EWR. Fairly full flight. Unfortunately I was seated next to an already drunk passenger. Crew (very observant) discreetely intervened and rectified my problem in 2 minutes flat. I was seated aisle side with an empty middle seat (rare treat indeed). My go to drink on United is the premium red wine (Meiomi Pinot Noir) a solid value (70% premium over store price compared to the 500% premium on beers and booze - only the stupid pays $8 for Johnny Red). Unfortunately they were not carrying it on the flight. The super helpful nice lady comped me with 2 bottles of house red with my dinner andthen brought me a big wine glass (yes a glass and not the flimsy plastic cup) wfull of amazing cab - from the front! andshe brought it one more time before ""bedtime"". I was floored by the attentive service of the united flight crew. Hope my relationship with United will continue to thrive.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-11;London to Orlando via Washington. Terminal 2 fab help at self serve kiosks swift bag drop and security. Boarding efficient. 777-200 comfortable in aisle seat. Inflight service excellent plenty of soft drink runs expected charge for alcohol so had card with me. 3 choices for dinner lovely green Thai chicken curry with salad and some type of apple cake. FA's disengaged and going through the motions but professional no extra touches here. However clean cabin and toilets blanket pillow and headphones on all seats on boarding. Inflight entertainment choices very good. Arrived on time connection in Washington smooth. Crew on 2nd flight less interested but so was I by this point! Was just so relieved to be on this aircraft ad not some of the older smaller jets UA are still using on transatlantic routes.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-06;Flew EWR-HNL-EWR on Oct 24 2014 and returning on Oct 31 2014. The crew on EWR-HNL was quite good. They sure let passengers know that the food available for purchase would be available during entire duration of the flight and all we had to do was come back to the galley. Very important on a long flight with no meal service. They also made sure to go through the aisles with water repeatedly. The crew on the return flight from HNL- EWR left much to be desired.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-06;My flight was 2 hours late from MSP to EWR and so I was going to miss my connecting Etihad flight to Mumbai. However the ground staff at MSP were very helpful and booked me on a direct United EWR to BOM flight that was scheduled just an hour later than my original flight. However my good experience stopped there. The premium economy seats were terrible. Not enough leg space and the head support wings were not adjustable vertically which meant anyone shorter than 5 feet 8 inches could not use them. Second there was no complementary alcohol (not even a glass of red wine) available on the 14 hour flight. I was mentally prepared for their standards but was still let down. On top of which I could pay only by credit card for a drink. Considering I was a Indian tourist the likelihood of me doing this was very low. The food was terrible and both the veg/non veg meals were almost inedible. The air hostesses were not friendly and avoided eye contact. They seemed very put upon by their job. I don't blame them as they probably had to eat the same food as us. I would never ever book this airline voluntarily.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-03;IAH to DXB via IAD IAD to DXB 5 hours late no help from ground staff I thought that their rules about lengthy delays evidently not on United sat in first class lounge for 7 hours. I have never seen such a pathetic excuse for a lounge the snacks were questionable and the whole lounge is out dated and appears dirty. Cabin staff were clearly annoyed by the delay imagine I paid for this my seat area was sticky and dirty flight attendant was un co-operative when I asked her to clean it. I was never once addressed by my name the crew clearly thought that they were doing me a favour by even being on the flight. Food was worse than I've ever seen even for a United flight. Fortunately I took my own food we were told Restroom was reserved for crew so the 2 restrooms for business class had to serve first class. All food was prepared by bare hands and galley person eat food as she prepared it also sneezed and even scratched her head whilst preparing food. Other airlines offer pre packed nuts etc. considering the choice of other airlines that fly from the US to UAE United is way behind. Looking at Emirates lounge in Dubai or BA lounge in London puts United at the back of the line. I did arrive in Dubai and so did my luggage but the trip was far from first class and worse still some of the original crew were on my return flight and still equally annoyed by having to perform their duties. Cabin staff are obviously disgruntled and it shows I wonder what happened to the old continental crews because before the merger continental really wasn't that bad as airlines go. Today's first class on United is not even as good as the old business first on continental. Worse still one of our group who had suffered 15 hours from Dubai to IAD was down graded from IAD to IAH because of over booking. I've learnt my lesson never again with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-03;"Having spent the last 7 weeks travelling around the world business class with various airlines we were very excited about our business first class flights firstly Honolulu to San Francisco and then Newark to Edinburgh on our journey home. The disappointment started with entry to the lounge on both occasions where no substantial food was offered. Carrots by the truck load and processed cheese on the tiniest crackers did not appeal so we had no option but to head back out to a food retailer for a sandwich at further expense (having spent £6000 on tickets already for this allegedly upgraded service). Liquid refreshments are limited with my husband being charged for a third drink when I had not even had one! It would appear that United Airlines Cabin Crew Bar Staff and Club reception staff attend regular classes in being curt disinterested or just plain rude! Thankfully waiting staff etc do not and are very pleasant. Regarding the plane itself on both occasions these were very obviously old and incredibly uncomfortable. Sitting in row 2 on both flights subjected we were subjected to cabin crew slamming doors continuously chatting very loudly or witness several members chomping on food whilst preparing the passengers meagre offerings.

The 4 hour flight had no video the seats were poor and there was no meal only a snack box! While I'm sure that this saved United Airlines money I describe it as a bait and switch. I paid the extra for First Class and didn't get what I had paid for.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-11-03;Flew UA from DEN to HNL in First Class. This is apparently a converted Continental plane with full reclining seats in first class. The seat was very comfortable with plenty of room. The food was decent although the spinach calzone was drowned in a cream sauce - tasty but not very healthy. The servers were friendly and helpful although after the meal was served about an hour in you had to make a request for a beverage over the next 5 hours as opposed to any regular beverage service. I rarely fly first class so maybe they expect you to ask for something as opposed to bringing beverages out regularly? The plane had seatback on-demand entertainment which was great except why is it that the UA webpage is still showing their listings for September and October only?;POSITIVE

Found cabin staff both helpful and friendly helping passengers with difficulties in placing on board luggage this was more a problem on the domestic legs probably because people try to avoid checking in luggage and therefore push the limits with carry ons I note that some Aussie domestic airlines are cracking down on this so perhaps other airlines will follow. Anyhow just wanted to relay my positive experience with United and would recommend them for a good service at good price. Loved the ""Dreamliner"" on the return flight!";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2014-10-31;Our travel agent booked our flights within the USA from Australia. Each leg was on United Airlines.

united-airlines;2014-10-31;"RT Kona Hawaii to London Heathrow. The flight from London to San Francisco is about 11 hours non-stop. I am a 6'3"" disabled and booked my flight with that disclosure. To accommodate me the agent made an effort to place me in a seat which had an empty seat beside me - very considerate and appreciated. At Heathrow prior to boarding I was called to the podium. To accommodate a family so that they might sit together I was told (not asked if I minded) I was being moved to a different seat and unbeknownst to me in a three-abreast row without an empty seat beside me. Now I know that United felt the priority of placing a family together takes precedent over my disabled status and assuming a full flight I can understand that priority. This particular flight however was about 90% filled. Many empty seats were available. I know that having an empty seat beside me is not a right or entitlement as a disabled person yet was a kindness extended to me by the reservations agent a kindness for which I was very grateful. UAL has a policy in place to help accommodate and make more comfortable disabled veterans whenever they can. I am pleased with that policy. I am just disappointed with what happened on that flight. Additionally and as mentioned in previous reviews a 737 is far to small an aircraft for the flight from Kona to San Francisco without increasing the pitch and width of the seats. Years ago United was known as an airline that cared. It made for comfortable travel travel to which I looked forward. In summary in the future I will make a sincere effort to travel with an airline other than United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-31;Since the late 80's I have been flying UA for business and pleasure and it has been a roller coaster ride. Having switched to another carrier for the last couple of years due to truly awful reliability and missing customer meetings I thought I would give UA another chance on a trip from Denver to Paris. How hard could it be? Get on the DEN-ORD flight allowing 2.5 hours in ORD to make the transfer to the ORD-CDG flight. The trip occurred 10 days after the control center fire and calls to UA customer service a couple of days prior to our trip confirmed things were working well again in ORD. The origin flight in DEN was the continuation of a SEA-DEN leg and that plane arrived right on time. The departure for ORD showed on time so we went to the gate to find another on time message on the board. Boarding time came and went with a last minute 15 minute delay. No problem I thought we had plenty of time in ORD. Soon another delay showed up on the gate monitor now we were 30 minutes late should I be worried? How much worse could it get and where was the Seattle aircraft that had made it to Denver on time? Soon another delay with the bottom line of just over an hour. Finally we boarded and pushed back and sat and sat and sat for another 15 minutes when a mechanical problem was announced. At this point it was clear we would miss the Paris connection and we went to the long lines at Customer Service to see what we could do. UA moved us to the later Lufthansa Frankfurt non-stop with CDG connection and said they would transfer our bags. (Of course no bags the next morning in CDG and UA blamed it on Lufthansa). Bags showed up 3 days later and we found out that UA sent them to ORD on a later flight. All this is very sad as the customer service people are trying hard to make their system work but are hamstrung by continued incompetent management. Once again we are riding the competition who are not perfect but much better than UA.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;2014 Platinum flyer and 1M United Flyer. Flew last night on UA Flight 1430 between Orange County CA and Chicago O'hare. Seated in center of 8th row. 1 row off bulkhead. About an hour before the landing the flight attendants came through with another beverage service. After they had passed I asked my row mates to let me out to use the rest room. The isle to the rear of the plane was blocked by the cart. I proceeded forward to the forward rest room where I was stopped by the male flight attendant serving first class. He indicated that I needed to return to coach and to the rear of the plane to use those restrooms. I indicated to him that the aisle was filled with the cart and the forward restroom was the only one I could get to. He again indicated to me to return to the rear of the plane. I told him I would not and proceeded by him and used the rest room. Behind me was my row mate (first met him on the plane) who is a 2014 1K member. The flight attendant told him he could not use the rest room also he proceeded by him too. All the while other customers are watching this flight attendant act like the Potty Police interrogating passengers about their restroom needs. Unprofessional and ridiculous. Happens all the time.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;October 10 LIS-EWR. After arrival at our departure gate I thought I was at a wrong one after looking at the aircraft parked at the gate. To my astonishment I was about to make an 8-hour transcontinental flight on an ancient Boeing 737-200 whose regular use in domestic routes was phased out in 2008. United wouldn't be United without some kind of delay so there was a 30-minute hold. The flight was relatively smooth. Staff appeared to be seasoned but lacking courteousness with one having a condescending attitude and curt tone. Meals were hardly edible - I would say they were the worst of many kinds I have had. Overall I rate my experience with United below average and will try to avoid my future journeys with this airline.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;"I was horribly dissatisfied with my experience using United Airlines. I was traveling to the states for Thanksgiving weekend and was delayed 3 hours on my first flight due to ""late inbound aircraft"" and again for my connecting flight another 2 hours due to the same reason. Looking back the last 4 times I have traveled with United this has been the reason. There was no weather leaving Montreal or Chicago. Then again on my return flight I was delayed 2.5 hours and 4 hours on my connecting flight. When I finally got to my final destination at 2 am after 12 hours of traveling which should have taken a total of 6 I waited 45 minutes for my checked luggage. When I asked why we were waiting for so long the United representative told me there were two flights coming in from Chicago and they wanted to put the luggage out all at the same time. I've never heard of this happening and several other passengers and I thought this was unreasonable. Our flight landed several hours late why should we have to wait even longer for another flight to land deplane and unload their baggage. I will avoid flying with United again simply because they did nothing but say ""sorry"" and essentially ruined what would have been a very enjoyable weekend with my family.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;Went ORD-DCA-ORD overall flights were okay although both were delayed. On my outbound flight there was also a delay because of a seat being broken on the aircraft and subsequently it seemed the flight was either overbooked or not completely ready to depart by the scheduled time due to some confusion with seating arrangements.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;Sat waiting for maintenance and cleaning crews for over an hour. Sat in hot plane for all that time. More ground crew accountability is badly needed.

united-airlines;2014-10-28;"We were traveling Business class from Newark to Las Vegas on Sept 26th. Apparently the definition of Business class offered by United differs from any other airline out there. When traveling economy I normally bring my own bottle of water and buy some food in the airport. This time given that I had paid 3 times as much for a Business class ticket and also remembering what it means worldwide I did not bring anything of my own. What a mistake! When I asked for a glass of water while plane was still boarding an extremely rude flight attendant asked me: ""Do you really want it now?"". Again United definition of a Business class does not include providing enough food for everyone. I have never encounter such unprofessional behavior in any service industry - and air travel belongs to a service industry last time I checked. In Business class provided by United you are paying for some extra leg room and nothing more. I will never fly this airline again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;"SFO-HKG-SGN-HKG-SFO in Economy Plus. The B744 to and from Hong Kong was clean and well-maintained but showing its age-especially in the lack of IFE. However in both directions the crews were very good with lots of passenger interaction and presence in the cabin. They were HK based and very international in composition. The crews to/from SGN were even better-old Continental Mic staff based in Guam. I had exit row seats on all legs and found the legroom to be fine and the seat OK--but on such long segments no seat in economy is really ""comfortable"". The food was OK-could have been better with just a few additional touches-but no real complaints. The lounge in HK is fantastic-head and shoulders above anything in the US which made for a nice interlude. Overall an acceptable performance.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-28;IAD-SAV-IAD 29 Sept to Savannah and 13 Oct return to Washington Dulles. We have used United Express on their small Embraer and CRJ200 Aircraft many times before when flying to Savannah from Newark Chicago Washington etc. Always been perfectly OK and usually on time and surprisingly comfortable. No IFE supplied and no refreshments purchased but then again they are only short flights. But this time having booked our flights we were offered Economy Plus seats when we came to choose our seats for $28 each per flight. We duly chose this option and paid only for the aircraft on the outward flight to be changed. The replacement aircraft had no Economy Plus seats - no refund came until I chased this through there refund system. Worse still the return flight was on the original aircraft which never had Economy Plus seats in the first place.

united-airlines;2014-10-20;Not a good experience flying first class from Seattle to Charlotte. On second leg there wasn't any first class on the plane and they didn't put my wife and myself together. Very frustrating. I did demand a refund and they did accommodate. Flying back from Charlotte they couldn't get my wife and Myself together in first class. Very frustrating. They didn't even try to fix that one. Customer service from United is questionable. They act like they just don't care.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-20;01/10/2014. LHR-IAH. Flight UA5. IAH-GIG UA129. A journey I upgraded from economy to business first using a global premier upgrade a free perk obtained as a IK level frequent flyer. I feel that the level of service on United has improved drastically and the efforts of front line personnel should be recognised. The flight attendants on UA5 from Heathrow to Houston were superb. They provided very professional prompt and friendly service. A comfortable seat in a new Boeing 787. In fact throughout all including my return journey from Rio via Houston and Chicago all check in and flight personnel were considerate and attentive. All flights arrived on schedule or early. I would also add that as a United flyer since 1995 my baggage has never been lost! From what I can see the only service problems this company ever had are being corrected. If these improvements continue I suggest that United could indeed become a world class leader.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-20;"We recently flew from Cairns to Guam to Kwajalein on United Airlines. Although mainland US airlines have a bad name for treatment of their passengers - the Micronesia service transcends this. There were a number of aspects about this flight which were worrying. At Cairns the demeanour of the check-in staff was very ""in your face"" - when we asked to speak to the supervisor - this only made things worse. Documentation is a ""very touchy"" aspect of booking in for any US airline these days. Even though we had our ESTA validation application in hard copy to show they basically refused to believe we had a valid ESTA as they were having trouble accessing the data on their computer. This was even though we had our ESTA forms identical to our passports! Take a hard copy of the website baggage guidelines - they make it up as they go! When we finally got in the air - the food is poor. Be prepared for some serious security scanning in Kwajalein as it is a closed airport unless you have a sponsor or travelling to Ebeye - Passport photocopied ESTA examined separate Sponsor documentation retinal scanning height weight finger printing and questioning. If another airline elects to service this route I would certainly look to avoid UA.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-13;I flew from Manchester Airport and was flying to Newark then had a connection flight to Rochester. As soon as I checked in I was told they had overbooked and asked us to fly to London first. I explained that we had a connection flight to Rochester and we were attending my nephews wedding so couldn't have any delays. We were then told there was no seats on the Rochester flight. After a lot of arguing they got us on the 1st flight to Newark and then found us flights on the Rochester flight but the 4 of us would not be seated together. I had 2 children with us and was not happy but just pleased to get the flights. Coming home we were delayed 3 times from Rochester. Our connection flight from Newark was boarding at 6.30pm we got off our flight from Rochester at 7.05pm and had to run for 10 minutes to catch the flight my daughter has asthma and struggled however we just made the flight.

united-airlines;2014-10-13;Flew Oct 6th LAS-ORD on an ancient B-757. Like a trip back in history albeit not a good one! No idea why United still flies these ancient planes with pretty much original interior from the 80's. Chose Premium economy as it was 35h flight 79$ for this was just a scam pretty much. Got 5 extra inches leg room and that's it. Would have been nice with at least a free sandwich or whatever. Guess US carriers are still years behind European and Asian one's. Why not just call it what it is extra leg room seats? Spent 3h playing on the phone as United appears to address their customers as idiots as this was a morning flight with mostly business passengers yet still playing a cartoon movie on the overhead monitors. Talk about missing your target. Several items on the menu also ran out was sitting on row 2 so guess they just dont care to stock up on items guess what United that's another way to miss income from your passengers.

united-airlines;2014-10-13;Travelled on a connecting flight from Toronto to Houston TX en route to Rio de Janeiro. Flight from Toronto was inexplicably delayed. Upon arrival in Houston taxied to the gate only to find another plane at the assigned gate. Had to re-taxi to another gate arriving 5 minutes before scheduled departure to Rio de Janeiro. In spite of pleas from more than half the passengers regarding connecting flights flight attendants stated it was out of their control to deal with. Upon deplanning the Customer Service representative appeared over-whelmed with the situation and was of no assistance other than to direct all connecting passengers to the Customer Service Desk in Concourse C. The representative at the desk was of little assistance other than booking us on the next evening flight with non-adjacent seat assignments. Was not provided with the Premier Boarding package that I had booked and paid for in advance. We were told that we would not have access to our luggage and we were offered accommodations at a sub-par hotel chain which we declined. Also offered two $7 meal vouchers for a 24 hour period (which I also declined). Upon arrival the next evening gate staff were less than courteous. Certainly such delays occur when flying however the issue of not holding connecting flights when some 40 passengers are affected is not acceptable. This is especially true when arriving at or very near the scheduled departure time of the connecting flights and considering that such connection times are offered by the airline. Enhanced public relations by United staff would also go a long way in appeasing disgruntled passengers. That being said the regional jet from Toronto to Houston was new and very roomy. The premium economy seats on the B777 was also comfortable.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-13;Just completed a series of three flights back to back. The flight attendants and all other aspects of the flight were passable but with that said that's as far as it seems to go. United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic. At the end of the day United may not be my first choice but it gets me there.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-08;Friday 26 Sep 2014 my wife and I went to BTV for what we thought were two legs of a flight on United Airlines that would get us into SFO at 12.40 PT. We actually arrived at approximately 02.30 PT on Saturday about 14 hours late. Part of the delay was caused by someone starting a fire in the FAA control tower at ORD. I have no complaints with United about that. My complaint with United is its total lack of communication on that Friday and on the return the following Friday. On the first leg from BTV to ORD United kept telling us we had to wait an hour. We could not leave we had to sit there with no information hour by hour from 07.00 to 16.00. The only thing we were told was our connections would be okay because they could not fly either. United even put us on the plane and pulled away from the gate at about 12.30. Then they brought us back to the gate and had us deplane and wait some more. Finally we left at about 16.00 and got to ORD expecting to get on the flight to SFO we were told was waiting. Imagine our surprise and anger to find the flight had left hours before. We were told we would have to stay the night in Chicago at our expense and leave in the morning! When I asked what about getting on the SFO flight the customer service person said it was fully booked and had a wait list. When I pushed the agent did put us on the wait list. One piece of luck we got on the plane. It was late enough that other people did not show. We spent the week in SFO and went to the airport in plenty of time. We had checked in for the return flight when we checked in for the outbound flight online. We went to the kiosk to check-in and there was no reservation. The agent at SFO was able to get us on the plane somehow so we relaxed again almost as much as we were when we went to the airport. Then she hit us with an unwarranted baggage charge. It was unwarranted because we used a United MileagePlus card for the flight. Despite realizing we had not been charged for the bags on the way out to SFO she would not believe us they should not be charged for. When we got to ORD we discovered our flight to BTV was not our originally scheduled 3 hour layover but an 8 hour layover. Again there was no communication from the SFO agent to us about changing our second leg it was just done. After a lot of talking we got onto our originally scheduled flight and got home on schedule.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-08;We had a great experience with United Airlines on our return flight from Ottawa (Canada) to Phoenix connecting through Chicago O'Hare. Our flight to Phoenix was smooth and on time. The only thing missing was inflight entertainment. Our return flight was complicated by the fact that a disgruntled employee set a fire to a centre governing the flights through both Chicago airports on the Friday before our Sunday departure. We called the United 1-800 number and got through to an agent quite quickly. She was extremely helpful and could not find us an alternate flight with United so arranged for us to take a flight from Phoenix to Philadelphia and Philadelphia to Ottawa with US airways. We departed and arrived at a very similar flight to our original flight with United. This was the best service that I have ever received in a difficult situation like this. We had a very tight connection on the way back and our baggage arrived on the flight with us. Good job United!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;I recently traveled from Arkansas where I was visiting my family back to Honolulu HI where I am currently stationed in the US Air Force. On the last flight as I was boarding I was informed that my seat had been moved. When booking the flight I paid extra to have an exit row aisle seat because I have bad knees and needed the extra leg room. I was instead placed in the middle seat of a non exit row. The staff made no explanation regarding my seat change did not offer their apologies and did not seem to have any concern over the money I had lost paying for a seat that I did not end up having. I am extremely frustrated with this service and will encourage all of my friends to fly with a different airline. This kind of treatment is unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;First class sure isn't what it used to be. On a round trip from Dulles to Vegas both times they ran out of cereal before they took my breakfast order so all they had to offer were some nasty eggs broccoli casserole and dried out croissants. Apparently they only stock enough cereal for 1/2 of first class? Really? For a $1378 ticket I want my freaking cereal not food poisoning. The clincher was that they charge first class passengers for wi-fi access. They should be ashamed. Only a half notch above economy if that much.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;SYD-SFO-SYD: Flew in late September. I got the same plane for both legs of the journey which looks rather old. There appears to be more Economy Plus seats than Economy seats. Plane had a dodgy IFE for the entire section of seats I was seating. My own AVOD was jammed and could not be reset. Food was barely edible for dinner but it got better for breakfast and drinks were forthcoming. Legroom was okay. From the US leg I had to use the kiosk to check in but it refused to print my ticket and required a staff to assist me. I was disappointed with quality of the airline overall because I would have expected US-based airlines to have a superior standard. If you are flying on a budget this may be for you but otherwise you might want to look elsewhere.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;Our flight from Boston to Denver was delayed by an hour. We approached the service desk in Boston when notified about the delay because we had a very short layover on our way to Seattle. We were told all connecting flights would be fine and that they would make up the time in the air. It wasn't until we were almost to Denver that they bothered to inform us of the added time to the flight and we arrived just in time to see our next plane depart. They did put us up in a hotel for free and got us on the next flight out the next morning only to have that plane stop mid-takeoff due to a plane malfunction. If the staff had been gracious and accommodating during this nightmare it might not have been so bad but they had the nerve to tell us it was our fault for not having a longer layover (as if we had a choice). Never flying with United again if we ever get back to Seattle.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;SFO-LAS short flight on a 737 - flight departed about 25mins late arrived a bit late seats comfortable for a short flight. The flight did what it said on the tin. However in my years of flying I've seen nothing like it! Onboard no crew at the door sat down and noticed people across from me put three large bags by their feet and then put tray tables down to cover them. Crew failed to spot this on a few occasions but eventually did ask 'can you put your tray table up' walked away before they seeing the bags. Crew served drinks by just looking at you no thank you no hello nothing! The flight had a free gift of cards given out - thrown at you of course. On leaving the flight the crew were at the front chatting. First time I've flown United is the last based on crew attitude - no smile no communication.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;Flew from Tucson AZ to Kona HI today. Horrible trip!. In Tucson the ticket agents argued and snapped at each other in front of the customers. The Tucson-LAX portion was fine the flight attendant was very professional and as I was traveling with a handicapped companion she was very helpful. The flight from LAX to Kona Hawaii however was awful. The flight attendants were rude short tempered and often ignored passengers questions. This was a five and a half hour flight to not even provide peanuts as a snack is ridiculous considering the cost of the food available for purchase. I will say the ground crew in Tucson LAX and Kona were fantastic and really went out of their way to help out. My issue is that the ground crew doesn't work for United and I didn't buy my ticket from them. United seriously need to work on their customer service relations!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-10-05;On a recent trip we flew 3 times with United. The first flight was on 9 September and we flew from Vancouver to Denver with a stopover en route to Albuquerque. These seats were all booked by a travel agent and confirmed 5 months prior to travel. On the first flight my husband and I were seated separately - I was seated behind my husband. We were given water and/or soft drink during the flight. The attendants were very brisk and almost rude in the 'service' they offered. But the flight did leave and arrive on time. The connecting flight however was not such a straight forward experience. When we went to the check-in we were informed by the staff that the flight had been over booked and that we at that stage were the over booked people. They did not apologise in fact they treated us very rudely. They spent the next hour and a half offering 2 passengers other flights hotel accommodation and $500 flight vouchers each in an effort to allow us to board the flight. Eventually and approximately 3 mins before the flight doors were to close after boarding and after I stood at the counter for around 10 mins they informed me that we could board. Again we were seated separately with my husband at the back of the plane and me sitting at the front. Never any apology. Our third flight was on the 13 September and we flew from Albuquerque to LAX in readiness for our flight back to Auckland NZ. The staff at the airport were again rude. Our flight left more or less on time and the flight staff were great bright and friendly. They actually appeared to be enjoying their job and treated the passengers with friendliness and courtesy. We actually managed to sit together on this flight.;NEGATIVE

The Agent was amazing and put me on another airline that would get me home to my family. Forever grateful! Once on the plane to Chicago the 1st class flight attendant was very attentive and extremely caring. When I asked if there were any snacks she said that the previous flight had depleted the stock. When I informed her about my birthday flights and the problems I was having she went all out. She offered me her own personal snack out of her purse with a smile. Selfless and sincere. She was a blessing to my day. As I left she handed me a ""care package"" of treats she was able to scrounge up on the plane for and offered me a happy birthday wish. She and the gate attendant both made my long hours and travel home to my family not just bearable but enjoyable.";POSITIVE

They don't provide food on the flight! A 6 hour international flight without food is unacceptable they want you to pay 10$ for poor quality plane food. On top of all of the above mentioned you have to pay for inflight entertainment 7.50$ for 4 hours! In summary I had a 6 hour flight with no food no entertainment and freezing up.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-09-22;I've been a Mileage Plus member and a United frequent flyer since 1995. The programme can offer outstanding benefits if your travel needs match their network. I recently flew LHR to EZE via IAH. And this was fairly typical of my travels in recent years. I booked an itinerary in economy class and upgraded using miles and a cash fee. All flights were upgraded to business first well in advance of my departure. All flights offer lie flat seating. Sleeping for several hours on long haul sectors comes easily. Service is most often generous food is not luxurious but is well presented tasty and enjoyable. Particularly the fish dishes which are my first choice. Drinks are plentiful I love the cheese course rounded off with an ice cream sundae served to order. Followed by a liqueur and coffee. During UA958 from ORD to LHR on the morning of Sept 18th I awoke to discover that my passport had fallen from my pocket and was rested in an impossible to reach location beneath the structure of my seat. I requested some assistance from a flight attendant in the galley hoping that this might be offered after landing. The professional concerned simply picked up a flashlight and a large serving fork. The flight attendant lay flat on the floor and successfully retrieved my passport for me. All done with a smile and a great attitude. While criticisms often aired in forums such as this sometimes come with fair justification. On a good day and certainly with increasing frequency I find the level of service on board United Airlines to be improved and sometimes outstanding. I am a 1K and million mile flyer. I am confident that I will continue to be. There are some lovely people in the friendly skies!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-22;UA635 LAS to LA 15 Sept 2014. UA 306 LAX to BWI 15 Sept. The worst thing that has happened is United merging with Continental. Having been a million mile flyer on Continental I find the flight schedules on United a total mess. Always a hub connection whether it's Chicago Denver Houston Cleveland LA or San Francisco always inconvenient and time consuming. Boarding process is archaic Southwest can unload reload and leave in the time it takes United Passengers to Board. Always delays and excuses. Give me Southwest any day no Mickey Mouse seat charges baggage charges have a decent amount of non stop flights plus at least you get peanuts more than I can say I get from United's unhappy flight attendants.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-22;Very dissatisfied! Today I had a flight from Charleston to Phoenix with a one hour lay over in Houston. Very little time to switch terminals but scheduled by United. While waiting I learned the Charleston flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Told by flight attendant that this is due to one crew member coming late to the flight causing the delay. Now I have 30 min to get to flight which will not happen and have to stay night in Houston. United has reserved flight at 07.30 next morning. Problem: Parking has been prepaid on my vehicle only until my arrival time. My luggage is already in Phoenix as it left on earlier flight. No reservations in Houston for stay. No meal arrangements. I will refuse to travel with United in the future. Just a note. United has offered meal vouchers and hotel.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-22;Travel agent persuaded me to buy economy plus seat tickets at £960 per person for travel on 22nd August 2014. The seats for outward journey LHR-Washington was 19G and E which was fine but on return journey our seats were 27 G and H These seats are just like any normal cheap economy seats. As usual the leg room felt the same as cheap economy seat the space between two aisle seats was the same. Trolley kept hitting passengers. The food was of poor quality on both legs. The seat were sold by their agent claiming that the Economy Plus class is just as good as Premium class of other airlines and few hundred pounds cheaper.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-19;As a Platinum customer I fly a lot with United and it is amazing how bad United has become over the last 5 years. Not only did they delay today's departure for a little bit of rain in DC and called it a thunderstorm but they also let our connection leave without us for our honeymoon. I am less frustrated when it is a business trip as I always expect that United does not make its connections. Last year I did not have a single flight on time and missed 6 flights. The business class had very uncomfortable seats the staff made the same announcement every 20 minutes for about 2 hours that we would be a little bit late. Then they made another announcement that someone would be waiting with information for us in Munich. All we were told at Munich airport was to go to the Lufthansa Service Center. The service agent sen us immediately to the departure gate but did not let the airplane know that there were multiple customers coming. So the plane left 5 minutes before we arrived at the gate after a wild goose chase through Munich airport. After flying for years and being vegetarian I usually bring my own food as I am over the monotonous and tasteless food they serve but today I flew business and I wanted some champagne and a meal. It is always the same and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the dessert has also not changed in the last 5 years. The purser came and apologized in person big deal however she did not have any information for those that got stranded in Munich.What about their new security video between images with kangaroos and people sitting in seats on the beach you get completely lost in their new bizarre security video. As an educator I can guarantee that not 1/3 of people have afterwards a clue of what was said because this looks more like a reality TV series or a bad infomercial. I have been to Africa Peru and Europe on three long flights and the movies between these directions do not change. In the last 6 weeks I have seen almost all of what is worth seeing so that's why I gave the Entertainment 1 star. All in all stay away from United flying with United is no fun anymore the individual customer does not make any difference to United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-19;6012 IAH to LIT non-stop flight due to leave IAH at 12.50 pm cancelled. Reason given was bad weather in Little Rock area. No bad weather in area so that was a bogus excuse. Re-routed to Chicago into LIT. Missed connecting flight in Chicago. Finally caught flight to LIT at 8.30 pm. Upon arrival at LIT could not get bags which had come in on an earlier flight. Terrible service and nobody involved seemed to care.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-19;"The first leg of my trip from Buffalo NY Washington D.C. (IAD-Dulles) was three hours late departing. Weather was fine. September 12 2014. They didn't have a plane? Why sell tickets for ""ghost flight"". My return flight from Washington D.C. (IAD-Dulles) was Sept. 15 2014. Supposed to depart 8.15 am arrive in Buffalo NY 9.35 am. At 7.45 am they text me with a flight delay of 30 minutes. At 8 am they announce that the flight is cancelled because of no crew. Another ghost flight. Go to Customer service where they tell me they can get me home at 11 pm that night which is 9 hours later. I say no. They can put me on US Aiways but I have to go to Reagan National airport. I have no way of getting there so they put me on a shuttle. My checked luggage (which I had checked in at United) ends up in Norfolk VA. I fly on the 4 pm flight from Reagan airport on US Airways to Buffalo NY and get home at 5 pm. I will never fly United again. I have used them for over five years for my flights to D.C. where my son and grandchildren live. The plane was dirty and noisy. The US Airways plane was at least a jet and it was clean and staff were professional.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-19;CCS-IAH-MIA and back Business class. Never have I flown another airline with this kind of awful service small airplanes and old smelly seats pretty uncomfortable for business class. Rude attendants was quite bossy boarding is odd you have a business boarding pass and start wondering how many people fit in that section of the plane before they allow you to board. I have a feeling they inherited the bad service from Continental. One thing is sure no one in his right mind after flying any European Asian or Latin American airline like me will surely never set foot on United's planes again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-19;LAS-ORD-AMS. I try to like United but the delays have become too much. Initially booked LAS-IAD and onward SN connection to BRU. Aircraft change on LAS-IAD led to being bumped onto LAS-ORD-IAD-BRU. Unworkable as ORD layover was only 50 minutes and my parents on separate ticket weren't bumped. Ultimately accepted change to LAS-ORD-AMS on UA metal but with upgrade to E+ for trouble which was appreciated. Tight layover of 75 minutes in ORD. Morning LAS-ORD flight delayed 60 minutes despite good weather across the country. UA agent offered next day's flight if we missed our connection I had to push hard and literally read out each flight number on alternative LH LX and UA flights. Agent was in the end helpful in taking my instructions protecting us on LH flight from ORD-FRA-AMS if flight was missed. Stress remained high. paid for Wifi on ORD to monitor situation. Arrival gate repeatedly changed adding to stress of possible connection success. All the while ORD-AMS flight delayed 40 minutes yet never appeared on UA website or advised by crew throughout LAS-ORD flight. Frantic disembarkment of flight and did not learn of delay until arrived at gate. Set aside improving its operation UA could avoid stress and hassle of employees and pax if it could at least learn how to communicate situations and update flight status's. Seatmate had experienced same mess the day before but unfortunately did have to wait 24 hours for the next UA flight to AMS. ORD-AMS an hour late though ironically great news for us. The infamous and ancient B763 Ghetto Bird window covered in sticky goo but led to free apology wine from FA after I called attention to it and personally cleaned it. Announcements in Dutch noticed and appreciated. Crew notably pleasant. Baggage made connection which was merciful. Food markedly worse than AC and European carriers. Delays are too routine however and with the watering down of MP program I have already actively booked away from US carriers when flying to Europe on next two flights both from the States and Canada. Return on AC B772 was on time and more comfortable all around - food IFE seat.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-17;Had a very bad experience with United Airlines. While travelling from EWR to MSP we boarded the aircraft and were kept sitting for 1 hour then we were told that there were some technical issues so we changed aircraft. Second aircraft also made us wait for one and half hours due to a fuelling issue. Coming back from MSP to EWR the flight was delayed an hour. I will never fly again with United.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-09-17;I was supposed to fly direct from Indianapolis to Washington Dulles Sunday Sept 14 on UA3726. When I got to the airport I was advised the flight had been cancelled earlier that day. The ticketing agent said there were no available flights so I was stranded in Indianapolis until the next morning. She was unwilling to offer any hotel or any other compensation. The only available flights the next day had layovers instead of being direct. I took a United flight easily from IND to ORD the next morning. However the flight from ORD to IAD on UA382 was horrible. We boarded the flight late because there were so many people on standby. Then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours because they said they needed to refuel. Supposed to land at 11:39am but arrived after 1.30 pm.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-17;On 21st August this year my wife and I were to fly United from Heathrow to Chicago and booked in early July. As soon as online check in opened I found that only five seats were left which meant that we were to be separated during the flight. How were all the rest allocated before the 24hr opening time? The night before we were due to fly out I received a text message to say that the flight was cancelled. Whilst on route to LHR a text arrived telling us to check in as normal. At the United desk we were told that we would be bussed to a hotel for the night. The best compensation they could offer was Economy Plus instead of our Economy seats. On the flight out the food was appalling. Drinks were served from jugs carried down the gangways in a very unprofessional style by very unprofessional stewardesses. After arrival at Chicago we thought our problems were over. Whilst in Washington we went to Dulles Airport to see a United Supervisor to ensure that we could sit together on the return flight on 11th September. The system would not allow her to print boarding cards with seat allocations more than 24hrs before departure but she printed some boarding cards and wrote the seat numbers on the cards. For the return journey we arrived in good time at Chicago checked in and boarded the aircraft on time to find that we had been given Economy Plus seats. Start up time came and went and then an announcement was made that an electrical fault existed. We waited eventually after a delay of approx. 1.5 hours we were off back to Blighty. The flight through the night was unpleasant due to the aircraft being very cold which made sleeping almost impossible. Altogether not a very good experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-14;After two years of planning I thought I had all my ducks in a row for a trip from the USA to the Australia Zoo north of Brisbane. I even hired a Travel Agency to avoid any mistakes on my part. Boy was I mistaken. August 25 2014 was finally here. I went to my local airport two hours early (as instructed) and sat there for six hours at the United Airlines boarding gate. We were told the four hour delay was due to the weather in Chicago. Ok not a deal breaker since I had a scheduled six hour layover in Los Angeles. The ticket agent at my local airport is the only good thing about United. She kept track of my schedule and issued me a new ticket from Chicago to Los Angeles when it became obvious that I was going to miss my scheduled flight. I arrived in Chicago four hours late and promptly went to the United gate for my flight to Los Angeles only to to find out that it also was running four hours late. I found another United flight to Los Angeles and got a standby ticket. This flight was running three hours late. Finally I actually got to board a United Airline plane bound for Chicago. Now that all the passengers are onboard the pilot decides he needs to refuel. After maybe ten minutes he announces that the refuelling truck is broken and that the mechanics are working on it. So here we sat waiting to be refuelled. After maybe another hour the pilot announces he was going to taxi over to the international terminal to refuel. Well now it's very clear that I'm going to miss my connecting flight and I can't get off this plane. Fast forward - we arrived in Los Angeles at 2.30 am and my flight to Brisbane Australia left shortly after midnight. I asked the United employee at the gate how to get to the other terminal and she bluntly said the airport was basically closed until 4 am and said I could sleep on the plastic chairs until then. I can't blame anyone for weather delays but the refueling fiasco in Chicago is unacceptable. The rude United employees are unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-14;UA5260 IAH-LIT. Uncomfortable seats unacceptable number of delays in Houston. Lack of concern for inconvenience caused to passengers is unacceptable. These tactics are a sign of pure greed. I will make it a point to never fly this airline again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-14;PDX to MRY round trip Sept 3rd and 10th via San Francisco and via LA. They have consistently delayed flights to/from MRY because they cannot find a plane. On September 3rd they changed gates twice making it difficult for a senior to get to. Today September 10th they are delaying again for the same reason. This means that I'll miss my LA connection because this flight will arrive after the plane leaves that airport. I'm going back to Alaska they can schedule planes to flights.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-14;LHR-SFO. Connecting to this flight from Brussels on Brussels Airlines maybe 4 or 5 folks on this flight going to the SFO flight. Brussels flight late connecting time tight for LHR (scheduled for 70 minutes more like 25 with the late flight and you have to go through security to get to US). Brussels Airlines has not transferred to Star Alliance Terminal 2 yet where United lives so we had a mad dash across from Terminal 1. Got to gate after going through security-one of the agents said don't worry they were holding the flight a few minutes for us. (That's good service). As usual the flight attendants on UA were generally friendly and polite but are not formal like the European or Asian airlines which is fine with me. Food reasonably good. had a chicken dish for lunch that was quite tasty actually. Overall a nice easy flight after working up a sweat running to the gate.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-14;I have to say I was extremely hesitant after reading the reviews on this site and due to fly with UA on 22nd August 2014. I had 5 flights covering a 3 week period and flew from Glasgow - Newark- Las Vegas - San Fran - San Diego back to Newark - Glasgow and was totally happy with the service provided to my family and I. We experienced no delays the cabin crew couldn't have been nicer and the pilots seemed to go out their way to improve passenger comfort. The seating within the plane was large enough in economy and the in flight entertainment was excellent during the international flight to and from Glasgow. All in all I have no issues with any of the flights delays happen and when they do you have to deal with them its a part of every day travel and I'm sure every airline experiences them. Will definitely be recommending UA to anyone who asks.;POSITIVE

united-airlines;2014-09-10;I used to only fly united but my last trip will be the last tome I fly United. I booked a trip to Las Vegas and the flight was delayed. United re-routed my flight through Delta. Delta offered complimentary TV and snacks more leg room and I didn't feel as if I was sitting on my neighbors lap. I think United has forgotten about the customer service which used to be the only reason I would fly with them. I will now definitely try other airlines to pick my go to for travel.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;Flying from Cincinnati to LA at 5.30am - got to the airport about 40 minutes prior to departure - told us we couldn't check our bag (I've flown internationally and have got bags checked with 30 minutes prior to flight and come on - there aren't that many flights leaving CVG at 5 in the morning) however they rebooked us on other flights and we arrived in LA about 1.5 hrs later - ok not so bad except that when the ticket agent changed our outbound flights she cancelled my son's return flights and when we tried to fly home - no flights - luckily another airline for the return but triple connections due to the agent's mistakes. The flights themselves were ok but everything costs extra now.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;After flying from Sacramento to Dulles airport in Washington and then on to Frankfurt it was apparent why United ranks at or near the bottom in the airline ratings. The Airbus 320 to Washington a 5+ Hour flight was brutal. There is no leg room at all the seats are flimsy and uncomfortable and it's impossible to recline your seat because of cramped space. It should be unlawful to pack that many people into limited space. The flight attendants were tired surly and unfriendly. We were in Economy but a row of seats right in front of us were Economy Plus they were empty on our flight. My husband needed to use the bathroom so I sat down in one of the Economy Plus seats until he finished so I could stretch my legs. An FA quickly came over and informed me I couldn't sit there. I told her I was waiting for my husband etc. She said rudely that I needed to return to my assigned seat. There were many empty seats on this flight but when people tried to spread out to get more room they were told no. One man asked if he could sit in one of those seats and was told no because they were Economy Plus. I don't get this attitude. The food was horrendous! There was no food service on the Sacramento to Washington flight which is inexcusable on that long of a flight. Aegean Air from Istanbul to Frankfurt a 55 minute flight served a hot meal - at midnight! There's something wrong with this picture. On the Washington to Frankfurt flight we were served something called a crostini. It had processed lunch meat and processed cheese. It was so horrible I couldn't eat it. Airline food has never been great but it's reached a new low. United should be ashamed of their service. We won't fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;Not great. Flew Newark to Panama bare bones service even have to pay to watch the tiny TV so take an iPad. Minimal service but on time. Transferred to Copa for short flight to Medillin Colombia seemed like first class! When I arrived I was told the was a problem with my return and you had better sort it out. Copa can do nothing with a 'United booking' so called United in USA to find out. Flight had been cancelled although no email received. Eventually got on economy plus and gone via Houston with tight connection but made it ok. They really just get you there and back without any frills. I live in Asia and in a country with usually great customer service US Airlines and United in particular are very basic!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;I took a flight from Shanghai to SFO and onward to LAS. On the return trip from LAS to SFO and then to Hong Kong. 1) Old planes - the planes are so old you don't even get your own personal TV. I remember flying in the 1990s to be just like that when inflight entertainment runs over the large monitor in the front. How is anyone near those screens ever going to sleep on the long flights? 2) Food just is bad. You need to pay for alcoholic drinks. Really? You can't price that into the ticket? 3) Check in at LAS is a nightmare. The auto check-in machines don't really work and require a lot of manual intervention from the staff but there's probably 2 staff serving about 2 dozen machines. 4) Seats are bad.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-10;If I could give United Airlines 0 stars I would. United is a horrible airline with awful customer service unreliable departures dirty airplanes and rude stewards. I booked my ticket 6 months in advance and was bumped to a different later flight about a month prior to my trip. I called the airline and was able to be placed on my original flight. The customer service representative offered no sensical explanation as to why I got bumped. I wanted to ensure I would not be charged for their mistake. The representative assured me I would not be. Well that was not the case. On the day of my flight I found out I had double reservations for two different flights and was charged twice. I immediately called customer service to rectify the situation. I was on the phone for over an hour and the situation was handled horribly. I am beyond disappointed and disgusted with their lack of professionalism. As frequent traveler for both personal and professional purposes I will never fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;MAN-EWR 24/8/14 Flight UA80. I have never experienced a flight in which the crew have seemed almost desperate to pick a fight with passengers!

As well as the staff being incredibly surly I was amazed that they chose to serve a chicken dinner at 10.30am in the morning! They can't even use the rationale that they were working on the destination time zone as we were flying to the US and it would have been 3am there! Luckily the food was absolutely inedible so it wasn't an issue in the end.;NEGATIVE

Lie flat seats were coffin like in a flat position. Service was spotty. Honestly I can't understand this legacy carrier. Emirates' CEO was right when he said his economy product was better than most carrier's business class. A total disappointment but shouldn't have been surprised.

united-airlines;2014-09-06;Unless you want to have hours of intimate contact with a stranger do not fly United! I am a small women in my 60's. United's seat size just fits me. I was in a window seat when a medium-large gentleman a little round around the edges sat next to me. This man was not obese. He overflowed his seat enough that every time he moved we were shuffled together from butt to knee. I put up with it for half an hour and then excused myself to the aisle. I paced in the back of the plane for an hour. The attendants were serving whatever they serve and saw that I was near hysteria at the thought of returning to what awaited me in my assigned seat. They did find a solution eventually. A United employee was flying coach and they switched me out with him. But the new seat was only 3 rows in front of the gentleman who had been next to me and he had to watch this seat change knowing his size overlapping mine was the cause. These conditions are set up by United in planning an aircraft with seats that are way smaller than the human population of these times. They know this and leave it to their flight attendants to deal. Other airline carriers are tight too but I have heard and witnessed that United is the worst.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;SFO/IAH/SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) /IAH/SFO in First on domestic Business on the international flights - 737-900 and 737-800 - pleasantly surprised by the service which was almost perfect (only 1 FA on 1 flight was rude when I was forward enough to ask about whether there would be dessert). New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica. All in all we were happy with the flights unexpectedly so given some prior experiences with the carrier.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;We were on a trip from Newark to San Diego. The nightmare began when we noticed that we (as two friends travelling together) had been assigned seats that were not located next to each other. But we were okay with this. The flight attendants were pretty friendly but drinks were only served 2 times and food was not served at all (on a 5.5 hours flight). There was the option to purchase food but in my opinion it should go without saying that complementary food is offered on a long-distance flight. Onboard entertainment was also not available for free. Furthermore the TV screens could not be turned off so we were exposed to continuing advertising which lasted the whole flight. When we finally reached our destination in San Diego we were tired starving and thirsty.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;IAD - SAV in August. Flight was on schedule both ways which I gather is unusual. The CRJ 200 equipment designed to be uncomfortable was pretty scruffy around the edges. Non stop on this route is convenient. I fly Asian carriers where I live. The FAs while maybe not as professional as they might sometimes be are always friendly well turned out and exquisitely polite. Those on the flights I take back and forth to the US are even more impressive. So imagine my surprise when arriving at the top of the gangway I was greeted by the assigned FA's not inconsiderable rear end. Have good manners been unbundled from the basic ticket price also?;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;My wife and I booked a flight through last minute.com it was really a last minute thing because we had to be in Auburn by the 22nd August 2014. We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel. So instead of going from Syracuse to Washington to Brussels to Birmingham we now had to go from Syracuse to Washington to Dublin then Birmingham. I won't be travelling with them again or recommending them to anyone.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;Flight UA3789 August 27 2014. Boarded an almost new plane that was in pristine condition comfortable seats (travelling on miles and paid for upgrade to premium seating). Ready for a great flight left on time. The flight crew were terrible there were glares from the front of the plane to the back. Almost no eye contact with customers rude finger pointing. When the snack trolley came by they simply walked past directed their comments to the air in front of them and continued on - likely very few sales there! When coffee and drinks came by they were already past before we could even request a drink (we weren't really asked you see) and we had to call them back to get a coffee. When I went to the toilet the crew simply jerked their finger at me without saying anything and gestured me into a seat that was vacant to wait. They scowled at everyone. By the time we left the plane the people in the seats behind me across from me and the seats near the toilets (I heard them talking as well) were totally turned off by our crew. This was the fourth bad experience I have heard of with United in the past year from co-workers and friends. In fact I have as yet to hear a good experience from any of my colleagues. Also when deplaning they gave out erroneous information. They said that those with connecting flights would have their luggage forwarded and they did not need to collect it. It was wrong in that they do need to collect their luggage to go through customs. Fortunately customs officials were asking people to make sure they had their forwarded luggage. Terrible service. I was flying on miles so the value was great the plane was new and comfortable the experience the pits!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-06;YWG-ORD-YWG: Got to the airport in plenty of time check in on United App didn't work for me so had to use the kiosk and have by far the United kiosks take the longest to fill out. Line up through security was long and slow due to only one lane being open (obviously not United's fault but still frustrating). United flight to and from Winnipeg are seldom on time and either delayed or cancelled probably about 70% of the time. It was no surprise to me that it was delayed an hour and a half. Ended up landing in Chicago about 2 hours late. On the way home mobile check in worked and the whole experience was positive. Got to the gate and seeing my flight was on time was too good to be true and it was. It moved gates and was delayed 40 minutes. Both flights were on an E145. I knew it was going to be snug so I can't really complain since I knew what I was flying on. Both flight attendants were pleasant. Overall I will not fly united anywhere other than Chicago or Denver and I'm even hesitant to fly United to those cities non stop.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-01;JFK-SFO. Ground staff at JFK could not have been more helpful. We had a connection to NRT with ANA and our reservation had some issues but it was efficiently solved by the staff and our luggage was directly tagged to NRT avoiding luggage fees despite being on two separate reservations. Flight was ahead of schedule both departure and arrival. Service on United has always been warm friendly and efficient. I'm a big fan of their service and never had an issue. While they are not as polished as most Asian carriers are they are interactive with the passengers and their service makes you feel at home. BOB options were extensive and quality was excellent. They also did frequent beverage runs despite only being a 6-hour flight. IFE system is wonderful the movie choices were great and most of which are recent Hollywood movies. The system was responsive easy to use and the moving map was of excellent quality. Overall a very pleasant flight with United.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-01;"I took a flight from Hong Kong to Newark. Appalling from the moment I stepped on the plane. The staff were very unwelcoming. My seat was behind the exit row which was empty - all the row was empty and seeing as I was sitting between a family who had been split up because of the shoddy seating arrangements we asked if we were able to use the exit row. The response (in an aggressive tone) was no! If you want to sit there its now been designated premium economy its an extra USD 170 each and you can pay by credit card! Note that this in the economy / coach section. The stewardess then made a big deal of slamming down all the dining trays on those seats as if to ""seal off the section"" - it all made for an incredibly unpleasant start to the flight. Aside from the small seats and lack of leg room when dinner came round I politely requested a cup of tea. The cup of tea was passed to me without any milk or sugar. I politely asked for milk and sugar. She stopped - glared at me and snapped - ""well you could have told me that when you asked for the tea"". By this stage me and the family I was sharing the row with were finding the staff so rude it was verging on comical. Then to top it off having spent thousands of dollars on this flight I learn that there is no free alcohol. Don't get me wrong I can go with out a drink for 16 hours but its a small touch to offer an alcoholic beverage as part of the service. Anyway an absolute shambles and I shall not make the same mistake of flying with United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-01;On July 3 we were bound for intercontinental flight from SFO to FRA. Departure should be at 2 pm and was announced for 6.45 pm. After some more trouble boarding started at 8.15. After a tour on the airfield the plane came back to starting point. At least we departed with a delay of nearly 8 hours. The gate staff was completely stressed with the amendment of connecting flights for other passengers. No customer voucher were given no telephone calls offered no service at all.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-09-01;We are a Star Alliance Gold family. We purchased Economy tickets from NRT-IAH-FLL-SCE-IAD-NRT but I later upgraded to BusinessFirst with cash. The cash upgrade cost $1400 each. On the NRT-IAH leg the first thing that I found odd was that the FA literally threw the tablecloth to/at me at the beginning of dinner service. I think he just didn't care because throughout the flight his demeanor was cold. Small things like my wife's request for water without ice were met with the glass of water with the biggest piece of ice in it. The seat was great the food was about what you'd expect at a family restaurant and I'm ok with both of these things but I really had to wonder don't people who pay to fly premium deserve at least not passive-aggressive”service? I guess not. The NRT- IAH departure was an hour late due to weather. We were not able to make our connection at IAH. I bet United Airlines could have helped expedite passengers (through immigration/customs/re-checking) with tight connections. Our IAH-FLL departed while we were waiting for our bags. I informed the UA rep at the baggage claim and he told me they'd rebooked us on the next mornings 06.40 IAH-FLL. I asked if I could get a meal/hotel voucher but he informed me that since it was a weather delay UA couldn't take care of us. We feared that we might oversleep the 06.40 flight because of the jetlag. I called UA to ask for another booking and though there were 4 IAH-FLL flights that day our only options were 06.40 or 20.00 departure. Their website revealed open seats on all flights but the rep explained to me that those were first class seats and we weren't eligible for them. The weather delay on departure was caused by a typhoon. IAH is also known to be quite poor at handling international flights. UA made the decision to sell NRT-IAH tickets with a 1.5-hour buffer nonetheless. Maybe it's my fault for buying it but at any rate rather than stay up all night or lose yet another day with my family we accepted a better-timed flight to MIA. Our business with UA resumed two weeks later for the SCE-IAD-NRT return to Japan we took another carrier for our FLL-MBJ and MBJ-ATL-DTW-SCE trips. I mistakenly placed a bottle of honey in my carry-on which was picked up by TSA at security. I figured that if I couldn't get to my bags I could box and check it. I saw my bags were already gone so I waited at the side of the check-in line and figured I would wait until they announced last call for SCE-IAD. The desk rep soon did so and I politely explained “I'd like to get this in to my checked bags.” The man was the portrait of hypertension and stress. He acted as if the world were about to end. Eventually another rep nicely asked me to go get a box from the store across the hallway and I did and when I came back the stressed-out rep acquiesced and while printing the tape/tags repeated over and over “ The flights boarding/you've got to get on it/it’s leaving.”The flight was just starting to board. I am writing this onboard IAD-NRT. We've decided that we won't fly UA again. We’ll pay more to avoid it.;NEGATIVE

Bad weather at EWR causes major problems for all airlines operating to/from there.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-28;TPA-ORD-LHR: terrible. I know you get what you pay for but I still expect more than this for what was mainly a transatlantic trip. The TPA-ORD leg was the usual 'bus' service you get used to for US domestic trips but the international leg was beyond terrible. The aircraft was old - decor of a bygone era. The TV screens were the sort I remember for a decade ago - tiny no personal controls. The food was stingy and poor quality (a slab of meat resembling a chicken breast at some time in the past). The cabin crew were surly and long past retirement age (who knows what would happen in an emergency). Surely they could stump up at least one complementary alcoholic beverage like other transatlantic carriers. Next time I'll pay more for a much superior service. This is the budget airline of the Atlantic.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-28;Paid high premium for last minute flight. Wasn't given a seat assignment because no coach seats were left and only seats toward the front which they charge $84 to sit in were left. Got seat assignment at gate back of the plane. Received lowest Group Boarding number because the gate agent said they order group number based on where you sit. Windows higher middle lower aisle lowest. But if you fly stand by you get to set in premium seats with better group number getting a better chance to have overhead space because no one wants to pay $84 just to sit closer to the front of the plane which gives you a better group number. Other airlines are based on more you pay more you get. Was already paying max for flight way more than rest because time constraints than other passengers. United does not care about their customers gate agents are mostly grumpy. They have some of the shortest leg room of most carriers.;NEGATIVE

Both flights arrived ahead of schedule which was welcomed since I had only 45 minutes for transfer in Chicago and 48 minutes in Amsterdam to catch inter EU flight. Service basic but good flight attendants offered beverages very frequently and food served on transatlantic flight was OK. My bags joined me a day later at my final destination but it was not UA fault.

The last 2 cancellation reported at 4.17 am for a 6.27 departure (SCE-ORD-YUL) didn't see anything available until 8.30 pm with an overnight at my expense.

I must say that in 20 years of air travel I have never experienced a flight attendant crew as unprofessional as the crew on that plane. They were very short with passengers! The over head bins were full and they asked that stored our bags under the seats in front of us. I am 6' 2"" the new planes have even less room to fit your legs and feet. Once you bag goes there where are you to put your feet and legs? Keep in mind all I had was a computer bag. I was sitting mid plane in an aisle seat I asked if there was any room up further for my computer bag - ""No if you don't like it the next flight in 3 hrs is less full if you would like me to arrange it for you"". This was the reply in a very threatening tone! A few moments later I watched the same scenario happen to 2 more passengers with the same consequences. Very unprofessional atmosphere! This atmosphere and overall attitude seems to be becoming the normal for United. Flight #431 departed Houston 8.55am arrived Mex City at 11.10am.";NEGATIVE

The food was better than I expected it to be. They served so many appetizers before the main course that I was full. I was so surprised when they asked if I would like ice cream and customized it with toppings right in front of me! If you were hungry between meals there is a walk up bar that has fruits snacks wraps desserts etc. The IFE had a huge screen and had all the newest Hollywood blockbusters tv shows music and games. The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat. I slept right after the Meal service and was woken up just in time for breakfast. I couldn't believe that I could actually get sleep on a plane! It was a great experience flying United and would definitely fly with them again.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-15;"The second time United Airline had failed me. The first was on October 2013. This review is about my last flight in August 14. I was flying from Houston Texas to LAX. There was a storm near Texas and we were delayed about 2 hours. I understand there are natural disasters out of the airlines control. The problem is how these situations are handled. First one of the flight attendants seemed annoyed by people asking if they could use the restroom and get some water. The other flight attendant was very nice and she tried her best to accommodate peoples needs. Once we were in the air they started selling food to people about an hour into the flight. I have a gluten free restriction and they had very limited options. I wanted the cheese plate with grapes and chocolate and they sold out! That was pretty much my only option. Finally we arrived to LAX 2+ hours late and the gate didn't work. So we waited once again to be let out. Finally it was time to go get my luggage which was taken from me in Texas because there was no more room for my bag. I was the last one on the flight because they had a computer glitch and they couldn't find my seat. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the problem. They didn't tell me if I should wait by the door or go to baggage claims once I arrive at LAX. Once I arrived at LAX I tried asking about my luggage but there was big lines to talk to someone. There seem to be many other problems last night. Finally I asked one United flight attendant and with an attitude she told to go to baggage claim. I told her nobody had explained to me where to get my bag and she was annoyed with my questions. I had flown in other airlines were my luggage was given to me once I exited the plane! It was a legitimate question. Once I was in baggage claim they had about 5 different places two pick up luggage. 3 out of the 5 screens was broken. I asked another Inited employee where I could get my luggage and again with an attitude she said ""Obviously it's right there can't you see it?"". I told her their screens are broken so no I can't see it. Most United Airline employees are rude disrespectful and not helpful. They seem to hate their job.

What was upsetting was that our flight was delayed three hours and there was not any fog in the area. In fact there was partial sunshine the day of our flight. The staff did not even apologize or attempt to assist the customers who had connecting flights in Chicago. Once on the aircraft the flight attendant was very rude and demeaning.

Miserable gum chewing flight attendants that looked like they'd just crawled out of bed. Nearly bumped off one flight altogether and the staff couldn't care less.

On the way home the same issue of not being able to claim seats without paying. Then on the way home we had a delay once again from Houston to Dallas.

Besides the service the meals have also improved. There are more healthy choices such as a salad with grilled chicken and fresh toppings chicken wrap and the likes. And then there are those sumptuous warm chocolate cookies that they serve at the end. This flight had not IFE so I resorted to using my iPad and paid for the very inexpensive inflight wifi service.

We ended up going to Morocco from there and were helped by both Air Maroc and the Belgians. On the way back to the U.S. we were then bumped from our flight due to United giving away our pre-booked tickets to another family. They then complained to us that we were late when we were in fact 3 hours early.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-15;Houston - Indianapolis - Houston. Both sectors on an Embraer 145 aircraft that had some of the hardest seat cushions I've ever experienced.

united-airlines;2014-08-15;Horrible experience on a Tuesday night flight United flight delays because of some rain from Charleston WV to Chicago caused me to miss flight to Memphis. United only rebooked flight the next day. No offer to put up in hotel. Had to stay in the airport and just sit for 9 hours waiting on the next flight (which got delayed too). It took over 19 hours to go from Charleston to Memphis. I should have taken a Greyhound bus it would have been much cheaper and faster. Horrible service they simply don't care. Never will fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-15;United Airlines needs serious work on maintenance pilots and air crew. I fly (or used to up till now) about 6 times a month for the last 6 years. I can count on 1 hand the number of flights that actually left or arrived on time. There were crew issues (I sat at the gate with the plane present for over 1.5 hrs waiting on a crew from another flight to show up). There were maintenance issues (we are on the plane which was late showing up in the first place supposed to leave at 8.50 plane shows up 9.20. Load the plane by 9.40 sit at the gate because main door would not indicate sealed until 10.15 then cancelled flight. Wait over 12 hours for a new flight). Pilot issues (plane late arriving again after 2 hour delay pilots get on load plane plane pulls out of gate then returns to gate. Pilots leave flight their hours are up. Time used while sitting at gate on phones not flying). If I'm late by 1 minute the door shuts can't get on the plane ok my fault. I sit waiting for over 12 hours because the plane has issues suck it up not even a sorry.;NEGATIVE

The night before out flight I tried to check in and on one of our flights the only way to get to claim seats was by paying 40$ per person. Ridiculous as I had booked the flight months ago. Departing there was a 40 min delay due to ""lack of personnel"" but as we were boarding the pilot came on saying there was no reason for the delays and that the crew were all there. On the way home the same issue of not being able to claim seats without paying. Then on the way home we had a delay once again from Houston to Dallas. The first delay was due to ""awaiting aircraft"" and it was 50 min then we boarded the plane 15 mins late due to delayed customers then a final delay of 45 min due to operations. Absolutely ridiculous especially as I paid 100 dollars more for an earlier flight.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-15;Flying on this United Express service Embraer RJ 135 from Houston to Nashville was a very claustrophobic experience. Being 190cm when I walked in I had to seriously bend over for the ceiling is very low. The 2-1 seating configuration is a good indicator of how small and narrow the cabin really is. All-in-all felt like flying in a cigar tin can. These regional jets are not my favourite yet they seem to be getting more prevalent in the United network.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;"We flew home from Germany to Alberta Canada we had a stop over in Chicago IL. United Airlines had the worst service we have ever had from an airline company. The people were very unhelpful. Here is what happened an explanation of why we are so disappointed. The customer service was the worst we have had. It was our honeymoon we boarded our initial flight in Barcelona Spain with a different airline they flew us to Germany at which point we were to get on our UA flight. The first thing that annoyed us was that the UA airline baggage people didn't even make an effort to get our luggage on our first UA flight (this is something we didn't find out until we were already in Chicago). The lady we spoke to in Chicago simply said ""you had a short layover and in cases like that we don't get the luggage because its too difficult."" Once we were in Chicago and realized our baggage hadn't made it onto our plane we were told that it would be very easy to give the UA baggage office our address and they would ship them to us the next day. So we landed in Calgary (an hour late) and went to the UA baggage office to report our missing bags and give our address to them. We waited at their office for 1.5 hrs. This was a very frustrating experience in regards to the baggage and customer service. On a final note I would not recommend traveling with United Airlines (Lufthansa)!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;Flew Houston-Denver in Economy Plus. UAL charges you extra for deplorable seats. So narrow that the normal sized guy next to me was half in my seat. And the so called extra leg room is a scant 3 inches more for $50. The guy in front reclined his seat all the way ans I thought I was in a tiny cage. UAL charges for AV service. The snack pack for $8 was just OK. The flight staff was friendly - the only positive about this airline.;NEGATIVE

This was a brand new plane and in first class the seats were so close I could not get out of my seat without disturbing the passenger in front of me or to my side. Food was spoiled with rancid oil used. Staff could care less. Not even power for my laptop to get work done. Wi-Fi entertainment power all advertised and paid for but got none of it.

The question of whether I was in for an adventure aka a delayed flight to a completely different location was condescending. No apology until I dealt with a woman at the end of the process. She treated the situation with sensitivity and realized that as a traveler and customer this could possibly be stressful and frustrating. As their customer it seemed like my Sunday was worth less than everyone on the plane. Perhaps they should under board planes not over board them to make more money.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;Completely disorganized unfriendly and the least bit helpful. The customer service from the second I came into the airport in Toronto were so unwelcoming. After printing out my boarding passes at the kiosk with no help (Sunwing kiosks had assistants walking around assisting people) struggled with a kiosk and then headed to the line to check bags in. The girl at the desk just seemed so unimpressed and was very cold towards my family and I. Upon going through customs it was very disorganized and very little help was offered while at the receipt kiosks. While going through baggage check the man checking our carry ons was telling everyone that passed that our flight was cancelled. Mind you the smartphone app said the flight was on time early actually. We then got into the waiting area there was just a sense of panic going on and nobody knew what was going on. A flight attendant came and confirmed it was cancelled. Maybe 10 minutes went by and another flight attendant came by and said it was in fact running on time and not to worry. All in all very disorganized and unwelcoming. I've always flown with Sunwing and I guess next time I won't be travelling with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;"I have had several problems with UA over the years and tend to avoid them but recently I had no good option other than to travel with them from SFO to Dulles round-trip in economy class. The return flight on a 757-300 was horrific with turbulence for hours. The pilot never really commented on it other than a brief ""It's bumpy so I've turned on the seat belt sign"". I am only 5' 2"" and 105 lbs. and I was unable to sit without my knees hitting the seat in front of me. There was no in-flight entertainment at all. I will continue to avoid flying UA at all costs even though they have a hub near us in SFO. My past grievance with them concerned their small seats rude flight staff and last-minute flight cancellations back-to-back with other overbooked flights. While turbulence is turbulence it was handled very poorly.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;Flight from Detroit to New York was 3 hours late which meant we arrived so late that there was nothing left of the day despite only a 1 hr 50 min flight.

The older female was very harsh and unfriendly. We will never fly United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE

Ended up having to run to catch the plane. Don't know why they didn't open more lanes the line never got any shorter. When we finally got to the front the line was just as long if not longer than we got there 2.5 hours earlier. Stewardess's were not friendly. Only good thing was flight was on time.;NEGATIVE

It wasn't until we went online to do our check-in that we found out about the cancelled flight. The first reservationist we spoke to was not very helpful. She had us booked to return home the next day in economy and not first class as was paid for stating this was all that was available. We weren't satisfied with her ""solution"" so we called UA back and spoke with another reservationist who was more helpful. Not only did she offer us another first class flight but it was also on the same day as originally planned (not the next day). Dealing with the first reservationist was very frustrating.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;The in-flight service and cabin cleanliness was terrible. I have flown this flight before it has been fine. This time around the flight staff were rude or off-handish. One flight attendant abruptly placed the food tray stating 'only chicken' when another flight attendant actually had pasta. When questioned we were spoken to rudely. The toilets were not cleaned on other airlines they clean as you go. My wife mentioned to the flight attendants and their reply was 'you should see the rest of China' - we actually live in Beijing. They also said that she should wait until Beijing when it will be cleaned. Also in years past (18 years I have been flying with UAL) United had been much better. Flight attendants didn't know when to turn lights on or off or when they were suppose to start the food/beverage services. Where has the United I once knew gone?;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;MEL-SYD-LAX-IAH-GIG. Paid an economy ticket and was upgraded on all flights to Business using one global credit. Service out of Melbourne was superb - attentive crew and a light load. Out of Sydney the flight was full but again the crew were attentive and service was fairly good. The flight LAX/IAH was particularly good - the crew were amazing. The last flight IAH-GIG was superior - the 772 was much newer than the one used on the SYD-LAX route and crew did not disappear for hours in the middle of the flight. The dinners were good but the breakfasts average. Considering the price paid for the ticket I was pleasantly impressed. All flights left on time and arrived on schedule or ahead of schedule. After 39 hours of travel time I was left feeling not too bad!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-08-08;"I have flown with United Airlines multiple times so this is no ""one time"" incident. To have a something go wrong is almost unavoidable. My last experience for example was the last flight of a series of flights from Prague to New Orleans if only it were that easy. The final flight from Washington to New Orleans was supposed to leave at 6:50. There was a ""late inbound aircraft arrival"" which kept us all in the airport for 3 hours constantly being reassured that the flight would be there shortly. I wish I could say that this incident was the only time it has happened but unfortunately this is a feeling quite familiar to a United Aircraft flyer.";NEGATIVE

We waited 2 hours more for rebooking on next day flight they lodged us for overnight in a poor hotel. When finally we took the next days flight crew on board were unpleasant neither a smile nor a ""thank you"" especially for the offloaded passenger of the previous day.

united-airlines;2014-08-08;I booked a straight flight from Washington Dulles to Toronto CA. Keep in mind that this was a weekend trip and I was supposed to return Monday afternoon. My departing flight was scheduled for 3.20pm and we boarded around 4pm. The pilot announced that the door could not close completely so we had to wait for an Engineer to fix it. We waited on the plane for an hour. The Engineer came and it took an additional 30 minutes. We got on the runway then the pilot announced that Toronto had issued a no-fly restriction due to severe thunderstorms. We waited on the runway for an hour. They took us back to the terminal and after about 2 0minutes it was time to take off again. We got back on the runway went to the same spot to prepare for take-off when the pilot announced that Toronto Intl. issued another no-fly restriction and we had to wait 30 more minutes. So we did. Then later they called the plane off the runway and cancelled the flight. It took 2 hours to get to customer service so they could help me get on another flight. The Agents were so rude and barely attempted to help me find something that would take me to Toronto that night! Ended up booking me on a 5.45am flight Saturday morning. I left Washington Airport at 11pm. Saturday morning I got on a connecting flight through Texas. What was supposed to be a straight flight to Toronto took 6 hours! To make matters worse my new booking was out of Reagan Airport so I had to adjust my return flight. They gave me a flight back on Air Canada (the Toronto to Chicago leg). I stood in line to check in and learned from the agent at Air Canada that United never officially reserved the seat for me. I had to run to United get them to reserve the flight give me a print out so that I could return to Air Canada. I connected in Chicago. The United flight from Chicago to DC was hour late. I lost time money and sleep. United had no compassion and was unapologetic.;NEGATIVE

The United International Economy Plus product is quite simply one of the worst available when aboard a crusty old 747. The IFE was antiquated and the movies were b-movies at best. The plane is old and crusty and desperately in need of an update. Flight attendants were indifferent and nearly tossed meal trays onto your fold down tray. Seats were dilapidated. Flight took off and landed late. This United international product is sub-standard and should be an embarrassment to United Airlines.

united-airlines;2014-08-03;LHR-ORD-LHR. Initial impressions of United were not great as I attempted to check in online only to find that their website system 'could not check you in at this time' after going through the whole process! United now operate from the new terminal 2 at Heathrow which is a big improvement. However upon boarding it was noticeable that the 767 was quite old (pre Boeing 'signature interior' and my seat was uncomfortable. The IFE system is also outdated and was unreliable. However the flight was punctual. The check in system for my return flight ORD-LHR was poor. Initial check in at the airport required using an automated terminal but I could not select a seat as these are allocated at the gate. It is then necessary to queue again to be allocated a seat. There is also not enough space in the departure area to accommodate everyone travelling on the flight. The onboard conditions were also similar on the return flight to the outbound (same aircraft type) except that I was bumped down into the standard economy section from the Economy Plus section. As someone who is 6ft plus this meant squeezing into a cramped seat with minimal legroom - totally unsuitable for a lengthy flight. In addition they ran out of meal choices so passengers had to 'get what they are given'. United also have a stingy policy of charging for alcoholic drinks at inflated prices. Once again the seat was not comfortable and the IFE system was not even working this time. Thankfully arrival was slightly early and the arrival process at Heathrow was most efficient. I will try to avoid flying with United again until they improve the quality of their product.;NEGATIVE

My seat worked ok but my wife had to manually lift the leg support on hers and couldn't unhinge the foot rest. Then in addition the reading light for her seat wouldn't turn off. On-board staff were great: sincerely apologetic for the lack of amenities profusely sympathetic about the seat problems. Service was excellent.

united-airlines;2014-08-03;I boarded UAL 771 July 25th SFO to LAX. I had an International flight to catch on another airline. While I have had my share of grumpy UAL flight attendants I immediately noticed a different energy in the FC cabin when I entered (I bought FC - it was not a complimentary upgrade). There were two male flight attendants being warm and welcoming. They were constantly seeing what passengers needed (it was a 24 seat 757). They knew how to handle every request and not just with a sterile perfunctory smile. The mood among all of the passengers was noticeably different. I'm not sure that many of UAL's FA's know how significant they are in creating an energy on the plane among the people by the way they welcome and serve the passengers. Most FA's know how to serve a cup of water. That does not take much skill. However to serve the water and give the sense that it is done graciously is something else.;POSITIVE

I got to the hotel at 1.30am and they took me back to the airport at 4am to catch a flight that was of course overbooked. I finally got a flight (on a different airline) 12 hours later. I understand that some circumstances simply cannot be helped. That is the gamble that goes along with travel. It is the being lied to and treated so poorly which made my experience so terrible.;NEGATIVE

When an airline can't provide adequate service from Milwaukee to Chicago they should just fold up their tent and go home. Don't pretend to be a transportation service when you can't transport people as promised. Scheduled this trip specifically to attend a theatre production produced by a friend.

No help or assistance. I complained to United officially on my return to the UK and in fact they ""granted"" me a voucher for $150 off my next booking. They added that they hoped that this did not give me a bad impression of United. Unfortunately I had already made my next booking to the US with United travelling Belfast to Newark to Knoxville early July. Flights from Newark to Knoxville cancelled two days in a row. As there are 3 of us this time I have to find hotels for 2 nights in a row. One positive that came of this was that United re-routed us to Knoxville via Atlanta using Delta. On the way back from Knoxville via Washington to Newark the United flight was delayed by 2 hours. We are then re-routed from Washington to London then Belfast. It maybe incidental to note that no other airlines had delays at Knoxville that day? At least we get home albeit some 4 hours later than expected. Due to delays in arriving we miss the connection London to Belfast.

On my return flight scheduled at 2.30 pm from Dulles the flight was delayed twice then cancelled at 6pm. Provided with a $100 coupon - certainly doesn't pay for a hotel room in DC. My original plan - flying back on the 10.10 pm flight indeed proved irrational. It was also delayed. I asked the customer service agent to put me on American 6.15 flight to LA. She refused pointing out that I was on backup for 10.10 pm with United. She reissued my ticket on American at the coach rate. She also incorrectly copied down the gate to delay my progress. Thankfully they were on the same concourse. When I made it to American I indeed confirmed that there still was an open first class ticket. The lovely American agent called United and unfortunately did no better than I had for the past three hours finding someone who could reissue the ticket as first class. American graciously put me in the last seat without any help and much hindrance from United.

I politely complained and was offered a chicken wrap from economy. I offered to pay but money refused. This is not a route with complimentary upgrades. Everyone paid to sit up front. I can't understand why UA continues to alienate customers.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-29;"Because I wanted to try a 787 I flew LAX-Shanghai then returned on a 747-400 Shanghai-SFO. While the seats are more-or-less simulated business class and the entertainment selection is quite good the service quality is the worst in my 35 year experience. The ""flight attendants"" apparently come to work only to qualify for free travel as they most certainly do not go out of their way to provide anything approaching ""service"". The meals and drinks were delivered with all of the passion one expects when one of these veterans delivers the FAA pre-flight announcements. I despised making any contribution to wages these people did not earn. Given a choice between United and Aeroflot I'll likely choose Aeroflot. I fly 10-12 times per year and make the Asia flight 406 times annually this round trip is the worst I've had in 35 years of travel. My advice: fly anyone but United.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-29;I was flying from Orlando to Vegas with connection in Houston. First flight was delayed about 4 hours (not due to weather so it was just because of United and their lack of or poor maintenance of planes). This made me miss my connecting flight so I had to wait in the huge line to get a flight to Vegas. I finally made it to Vegas about 5 hours later. They didn't apologize or give me anything for the inconvenience. Then the day came for my flight back to Orlando which I was dreading. My flight from Vegas to Houston wasn't too delayed so I figured it was a good day. Boy was I wrong. I arrive in Houston at around 2.30pm only to find out that my flight back home was cancelled and they put me on a flight to Orlando the next day at 9pm. I had to wait in the massive customer service line to see if I could get on an earlier flight. After about an hour I get to the front and they told me they can put me on a flight to Jersey with a connection to Orlando. It would get me home by 1am so I figured to do that. Well surprise surprise the flight to Jersey was delayed which made me miss the flight to Orlando which was the last flight. I had to stay the night in Jersey at the airport because they wouldn't pay for any hotel. All in all they had me hopping from state to state like if this was a game and never apologized. I'll never fly with them again.;NEGATIVE

The delay did not augur well for my not-so-pleasant experience in the flight: no water in the loo food was miserable (the sweet sour chicken meal was kind of soupy and was tasteless) and one particular stewardess was quite snappy. The good thing was the uneventful flight which was a relief considering the week's news. Another good thing was my ""seatmate"" was transferred next to family so I had two seats to myself. My ""no"" recommendation was specifically for this plane and crew.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-29;When boarding United flight 919 from LHR to IAD on July 22 2014 I was mortified to be humiliated by a flight attendant because I could not reach the overhead bin to stow my carry on bag. The plane is large and I am 5'1 not tall enough to reach the bin. At 69 I also do not have strength to lift a bag over my head. Berating this to me she said if I could not put the bag in the bin myself then it would have to be checked. Other passengers were shocked at her response to my predicament and of course a kindly tall gentleman immediately put it in the bin for me. On departing the aircraft a tall woman who had heard the attendant earlier came over to take down the bag. The attendant's attitude and manner was very rude. I was in seat 27D for which I had to pay an extra $125. I have been flying across the Atlantic for 53 years. This was my first and hopefully last trip I'll make on United.;NEGATIVE

No explanation. No food voucher (not that we were going to get fed on a 10 hr flight anyway). Grumpy ground staff who obviously had had no customer service training. Luckily got reconnected through Delta who were obliging helpful and got us into NYC with no problem. United's aircraft are old there staff are lazy and unhelpful and they are years behind European Asian and Pacific airlines in regards customer service. Star Alliance should dump them.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-29;My wife and I flew from San Diego to Paris France. On the return trip the video on the plane was inoperative and we flew 10 hours with no movies or sound. The second leg from Washington to San Diego had no video screens available on the plane and the power plug under our seat did not charge our electronic device so we could not watch a movie we had downloaded as we used up our battery on the previous flight from Paris. To top it off one of our bags didn't arrive with the rest of our luggage and hasn't turned up a day later. Needless to say the airlines should have compensated us for the lack of video service during an international flight. The missing luggage might turn up hopefully! The crew were excellent. Not their fault!;NEGATIVE

Leg room of the economy seats was quite a problem. I had cramps so I had to move to the backmost seat which was free. I spent the duration of the entire flight from Heathrow to Newark (connecting flight) catching up with my readings. Seeing that I was busy and not relaxing at all the crew were nice and even gave me a box of chocolates! I must mention that the touchdown was the best I have experienced. My recommendation is based purely on this flight alone.;POSITIVE

The seat was actually reasonably roomy and thankfully the middle seat of three was vacant. The idea that United now charges for alcoholic beverages on even such a long haul flight really sets them apart from their competition in a bad way. The food was probably the worst I've ever had on an airline and that's saying a lot. Entertainment options were fine but the remote control at y seat did not work and the touchscreen worked only badly. Watched one movie and then slept. Overall though I felt as though I was flying on a budget airline and I wasn't! United step up your game!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-27;This is the second time I have flown United. The first time was without incident. Great trip just lots of stops. This time however the plane I was getting on in Albany was late arriving and thus we were late taking off. This resulted in our flight arriving in Newark too late to catch the connection flight. Not only was I now delayed a day but I was told by the airline that I would likely have to travel to LaGuardia by bus or taxi but they would not cover the cost. This is insane. Also the airline did not seem to have any thought of giving a discount. I purchased a service and the service was not provided. In any other industry I would not pay for this. This will be the last time I travel with United. I will pay the extra money and take a more reliable airline.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-27;Flew YYC-IAH yesterday on B737 and have to say nice flight mainly because of the class of service and the nice crew on board. Plane interior had seen better times and looked a bit outdated. Delay almost made up during flight. The friendly skies are much more friendly in Business than in Economy and unfortunately the gap between the 2 classes are way too big. In the future I hope United will shine some friendly 'skylight' towards the back of the planes to really earn the friendly sky status for all classes.;POSITIVE

Four croutons on my salad and ordinary less costly meal choices. 2 mid-priced white wines offered and wasn't even offered a refill during the meal. Had to pay 16.95 USD for WiFi despite a 10000+ USD ticket. Crew has rules about bags on the floor on take-off (even underneath the pod in First Class) and requests we wear shoulder plus lap belts - unlike other airlines. Even check-in was below par no dedicated lines. Nice big seats and big meal portions but equal or less than many other airlines' business class at double the price.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-27;"United has recently changed its airplane (routing from PVG-ORD) from a 777 with personalized on-board entertainment in economy to a ""new"" 747 was shared projection screens. Also they recently changed their US/Asia route to also require payment for alcoholic beverages for those not in business or first-class. Travelling from China to the US quite often the 13+ hour flight seems even longer now that I have no control over what I can watch and no free drinks to ""shorten"" the travel time. In addition to these new changes the United crew has always been less than pleasant. It seems that the passengers are an inconvenience and I have heard the crew yell at each other on more than one occasion. Given the above I have changed my frequent flier membership to another Star Alliance airline and avoid flying United at all costs. It's just not worth the pain when flying that far and that long.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-27;London - Newark June 14 2014. I used my miles to purchase a ticket back to New York last month and was a bit nervous because I hadn't flown with United in a while and wasn't sure how the quality would be. Luckily it was better than I expected! The entertainment was pretty old and barely usable unless I wanted to go deaf by turning up the volume to its max. Since I wasn't using it flight crew asked me to swap with a couple who had a broken machine which I did. The crew member then forgot to give me my drink skipping my row completely until I reminded him. I was a bit annoyed but you know staff get busy and flustered. I enjoyed my flight smooth and got home safely so cannot fault it. One thing that made me smile is that an older crew member who witnessed me giving up my seat and then getting my drink forgotten thanked me personally and talked about how the crew really wanted to encourage good experiences for everyone. Anyway I quite liked the flight so well done United.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-27;Ever since Continental merged with United it has been downhill. My flights are repeatedly delayed for various reasons but mainly due to technical issues because they have so many old planes still in service. On my most recent flight my flight was delayed for five hours. The plane did not show up for three hours due to 'weather grounding' which was totally false because the weather was fine in Houston even if there were thunderstorms it would not have grounded for three hours. Then we were boarded and the pilot mentioned they had technical issues. I still do not understand why they would board an entire plane before knowing if/how long it would take to repair everyone sat in the plane for two hours until they were finally able to fix and take off. We were told to contact United for 'compensation' due to the trouble and I was offered $50 (only because I have status otherwise it would have been $25) due to our inconvenience. Apparently a new policy just instituted to give you even less because in the past for something similar I received $100 and $150. They do not even care anymore about customer service so I am moving onto another airline.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-20;My worst flight was 2 weeks ago with United. My original flight was re-routed due to delays and not being able to make my connection. My re-routed trip had a connection which was delayed several times. Several passengers requested clarity to the problem and were given vague excuses and lied to several times. When the final flight was boarding I along with several others were denied boarding as the plane provided was not large enough to accommodate all reservations. I spent that night in the airport and flew to a different location the next day. The staff were unprofessional and created nothing but frustration and anger for many passengers. The planes were uncomfortable and I felt as if we were cattle being driven to our destination. I will never choose United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-20;I find that United ground crew in particular seem to delight in going out of their way to be surly (on a good day) or nasty (typically). We flew coach today but honestly it doesn't seem to make a difference. Continental was a great airline that was merged with a terrible one and since the merger we have tried to avoid United wherever possible. Old United equipment substandard IFE overall bad attitudes no matter which cabin you find yourself in. Flying United is an endurance marathon. If we fly up front I am annoyed that we spent money or miles for bad attitudes. When we fly in the back I am annoyed by horrible service inedible food (we bring our own now) and shabby cabins. It's time for the United brand to retire.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-20;I flew out of LAX at 6 am July 9 2014. The flight took off at its scheduled time. The only complaint I had concerning this flight is it makes no sense to me for the airline to load the front of the plane first. It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons. Charging an extra $25 for the first checked bag will preclude my flying United in the future.;POSITIVE

Furthermore having made this trip from Germany/USA several times with other various airlines in comparison United has old planes and less amenities. Lastly there was no way to request a special meal from their website I looked and looked but the meal option was continually grayed out and ended up having to call customer service - another inconvenience.";NEGATIVE

We had to ask one of them could they collect trash after eating and he grunted and went off to get a bag and when we said thanks he just glared at us.

united-airlines;2014-07-17;I was booked on another flight after my original flight was cancelled due to Hurricane Arthur. I decided to check- in for this flight as I would have to get up at 5am to catch it. At 7pm when I went to check in online I found out that my flight had again been cancelled (couldn't blame the weather - reason given was no crew) and I was re- scheduled for a flight at 1.30pm. There was no email sent to me nor was I contacted to be informed of this change less than 10 hours before my flight. When my flight 5876 was cancelled on 3 Jul 14 there were 2 staff members to re-schedule over 50 people - it takes about 45 minutes for the staff to re-schedule each person. How come United could not find more staff - this was known there would be cancellations predictable that flights would be cancelled. Overall a pretty shabby performance from United. Now again today they cancelled my flight - also did not inform me at all - I found out by accident by looking at their website. This was the only flight cancelled going to Harrisburg PA. Flights cancelled 3 times in the last 3 weeks and no-one told me. They have all my contact information and send me my boarding passes and tickets but won't tell me when a flight is cancelled.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;I was on my way to Houston at McAllen airport and for almost 12 hours they kept postponing the flight every 30-90 minutes until finally cancelling one of the flights after about 6 hours but letting us know that we could go on a flight that again was postponed several times for about 5 hours until they finally cancelled the flight. Bottom line they kept me in a small airport from almost 9am until 9pm and then no flight. I've heard similar problems with this airline. Seems the service offered by this airline has declined tremendously since the merger (Continental + United). Very unreliable and I definitely try to avoid using this airline at least until there is significant improvement in service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;This week will be the last time I fly United Airlines. I made the mistake of doing a status match program after having Delta status for years simply because I thought that there was better options for flights into my business territory Canada. Today is the final straw in what has been a nightmarish year of unavoidable layovers constant delays cancelled flights and the worst customer service experience possible. I had a flight to Halifax scheduled today. I get to Newark airport for my 2 hour layover and see that my flight is leaving from Concourse A which has no lounge or other comfortable place to get work done. I take the dingy bus to Concourse B/C to use the lounge. While in the lounge I wasted a good hour trying to get Internet to work. I went to the front desk and reported that the Wifi was very slow. The lady behind the desk said that no one else had reported this then went on talking about her vacation pay hours remaining with another United employee. When I arrived in the lounge initially I asked while checking in if they were announcing all flights and was told yes. I did also hear them announce many flights but there was never an announcement for mine. I realized it was 7.05 and my flight left at 7.30. I raced to the bus to Concourse A by the time I arrived at Gate A20 was told that I would not be going to Halifax. I went to the customer care line where I stood for over 5 minutes while 2 agents ignored me. I sat there for almost 10 minutes while she typed away without saying a word to me. Finally she started telling me there was a flight from Houston tomorrow but no seats on it. I heard a passenger next to me say something about a flight to Moncton and asked the agent next to me if there was a flight to Moncton tonight. I asked the staff member to look into the Moncton flight and without saying a word she got up and walked away. Finally got onto the Moncton flight which left 40 minutes late. Again no apologies for the inconvenience to us passengers who foolishly chose to spend our money with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;Recently flew business class with United from Narita to IAD. For my $13000 r-t ticket I got the narrowest business class seat I've ever been in. They squeeze 8 across in their 777s including 4 abreast in the center aisle. Basically an unfriendly cabin staff that showed little initiative in anticipating customer needs and were inflexible and downright rude in enforcing cabin protocol (use of first class rest rooms when business class facilities were wait listed even though the only people in first class were the second pilot and co-pilot). Food was mediocre and served with little flair.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;Would not recommend anyone use this airline. Cancelled our flight and did not get booked until the following day. Lines were long in Kansas City had 2 people working. The facilities are old or not functioning. Worst travel experience ever!;NEGATIVE

On 13 July Flight 4856 was delayed 3 hours due to mechanical on inbound then further delayed for unknown reasons. Connection in Dulles was missed and later flights to Colorado Springs were unavailable. Attempts to rebook into Denver were unsuccessful as they were also delayed multiple times into early AM hours. Travel from Dulles to Colorado Springs was rebooked for 14 July on Flight 6349. That flight was delayed and subsequently cancelled. Travel was rebooked on Flight 1694 to Csprings via Denver though downgraded from business class to economy. That flight was delayed due to crew issues so the Denver COS connection was missed as well. Travel was rebooked on 6259 which arrived in CSprings on 14 July at 10:.56pm. The gate people were very helpful but the system was unresponsive and they were basically victims as well. Having been loyal United customers for 30 years this sort of thing has become the norm over the last few years predictably unpredictable. They have lost our business.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;"I flew with United for the first time back in June/July flying non-stop on the new service between Edinburgh and Chicago and on to Wausau. I was surprisingly impressed with everything the check-in was fine there was no delays and the ""Premium Access"" (speedy boarding) was worth it. The entertainment options on the way out were of a good choice (by my standards) and sneakily ordering a special meal meant I got fed first (and it was still hot). Think it was chicken and something pretty good by economy standards. The seat was comfortable and obviously for the person in front of me to as she decided to recline her seat for the whole flight but I guess the fact of a spare seat beside me overcame the fact. I was slightly nervous about having to navigate Chicago as after reading reviews I thought it was going to be awfully daunting but everything was quick like seriously only 10 mins in the immigration line extremely impressed with that. Also sneaking into premium access and security at terminal 1 was an added bonus. I had a scheduled stop over of six hours but United decided to double it to 12 as the plane taking me to Wausau was delayed due to weather which I will say not entirely United's fault but some food and drink tokens would not of gone un-noticed. The flight home was all on time and everything went as planned. Thank you United you have impressed me I will be flying this airline again.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-17;I travelled business class from Taipei to Boston via San Francisco. The appetizer had unidentifiable meat on it that was so leathery I couldn't even chew it. The roll was as hard as a rock. The toddler in a seat near me made a lot of noise. I usually travel economy and tolerate all of this. When you pay for business class you shouldn't have to tolerate any of this. I arrived in San Francisco and there is a four hour delay on my flight to Boston due to an engine failure on the plane originating in Washington D.C. So I got on an earlier flight but have to travel economy class. I asked the agent to if she could help reimburse me for the difference between economy and business. She said I have to do it by myself online. Hassle after hassle after hassle.;NEGATIVE

We didn't take off for a few minutes but I assumed that a few minutes delay was normal. The captain walked in next and announced that the ""tyre pressure was low"". After some conversation with the maintenance crew at the airport the captain announced that they will have to deplane us. My thoughts at that point were - why wasn't it looked at before the previous crew left the aircraft? Or afterwards? They kept intermittently announcing that the flight would take off now and then and so on. But eventually 6 hours after we first boarded the plane the flight was cancelled. The crew expressed helplessness - we can't blame them. The airline staff were also helpful in rebooking but it was a lesson - a significant one in my life and I'll certainly think a hundred times before choosing United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-13;I flew several internal US flights with my family May 2014. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of seating and the service. United is absolutely a cheap airline operating cattle trucks in the sky. The cabins are rammed full with very little space the seating is dreadful the customer service a joke and the mighty dollar king. I am only surprised the toilets were not charged for. The baggage handling was terrible. It is truly amazing that this airline has gone so far downhill.;NEGATIVE

Once we were on a flight that day the flight attendant reported to us that there was no bad weather and had no idea why our flight was cancelled. We were then sent to Houston airport where they got us on a flight to fly into Miami where our next flight could not leave until the next morning so we spent the night on the floor at the Miami airport. The experience to our destination was horrible flying United and their express flights. Once we were returning home on United they did not tell us we did not have to pay for our luggage again and let us pay again Once again the flight was unpleasant. Once we arrived into Houston our flight home was delayed again the experience with United Airlines was horrible and the flight attendants were very unfriendly. I will never fly United again.;NEGATIVE

The stewards and stewardesses were prompt with service and very friendly. Seat-back inflight entertainment provided me with many options to kill the 7.5 hour flight. The meal was good for an airplane meal and they were generous with drinks making numerous coffee/soda/water runs. The flight wasn't full and I was able to actually sleep on an international flight which made me happy since I had no one sitting next to me. We left Newark on time and arrived in Geneva on time. They got me there safely and cheerfully. What else can I ask for?;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-13;"Like many people I flew United because of the great service I used to receive when Continental was still around. After the merger United seems to actually try to become the worst airline in United States history! On my last 4 trips United was responsible for 6 flights. Out of the 6 5 had major issues. The first trip had two legs. The first flight was delayed 1.5 hrs because the pilots couldn't show up on time. That caused me to miss my connecting flight by 3 minutes. Because the connecting flight was missed they booked me on the next flight (after an hour wait in the Customer Service line at O'Hare). Well the next flight was delayed nearly 3 hours - 1.5 of which was on the tarmac! On the return trip I checked in to my LAX-ORD flight only to find out my seat had been canceled. After arguing with the ticket counter agent that I indeed paid to be on the flight they finally called their reservations department. They in turn told me that I cancelled the flight. After more arguing they finally conceded that my seat may have been ""accidentally canceled"" by the ORD customer service. Finally on my last connection from ORD-ATW I sat around for over 5 hours because the aircraft that was supposed to take the route was late coming in. Really? It's Chicago O'Hare airport United's biggest hub! They couldn't pull another ERJ-145 into service? I could have driven to ATW and back (probably should have) in the amount of time I waited for the delayed aircraft. Despite having been a loyal Continental customer for over a decade I will not be flying United again in my lifetime.";NEGATIVE

I was not sure if we were locked into our package itinerary and would have to buy new tickets to get home so I called United's Customer Service. I advised them of our situation and the need to go home. There staff told me not to worry and assured me they would get us back in time for the funeral.

united-airlines;2014-07-13;Flew from SLC to DFW with my two toddlers. Our first flight from SLC-Houston was delayed about 40 minutes which gave me 20 minutes to get on my flight in Houston to DFW. I gate checked my stroller so I could use it to get from one flight to the next. After our flight I waited for the stroller and it never came. A baggage worker approached me and told me that he couldn't bring my stroller up because it had a white tag when it needed the pink tag. I told him that I needed to get to a flight that was leaving in 20 minutes. He was nice and offered to get the stroller onto my next flight. I trusted he would and ran to our next flight dragging my two screaming kids with me. We barely made it before it took off. When we landed in DFW I again waited at the gate for my stroller. It never came. I again dragged my two toddlers across the airport to baggage claim. The stroller still wasn't there. I eventually found the stroller without anyone's help. I will not fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-08;Our flight from Anchorage was to depart around 8.35 or so but delayed 2 hours due to electrical issues. Repairs made and flight was smooth and safe. But this put many people into flux because of missed connections. Houston airport was a total mess with people milling around and scrambling for standby options. We had a package of frozen fish we did not care to lose. We would approach the podiums for standby only to be advised the flight was already overbooked. On top of that many flights did not have a crew on the ground and had to await arrival on yet another messed up flight. I feel for the employees. Some were very nice and helpful but many but totally burned out and fighting with each other. This is a nasty situation and I encourage another airline at the moment.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-08;On the way to our destination they wouldn't accommodate my family (5) since we missed our connecting flight due to a delay on their part. It took us over 24 hours to reach the east coast which normally takes 6 hours flying. On the way back they gave away my paid for ticket that I purchased 2 months in advanced to someone who bought it 2 hours before. They re-booked me on the same flight with my family and only to find out once I boarded it was double booked. They also misplaced our luggage and left it in Newark New Jersey when we live in California.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;Worst travel experience ever. Travelling with two young kids not given seats together on flights from YVR to IAH and IAH to Tampa even after calling Customer Service before the flight. Flight to IAH was late resulting in missing connection to Tampa. Had to stay in IAH for 6 hours with two kids and Customer Service did not appear to care or want to help. UA has the worst customer service and do not listen to their customers.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;I flew UA Spokane WA to Denver CO and flight staff were late for work so slight delay. Plane was crowded but staff pleasant. Got to Denver landed at Gate B1 and had to run to Gate B95 because I had 5 mins to catch my next flight also UA. Finally got to my gate to find it was changed and there was a delay for half an hour. This turned into a two hour delay as they kept extending it. Plane was very crowded and tiny seats staff were friendly enough served cold coffee. I was lucky as everyone I sat with had a UA flying horror story. All in all it could have been worse. I thought staff being late was rather tacky. I think I will fly Delta next time.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;Our United flight DCA-ORD (direct) was cancelled and finally we arrived to Chicago 12 hours later flying via New York. Very bad information from staff. Only 4 days later another United flight from Chicago to Frankfurt was delayed more than 2 hours and we lose our flight connection to Barcelona. Entertainment and service on board was very poor. We've flown with many airlines from five continents and United is the worst in service. We cannot recommend this airline.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;UA 39 from OSL to EWR 23 June and UA 38 from EWR to OSL 29 June 2014. The plane was on route both directions (OSL-NYC return). The cabin staff made our flight very pleasant. Of course there is not much space in economy seat but it turned out to be manageable.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;We flew from Birmingham UK to Newark USA (Washington to Las Vegas San Francisco/Newark and then back to Birmingham middle of May and United were brilliant. Seats reserved as requested on all flights so no stress there. A bit more legroom would be good especially when passengers recline their seats usually not necessary. No delays all staff especially those on board very pleasant and most helpful on all flights. Food served was pretty good water offered throughout the various flights. All baggage looked after nothing lost or delayed. A good airline keep it up.

united-airlines;2014-07-06;Flight 63 July 4 2014. We had a full coach with no functioning bathrooms! I found out from one of the FA's that the flight came to Madrid from Washington with the forward bathroom already broken and the service crew didn't bother to fix it. Mid flight the second bathroom got irreparably jammed because of over use and lack of water. Of the last one soon followed. What sort of management runs a company like that. United will soon have the reputation that Aeroflot had back in the eighties. We will never travel with United again and that after twenty years of loyalty.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-06;I am a Premier Silver member on United. I am on the verge of switching airlines for future travel due to the horrible experience I'm having. I used miles to book a ticket from Sao Paulo to Chicago. They cancelled the flight (UAL 844) on July 1 (apparently weather in Chicago) again (UAL 844) on July 2 and automatically rebooked me on a flight on July 4 with a connection through Washington D.C. There has been zero communication from United except for an automatic rebooking email. Hundreds of travelers are now stranded at a Holiday Inn on the outskirts of Sao Paulo Brazil. I will be stranded in Sao Paulo for four extra days! I consistently attain Premier Silver status and always defend United when other customers complain of how bad an airline it is. Since I fly out of Chicago O'Hare I know I have other options in terms of airlines. I do not even know if I will make it out on July 4. The hotel we are at has provided no information to any of the customers in terms of what is the next step. As United increases capacity to try to build revenue they need to not forget about what matters the most: the customer. If this is not resolved to my satisfaction I will be taking my business to American Airlines (or elsewhere).;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-07-03;"I switched from Southwest airlines 5-6 years ago. Logged around 180K miles since joining Continental/United. A while back I used most of my balance of miles to reward myself with a trip to Vegas for me and my wife. First Class there and coach back. Purchased at least a month in advance checked in the day before received tickets with our seat assignments while checking our bags. So far so good. At the gate they informed us that United overbooked First Class-still plenty of seats on plane-just overbooked First Class-not sure how you do that-since the odds of ""no shows"" happening with FC seats has to be rare. I understand overbooking the plane but not a section. We were told since we did not purchase the tickets with money we were the lucky losers. Someone gave up their seat which put my wife in first class and me in the back. Five years of loyalty resulted in a final reward of getting split up to start our vacation. The image of my wife crying at the gate will forever remind me of how United rewards their customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-03;United Flight San Fran to Sydney due to depart at 10.20pm July 1st. Late away from the gates. Over 2 hours on the runway - a disruptive passenger means we have to return to the gate so that she can be removed by police. We are then told that we are not allowed to depart at all that evening and have to get off the plane. Went to customer service with all 350 other people. Queue to get a hotel voucher and new tickets for 25 hours later. Queue to get the shuttle. Finally in a hotel in the middle of nowhere at 3am. 25 hours of my life gone - disgraceful communication from United. Passenger was already behaving badly in the airport bar before departure.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-03;"I have been flying UAL for nearly 30 years now but I increasingly find them to be worse and worse. I have written to them twice now to protest their terrible baggage policies that encourage people to game the system and bring large heavy luggage to the gate so that they can get it on for free rather than paying for checking. This means long delays and dangerous conditions on board as people try to lift bags that are too heavy for them over the heads of other passengers putting them in danger. Indeed this last flight I took a direct hit on my head from a passenger's backpack that was too heavy for her. No attendant came to see if I was safe and uninjured. Attendants told me they could not announce that passengers should be careful of other passengers when loading luggage because it would be a ""deviation from the script"" and get them in trouble. This is no longer an airline that I can say puts the client first.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-03;My family and I flew United from Austin TX to Portland ME on June 30th. Or at least we tried to fly into Portland. We boarded our flight in Austin and arrived to Chicago with no problems. In Chicago we boarded our connecting flight but were told we were going to have to sit on the runway for a while because of the thunderstorms going on. About 30 minutes later we had to deplane for our safety. When we got off the plane we discovered numerous flights had been canceled due to weather. About 15 minutes later they got us back on the plane and told us we just had to fuel up and that they were going to get us to Portland that night. So then we waited out the weather for 6 hours and finally it was clear enough to take off at midnight. However one of the flight attendants timed out right when we were about to push back from the gate at midnight so they canceled it and told us to go wait in the customer service line to rebook. The line stretched over 10 gates and wasn't really helping any customers. Called customer service instead and was told there were no flights from Chicago to Portland until 3 days later and the best they could do for us was fly us to Hartford Connecticut - a 4 hour drive from Portland. Told our luggage would be sent to our destination Portland and would be waiting for us once we drove there. When we finally arrived in Portland at 6pm 24 hours after we were supposed to 3/4 bags hadn't even arrived. They have lost my family as customers.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-01;In the last month I and my family have flown United four times. Three of the four flights were unmitigated disasters causing terrible disruptions in our plans and incredible inconvenience. To make matters worse it seems as if United is totally focused on the passenger bearing all the downside to their poor execution. We got off a cancelled flight in Chicago ay 12.30 am and were greeted with nothing more than a toll free number to call for help. Not only the most pathetic customer service I've seen for an airline but the worst service I can recall for any business I've been associated with. I will fly United from now on only as a last resort.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-01;Flew UA1453 on June 29 2014 from Dulles to Seattle. Worst experience ever. Took 90 minutes to check bags. Flight left 3 hours late. Had to board twice. They had to reassign seats for four different families with little kids because they didn't get seated together when issued tickets. Had to unload because they had a flat tyre. Apparently they don't check things like that before loading planes. Watched Laurel and Hardy change the tyres. Missed my connecting flight in Seattle (of course).;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-01;"Flight from New Orleans LA to Houston Texas delayed multiple times due to weather. Frequent gate changes plus delays required interaction with agents required to arrange connecting flights. 3 times waited in line for over an hour. One agent actually yelled at us about ""why didn't we all just call the reservations line?"" Which of course we were all trying to do but could not get through. I ended up spending the night at the Houston airport. I asked United personnel if I could get a blanket and pillow and was told they did not have any. However the next morning on another Untied concourse there were at least a dozen people on cots - with pillows and blankets! I also was unable to get anything to eat or drink as all of the businesses in the airport seemed to close at 10pm and we arrived at ~ 10.03. I am diabetic and have MS (had not eaten since 9am) and was unable to get any United personnel to help me out with this matter. I remain appalled at the lack of customer service and professionalism of United's staff.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-01;June 25 2014 - flight delayed in Norfolk Virginia due to high winds at our destination. Not enough personnel to assist travelers at the counter. Computers were not operable. Attendant repeatedly assured us we were next in line but continued to help other people. After a 45 min wait another attendant arrived and made every effort to help but it was too late. Spent night at airport since local hotels were booked. Passengers were given a blanket and told to look for a place to sleep. Airport was extremely cold and loud music played all night. Witnessed the treatment from a United Supervisor towards a passenger at the Customer service counter - rude! Prior to this ordeal we attempted to change flight one day earlier but refused to pay the $200 - $300 per ticket. This was our second experience with United and were told that since they were purchased/merged with Continental the customer service has declined. Will try to avoid flying with them until this is corrected.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-07-01;The trip from Little Rock to Moline was fairly uneventful except for a delay due to weather in Chicago. That is understandable. However the return trip from Moline to Little Rock was a complete disaster! Our flight from Moline to Chicago was delayed for crew time-out. Really? Our flight had been scheduled for over 2 months. Surely that is enough time to prepare for an available crew. Naturally even though we ran as fast as we could not easy for 60+ year old people we missed our connecting flight. Then we spent another 2 hours waiting in line to find another airline. Not allowed to mention lost luggage. Horrible experience.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-06-25;Flew IAH-DFW on June 11 as first leg to onward travel to Frankfurt on United Ticket but second leg operated on Lufthansa (business). Flight was delayed plane change and gate change. Had no access to United Club even with International Business Ticket in Houston. Reason was that my flights would have to be business all the way through final destination but E145 has no business. Barely made my connection in DFW. Reasons above are easy to fix but I guess not intended to. Why not make your customers happy. Work hard Fly right? Staff were nice and friendly and tried to make up for the delay and no access policy. Summary nice Staff but more and more 'unfriendly' policies.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-25;A very old 737-700 was used on this 5-hour flight from Washington D.C. To Vancouver. The first class seat although spacious is very drab. The whole cabin has a very utilitarian design with nothing that says flying with United is an exciting experience. I have to say though that elements of the experience have improved over the last few years. A cloth hot towel has been re-introduced and even though they ran our of food items in the first class cabin the breakfast selection was good. Besides a scrambled eggs option they had a healthy oat bran choice as well that I really enjoyed. Moreover they also came by during the flight with a fruit basket. Great to see healthy food options being provided. Reminder: don't sit in the last row of the cabin like I did as the seat doesn't fully recline back.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-25;Flew PEK-ORD (flight 850) and ORD-MSP (flight 597) on Monday June 23. United often gets a bad reputation but overall I was very happy with my flights. Flight 850 left on time and arrived early in Chicago. The plane was clean the in-flight entertainment had a great selection of movies and TV shows and the crew were very friendly and helpful. The only problem I have with United's international flights is the lack of free beer and wine in Economy Class. Flight 597 to MSP boarded on time but then we sat on the tarmac for 50 minutes before we were given clearance to leave. Once we did finally take off the rest of the flight was fine. I'm a very happy United customer and would recommend this airline to anyone. While United's CEO is trying to cut costs and is devaluing the airline the flight crew and gate agents still work hard to give customers a great flying experience.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-25;Flew UA 319 Global First last night connecting from Austrian Airlines and was looking forward to experiencing UA's Global First on their three class 777 as I rarely ever fly UA. Horrible experience. Started with denying us access to the Global First Lounge as we were on Aeroplan miles even though their website says flying in Global First grants access to the lounge. They sent us three rail stops away to the Lufthansa Business Lounge so we could shower after the 10 hour+ flight from Vienna. The Gate Area was a mess with over 300 people crammed into a small area lining up like cattle in divided rows for 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 lanes - worse then Southwest. The plane came in late. We had to move to another Gate Area from C12 to D3 for another aircraft. The second Gate Area was larger. After a 1 hour and 38 minute delay we took off. Despite only 8 seats in Global First they don't get to board first. You must wait in Lane 1. Seems like an odd policy. The seats and cabin are very nice no complaints. The video/audio choices extensive except the screen is a little small compared to other carriers. For a transcon the drink/meal service stunk. The flight attendants were pleasant but UA offers no menus no champagne a tiny nut dish of peanuts and almonds limited food choices (chicken or pasta) all served at once on a plastic tray. The quality of food was poor. The sundae was very nice. Now I understand why United is having such a difficult time. They need to check out what other US carriers are doing.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-25;"Flew from Hong Kong to San Fran and around the US in late May. I am not a fussy flyer at all and can usually go to sleep easily. I am also an Aussie meaning I am used to the 'service' Qantas provides. However after my experience with United I am going to go easy on Qantas. I'll start my review with - ""wow"". It actually takes more effort than less to be as terrible as United. From the no entertainment system on-board (standard I'm told on a 12 hour flight) terrible food (I live in Asia and I know what bad food is) multiple gate changes (5 in total in 1 hour) and 2 hour delay (no apology). Then there was the possibly the rudest individuals I've ever met posing as flight attendants. I am not sure who employed these folk or why on earth they decided to work in the service industry but they were not only dismissive cold and patronising towards guests they actually made the whole flight a tense and uncomfortable environment. In summary I don't understand UA's play. They act like a low’ cost airline. I say 'low low' because the majority of low cost airlines play in the mid tier now. As a national carrier I don't understand this. They can't beat Southwest so you'd think service would be a priority. Manners are free last time I checked. Once again it takes more effort to be that terrible then it would to provide a half decent service. They are too many alternatives to put yourself through a UA experience. The most interesting part of this is all they have to do is look at Qantas and others who behaved like this in the late 90s and ended up losing half of their market share and have been struggling since. Your people are your business.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-25;We have flown with a number of other airlines both internationally and domestic and flying United was a nightmare. Weather is out of everyone's control but management of the overall system is a disaster and not equipped on the front line to deal with flight problems. We normally fly in and out of MSP but United ORD on the surface offered better options for connections to and from Toronto. The problems in Chicago from what information we managed to get (mostly from other passengers both on our flight and other flights) were they did not know where aircraft crews were where the planes were coming and going or what gate (we were moved 3 times-one of which was on the opposite end of the terminal). We have had less delays and problems flying out of MSP in brutal winter weather. They make no announcements and changes are not posted timely and if you can't get an audience with very limited counter agents you find out your flight has been cancelled when the boarding time has come and gone. We witnessed that time and again. We were rebooked on the same flight 24 hours later-and as expected no luggage when we arrived-the tracking showed the time and place it was checked in more than 24 hours earlier at ORD-no progress up the chain in over 24 hours. I honestly feel for the counter people who have to deal with the chaos and irate passengers with little information and resources to fix problems-no wonder they may be less than friendly at times. I do believe there are huge and unnecessary internal problems with this airline (or airport) because we have flown from coast to coast foreign countries and very bad weather with other airlines (and airports) that managed to deal with flight problems in a more efficient and passenger friendly manner. Who cares about the free soda with no ice - it would appear United-ORD has much much bigger problems.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-23;We flew LGA-DEN-LAX in United First. Were able to use the United Clubs in both La Guardia and Denver as we were continuing on an international flight from LAX on a Star Alliance Carrier. Pleasant check-in agent checked our bags direct through to Brisbane which saved us having to collect luggage in Los Angeles. First leg on A319 with only 8 in the first cabin was fantastic. One of the best FAs we have ever encountered. Food was very good and drinks flowed freely. Only gripe on this sector was lack of in flight entertainment. The aircraft was equipped with Wi-Fi but you had to pay to use it even in the first class cabin. Not much positive to write about the second leg on B737-900. One food option offered. If you didn't want it too bad. Not even offered a snack from the buy on board menu. Once service was over the FAs sat in the galley and proceeded to talk extremely loudly for the rest of the flight.

Like all my previous experiences flying on United not only does the flight board beyond the stated time we pull out of the gate 40 minutes late only to be told while sitting on the runway that we are going to be held 30 minutes in our position. It's bad enough that the seats are extremely small now we're delayed over 1 hour total which causes issues with our connections.

united-airlines;2014-06-23;I recently completed 3 trips on United DEN-LGA and EWR-DEN with 5 out of 6 segments in First. Overall the product is decent for domestic first class. Crew on all 6 legs were generally very friendly and chatty with the passengers (all were DEN or SFO based). They worked the whole 4 hour flight and were constantly refilling glasses. Food was a little bland but was served well along with fresh baked cookies. Problem is inconsistency in on-board products with old CO aircraft having in seat TV and UA aircraft with old overhead monitors. Some aircraft's with WI-Fi and some without which makes it difficult to work. Of the 6 flights 3 were right on time with early arrivals and 3 were delayed 45 minutes mainly because of ATC issues in NYC area.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-23;In a recent long-haul flight (UA871) SFO-TPE business class again ran out of the Asian meal option. This occurred in 4 out of my 5 recent transpacific flights. The purser came and apologized. She said United loaded only four such meals into a business class that seats 44 passengers! With a destination that is Taipei it's astounding that United didn't bother to prepare more Asian food options. It seems to never happen when I fly Asiana Cathay Singapore or Lufthansa. It happens only on United. Is United hedging on meals to save money? And what is this 2-4-2 business class configuration? It's pretty bad given that for the same fare one can fly in a much more spacious environment on competing airlines. I wish United would dismantle these terrible seats.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;"SFO-CDG-SFO. Over the past couple of years I have had the opportunity to travel internationally on both United and several foreign carriers. United's First Class or Business First Class service and amenities are no better than those in economy on the foreign carriers. Outbound we didn't get drinks prior to take off as the flight attendants were spending way too much time chatting with the other passengers. The meals were satisfactory though I am getting a bit bored with the ice cream sundae. The inflight entertainment worked well though it would have been nice to have different choices on the return flight. The only thing United's front cabin had going for it was more comfortable seats than in the back of the plane however even that comes with a ""but"". On the 767 the pods next to the window have very limited room for your feet when in the flat position. The aisle seats do seem to have more room. I travel weekly for work so I will continue to fly United but if I were a leisure traveler without frequent flyer status I would choose another airline. (United treats it leisure passengers very poorly - they board last often have no bin space and are generally treated shabbily.) United barely lives up to its three star rating.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-06-20;I have flown this airline (on the way to Ukraine) twice in the past. This time I flew to Frankfurt Germany. Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Sheer incompetence to deal with cancellations. First they do not communicate them. Secondly the staff are rude and never apologizes for the inconvenience caused. Thirdly they are unable to get you onto other flights in a timely manner. How is my experience? I haven't been able to start my trip yet. A 48 hour delay so far. Two trips to the airport. Two hours on the phone. And six hours waiting in line to get a new flight plus two more to get the luggage that had already been checked in. I am trying to go on a vacation of seven days that has already been reduced to five after having paid over $3000. I am a seasoned air traveler and have had many flights cancelled in my life. But I have never come across such incompetence and rudeness. Never again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Travelled with United on 6 flights from 23/05/2014-08/06/2014 Heathrow to Las Vegas to Hawaii and back. On the 6 flights we were only fed two meals from Heathrow to Houston and Washington to Heathrow. We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy. I asked for a small bottle of water to be told that they did not have enough so could not give me one. They did serve enough drinks on the flights so what were they doing. I will never fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;We flew from IAD to BRU with United. (Boeing 777). Very nice cabin crew normal catering good flight. Flight was delayed but we got good information from the flight deck.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;We took a business class flight from London Heathrow to Houston Bush round trip. On the flight to Houston the video screen at my seat my wife's seat and several other seats did not work at all. The flight crew tried to fix it but couldn't. They promised to have someone contact us for some credit. Never heard from them. On the return flight the seat would not recline the movies continuously skipped there was no music available and the food was awful. Flight crew tried to fix it. No luck. Flying BA from now on.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Very poor quality service. Lack of in seat entertainment on 5 hour flights even in Business class is simply unacceptable in this day and age. I was also refused access to a lounge on an international business class seat because my son in a wheelchair was flying economy on a school trip. Basic customer service would have seen the airline allow us to enter the lounge.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Why is it that United is the only airline that cancelled a flight from Denver to Omaha due to weather but all the other airlines going to and from Denver only delayed? Of course because we are having poor weather they can blame it on the weather which means as a customer we cannot recoup anything from them and we have to then wait until a pm flight when we are scheduled on the first flight out of OMA. I wonder how many times this airplane has been cancelled in the last couple of weeks it sounds as if this airlines has an issue with mechanical problems and only wants to bandaid the problem. I am all for a company making money but not at the expense of the customers who are paying their bills!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;"I travel all the time for business and booked on United for cost reasons I was flying last-minute from LGA to MSP. I was scheduled to depart at 6pm from NY change planes in Chicago with an hour layover time and land in Minneapolis by 9.30pm. Departing flight was listed ""on time"". 5.45 boarding still had not begun - asked the gate attendant when we would be boarding since I had a connector. He informed me that they were about to delay the flight indefinitely. After advice from customer service that my original flight is unlikely to take off in time for me to make any connection in Chicago I am rebooked on a flight scheduled to depart an hour later - 7pm. However this means I will miss my O'Hare connection so that is also rebooked to a 10pm CDT flight. 7pm flight boards on time. Around the time of boarding the originally-scheduled 6pm flight also starts the boarding process. Chaos at the 7pm flight's gate as multiple irate businessmen who had changed out of their 6pm first- class seats for a time-saving economy seat on the 7pm scramble to articulate their outrage and get rebooked on the now-departing earlier flight. At 7.10pm the 7pm flight is finally loaded - and completely full. It's sweltering hot and ripe with body odor and very very dimly lit. 7.20pm: still hot still smelly still dark. Flight attendants are trying their best to be accommodating. The plane finally acquires a couple of pilots 45 minutes after scheduled departure. At this point I am getting nervous that I may miss my re-booked connector as well in which case I will either have to overnight in Chicago or drive the 6.5 hours to St. Paul. The plane touches down in Chicago only a little bit late despite the delay in take-off. Stopped on the runway in the middle of taxi - stops for at least 20 minutes. Flight attendant makes an attempt to ask passengers to remain seated so those with tight connectors can deplane first. His plea is denied immediately by the scores of tired and angry people who flood the corridor before the plane has even reached the gate. Fighting through 35 rows of people I manage to deplane with 10 minutes to spare before boarding call for the connection. Arrive sweaty and out of breath at the gate just as my phone brings up a text from United: flight is delayed until 10.30 because the plane hasn't arrived. The gate attendant changes the sign to read 10.45 instead. Once 1035 hits she updates it once more - to 10.51. In short she assures there is no possible way I will arrive before midnight (CDT). I will never be taking United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Flying EWR-NRT with Flight UA 79. Boeing 777. Punishing 14-hr flight in cramped seating condition. Everything about this plane is run down from seating to carpeting. Food is terrible and served in plastic tray covered with ripped aluminium foils. Breads are served out of bundles of plastic bags instead of bread baskets. What are we in jail? Ridiculous!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-20;Our trip from Quito Ecuador to Lincoln Nebraska was supposed to take 12 hours but included a four hour delay in Houston and a 9.5 hour delay in Denver. Weather was not the problem. United should have re-booked us when their mechanical failure and four hour delay was apparent in Houston. Ours was a 26 hour ordeal with many of those hours standing in line waiting for service and that was completely avoidable. What did they offer? A $7 food voucher.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-18;We flew from SFO to FRA and returned from OSL to SFO on UA. The service for these international flights was good the cabin staff helpful and professional and the flights on time. The seats in cheap economy were extremely cramped and offer little hope of rest. The flight over had a large contingent of passengers from the Indian subcontinent who did not take the hint to settle down and rest when the crew turned down the lights and yakked the night away oblivious to requests to quiet down. Not UA's fault but they could have been a bit more pro- active to settle these people back into their seats for the long flight.;NEGATIVE

Flight attendants were considerably older than other airlines and seemed to be worn out as evidenced by their indifferent and even sarcastic attitudes. Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes. The one saving grace for this United flight was the price which was significantly lower than other TPE-SFO non stops. So I guess you get what you pay for. Recommended for price but if you can afford it any of the Asian airlines offer better service.";POSITIVE

united-airlines;2014-06-16;What a shame a wonderful Airline like Air New Zealand code shares with United Airlines. After a wonderful flight with Air New Zealand from Australia we then flew business with United within the United States. The 6 hour flight between New York and Los Angeles was a nightmare. From the small old plane to the noise from where the stewards were working( they couldn't help the noise as the work area is so small). Not to mention the very small unclean toilet. None of United earphones seem to work (I now know why most people on the flight had their own). The whole flight was a nightmare. I will never fly United again or recommend them.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-16;"Our connection in San Francisco got cancelled due to aircraft maintenance. This was in the very early morning so there were no additional flights available for 5+ hours. After some research of the flight number that got cancelled this flight had been cancelled 2 additional times in the previous 3 weeks. That's one cancellation per week for this one aircraft. After we made it from San Francisco to LA for our re-route the LA flight was delayed an hour due to late aircraft arrival. Once we boarded we waited on the plane for 1 hour after everyone was boarded and settled in. Pilot originally said it was due to weather and admitted it was due to ""paper-work"" before takeoff. Unbelievable. We landed 8 hours after the original time we were told. United uses primarily outdated planes with no on-demand in-flight entertainment. When they do offer their on-demand entertainment like Live DirecTV it costs money. Long flights (7+) could offer good personal TVs but that is rare. Wifi is unheard of my flight months ago was promised wifi but once boarded they claimed the original plane had to be switched so no wifi. Customer service is atrocious also. We were offered $7 each for food at the airport we had to wait at but that's it. I know a friend who had two flights cancelled in the same night due to airline problems. As a MileagePlus cardholder much more is expected. When we tried to get upgraded on our re-routed flights the guy said ""Oh this is a mileage flight"". This is the worst American airline aside from Spirit Airlines. Fly JetBlue or Virgin America if possible.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-16;"I recently flew in the first class section of a United Airlines 757 from Orlando to Dulles (about a 2 hour flight). The only things to like is that I arrived promptly on schedule and my seat was larger than a coach seat. Otherwise there is absolutely no reason to fly first class on United domestically. I asked for a blanket and was told after some time that ""the supervisor said we don't stock blankets on flights from Florida"". Then less than 1 minute later a different flight attendant brought a large clear plastic bag full of blankets onto the plane and put them into a closet in first class! I'd just left Disney World and the contrast of the Disney quality of service versus United's was stark. I began to wonder if the safety and evacuation training for United employees is better than their customer service training otherwise you better hope you never need them!";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-16;"YYC-IAH-MUC in Y. As an Aeroplan Elite I got premier access check in and boarding which was greatly appreciated. I also like that United seems to be making an effort to control oversized carry-ons. As a result both flights even the full flight to Munich left with all bags in the cabin. Planes were comfortable and clean (A320 and 764) with adequate room for my 5'8"" self. Crews were generally fantastic a real surprise given United's reputation. I like United's boarding structure as it prevents a mad dash to board and worked very well making boarding easy and comfortable. Only gripe is food on 10 hour IAH-MUC flight- small dinner and then before landing a mini croissant and small fruit cup- This is what I usually get on YYZ-MUC but that is a 7 hour flight. I expected more on this longer route and can imagine that some larger passengers were quite hungry! Connection in IAH was also very easy no security screening required no bus or train either even though I had to change terminals. Very impressed!";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-13;I'm satisfied with my first couple of flights with United May-June 2014. I flew transatlantic EWR-Zurich and LHR T2-EWR I tried outbound on a premium plus seat for 125$ add on pretty comfortable. I'm only disappointed because I did not receive my special meal as requested the air hostess asked me to confirm with United's customer service centre next time. Otherwise arrived on time clean comfortable although too cold cabin. Good entertainment. I'm giving United also a good satisfaction rate because of 100% mileage earned on my loyalty program of another Star Alliance member.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-13;I was surprised at such a pleasant experience. We flew two US internal flights. The first was on time the second twenty mins late due to a minor technical fault. We were impressed with the monitors in the gate area showing available seating on the aircraft and probable departure time. We had no problem with carry on baggage. On the first flight people who had not checked in bigger bags were given labels and picked up their bags when they got off the plane. Plane was clean staff friendly coffee OK and the seat comfort was OK. No complaints - and I have to say I have suffered a lot worse.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-13;AMS-ORD 11 Jul. I had a most wonderful flight on United from Amsterdam to Chicago. The flight attendants were warm and made the experience one to remember. The flight departed and arrived on time. The new business class seats are great though I did not try the lie-flat option. I was in the pair next to the galley - fair warning the freezer compartment is next to the aisle seat and does make noise - need to wear your headphones. Food was great - had Thai chicken for main. However to repeat it was the flight attendants that made this flight one of the best I have experienced.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-13;This has been the worst travel experience I have had. My original flight was cancelled I was not informed of this until I arrived at the airport. This should be standard protocol to notify passengers that the flight is cancelled. On top of that the customer service is atrocious. As I was reasonably upset and asking customer service to find me another flight she tells me that the next flight to my destination is boarding now but you cannot get on it. They put me on a connecting flight to Chicago 4 hours later. 4 hours later all Chicago flights were delayed another 2 hours. Meanwhile flights are boarding all around me. I strongly advise you to stay as far away as possible from United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-13;"Leaving Newark yesterday the gate agent announced that ""all overhead bin room was full"" as boarding group 4 (out of 5) was beginning to board. They forced gate check of all carry-on bags for all the remaining passengers. On boarding there were tons of open overhead bins with room remaining including one right at my seat! Many people complained - the kind cabin steward explained that ""sometimes they just start gate checking toward the end because the bins are usually full at that point"". My bag was taken right outside the airplane door - the agent could have actually asked the first class cabin steward ten feet away if their walkie-talkies don't work. They added 30 minutes delay at the destination waiting for luggage unnecessarily for all those people? Why are advertising that we are allowed ""one carry-on bag and one personal item"" and flying planes that do not have enough space for them? On my last United flight they made me check my carry-on bag because it didn't easily slide into their sizer though it would have with a push and would easily fit overhead. United has adopted a new policy and attitude about baggage that is Draconian - they should be ashamed. I will not fly United even though they have the only non-stop flights to my most frequent destination.";NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-06-12;TXL-EWR-LAX in Y. Had wanted to take the 757 flight from Berlin to Newark since the route was opened up by Continental. Since the merger between the two airlines is far from complete I knew the crew would all be Continental and knowing how poorly the new United is perceived not just by customers but staff too the old- fashioned Continental Airlines flight bag I hauled out of the back of my closet scored me a glass of champagne as I passed through the forward galley en route to my economy seat. Left on time catering was decent (one area the new United hasn't yet cut to the bone) although movie choices were limited to new releases so I read my book and did some work. Immigration at Newark was relatively painless due to the early scheduled arrival time of 1200 beating the afternoon rush. Short visit to the United Club which is comfortable although the snack options are awful. For the second leg to Los Angeles found myself back at the gate I'd arrived at. Some infrequent fliers consider narrowbody hardware unsuitable for long haul as it is “cramped” or “claustrophic take it from someone who flew on the same 757 all the way from Berlin to LA the size of the seat is the same as the biggest planes (except 10-abreast 777s where it is considerably narrower) and the smaller numbers at boarding baggage claim and immigration mean small is beautiful. The second leg to California was quite decent enjoyed a chicken-and-blue- cheese wrap for sale and the view of the North American continent unfolding beneath our wing. Arrival into LAX was on-time and baggage delivery was prompt. No complaints – this time.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-12;I read the reviews of this airline and was terrified. However we flew San Antonio to Dulles and Dulles to Boston and we were impressed. OK so the leg room is not fantastic but its better than many. The plane was reasonably clean the staff friendly and the coffee drinkable. Furthermore the flight to Dulles was on time. The Boston one left about 20 mins late due to an error light re the toilet showing in the cockpit but again the plane was clean and the staff friendly and efficient. No complaints.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-12;My family and I flew United to Mexico for a wedding. We were scheduled to return to the United States on Monday 5/9/2014. Our scheduled flight was delayed 3.5 hours due to weather in Texas. This was understandable. The rest of this journey was not. In Mexico we were switched from our connecting flight due to the scheduled departure time. The flight we were switched to departed prior to our arrival at the Houston Airport. My family along with several others in our same situation then attempted to obtain another flight. The United personnel at the Houston Airport were very rude and not at all helpful. We spent over 16 hours in the airport with no blankets pillows or cots. I will never again fly United. The delays were one thing but the attitude of the employees was completely unacceptable.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-12;F class KOA-LAX. A warm crew was the bright spot in an extremely inferior product. Small tray with all courses at the same time followed by a cookie in a paper bag. For a 5 hour flight this is ridiculous. Hawaii routes are served with the oldest run down aircraft. Leg room is adequate but entertainment option is pathetic. For first class Hawaiian is the only way to go. United is just sad.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-10;UA1284 EWR-SFO 14 May 2014. No IFE or WiFi on a transcon? That's what I found when flying on brand new 737-900. I've flown UA's older -900s and they have DirecTV-okay you have to pay for it but it's still better than nothing. The flight itself was pleasant the new seats reasonably comfortable. One thing I've always liked about UA is that at least one flight attendant comes out every 30 minutes or so and has cups of water or the beverage cart coming around. But no entertainment? I could have flown Southwest they don't claim to have IFE on their flights.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-10;The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.;NEGATIVE

The trip was through a tour so the price or value cannot be determined. Security on Monday at O'Hare was very crowded so be sure to allot enough time. Boarding was organized and most bags were checked at the gate because the overhead bins would have been to crowded. The seats on board were very comfortable and recline was decent. The plane was an A319 that has not been reconfigured with the slimline seating. Crew was very nice and efficient and Inwas given an entire can of apple juice. We arrived at National Airport on time and the bags were very fast to come off of the carousel. The airport is very convenient to access downtown DC. Return was at BWI which is only 20 miles outside DC however traffic was a nightmare and it took almost an hour to get there. Gate agents at the airport were very friendly and efficient. Security is very smooth here and the airport is overall pleasant. Boarding was quick and the flight was operated by a 737-900ER. The seats were comfortable and no one bought the direct TV. Recline wasn't much which made sleeping difficult but I was not in economy plus. The crew on board were nice but not as good as others. The flight arrived on time and bags were quick to come out of the carousel. United seems like they are beginning to overcome merger issues now.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-05;"April 26 FLL-CLE. My friend flew with miles and I flew for $400. Not bad considering that it was booked 3 weeks in advance and during a popular travel time. Check in crew and gate agents at FLL are outstanding. So friendly and willing to help out. The check in crew were smiling and friendly and helped out with checked bag issue. The gate agent was the best I've seen. She was so helpful to the passengers in wheelchairs and kept everyone fully informed. The crew onboard were friendly and very attentive. Always asking customers if everything was ok and picked up trash frequently. Somehow the flight departed 40 minutes late due to there being only one operational runway in FLL. We didn't hear the captain inform us about it or speak once during the flight. The flight was completely full. The flight was on a A320 with the new slimline seats. The legroom was adequate for my height of 5' 10"" however the seat was very hard and didn't recline very far. I purchased the wifi and for $5 was a great deal. No music or overhead screens on this plane. Connection through Cleveland was very easy and the airport was very easy to connect through. Flight from CLE to ORD was 60% full and had another great crew. They were very enthusiastic. The flight was operated by a 737-700 with very comfortable seats. Not one person on board purchased the over priced direct TV. Flight arrived on time bags quickly arrived at carousel. Overall United was decent. A bit overpriced but was on time with friendly service.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-05;LHR-EWR and back. You do get what you pay for with this airline but they really should do something to improve on the overall quality of their planes and service. The 757s look extremely dated now - once white plastic fascias now looking grey/brown. Curtain divider between Economy and Business a tatty net curtain that doesn't cover the width of the doorway. On both flights the toilet illumination signs were flickering constantly and added to the air of shabbyness. The only long haul airline I have flown in the last 5 years where in Economy you do not get any inflight entertainment system. All you get is films on a loop. I had to wait 20mins for the loop to start again. Flew LHR-SFO last October and on the EWR-LHR route this time the same film selection was playing as in October. Particularly galling as I paid a cheaper price for a trip to Thailand on Thai Airways last year and the IFE was excellent. Staff whilst pleasant are genuinely uninterested took 10 mins to answer my call to ask them to get my bag out of the overhead locker as the passengers either side of me were asleep. You have to pay for the alcoholic beverages - $7 for a 125ml bottle of red wine is an unbelievable rip off. The seat was the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in with the exception of Ryanair where you expect an uncomfortable ride. On the plus side there is an extremely good availability of economy plus seats and the legroom really is superb in these seats but this does not make up for the overall comfort of the seat. The price to upgrade to Economy plus is the same as paying for an extra legroom seat on Virgin Atlantic and is less than half as good.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-06-05;Horrible experience. I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai. The plane was a tired creaky old B-777. Flight attendants whose average age was nearly 60 were grumpy and rude. Only a stale bagel was served. Definitely one of the worst flight experiences I had ever to endure.;NEGATIVE

Once on the plane we again had the same experience. The food was ok and served hot. The choice of films etc was great and to have the chance to charge your devices was very handy. On our return we were due to fly with a different airline but we missed our flights. The other airline couldn't care less and said we would need to pay $1300 each to get home. We decided to go over to the United desk to see if they could offer any help. They went above and beyond to help us get on another flight with a different company for no charge.;POSITIVE

We were bumped from one customer service desk to another. The line at Gate 71 never moved for an hour. Children were tired and screaming while the customer service reps mumbled useless statements waited for phone returns and after an hour declared we had no hotel or meal compensation because DIA coded the departure as late due to ""weather"". If the plane had been ready at departure time there would have been no delay. The rude and helpless reception at Los Angeles resulted in several of us sleeping in the airport all night missing a full day of reserved vacation time a change in destination from Hilo to Kona a change in car rental arrangements and a long drive around the island instead of 30 miles as originally planned. The scene at the customer service desk was hellish and I was prepared to see any one of the passengers leap across the counter at the inept and uncaring mumbling representatives.

united-airlines;2014-06-04;June 3 EWR-SFO Economy on a new 737-900. We departed two hours late due to a storm and flight crew distributed water and was generally helpful and good humored. These planes offer standard economy seating not as comfortable as other planes United flies. Bathrooms are extremely tiny and cramped. As opposed to a wide variety of seatback entertainment on UA's 757s from JFK to California this new 737-900 offer no entertainment options at all a major disappointment on such a long flight. These planes may be perfect for a 1-2 hour trip but not for a transcontinental journey.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-03;London LHR - Newark EWR. Boeing 757-200 quite old and it was visible everywhere as cabin looked shabby. Cabin crew ok but limited their service to distributing food collecting trays and that's it. Small portions paid alcoholic drinks torn inflight magazine. Nothing special there are much better options on this route.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-06-02;We flew UA893 SFO to ICN on B747 on 29th May 2014. Flight was delayed 2 times - captain rejected the first plane due to technical issue and the replaced plane returned to gate after found technical glitch while taxiing. Overall almost 5 hours delay. The captain tried his best to kept us updated on the delays. Instruction of allowing passengers to leave the plane during the delay was not clear resulted in passenger wandering around the bridge area. Cabin crew changed after the 2nd delay which turned out to be a plus point to us. Original crew serving the upper deck was grumpy the replacement crew (original crew gone probably due to extended hour) was fantastic provided one of the better quality service to a almost fully filled business class cabin. The plane was old and there was sign of dirt especially around the edges of the window frame. Seat itself was comfortable. It is weird to see UA cramping 2-4-2 seat in business class. Food was delicious. Inflight entertainment was average. For the price paid UA has exceeded our expectation.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-29;ORD to LHR in a fully refurbished 767-300ER. Efficient and helpful check in. Nice lounge was very busy but had nice atmosphere and nice bar tenders. Boarding efficient. Very good seating notwithstanding 6 abreast and good cabin ambience. Some pairs of seats are backwards facing but not a big issue. Professional and helpful crew who were well organised attentive and efficient - a real surprise. Very good choice of wines and OK food but nice desert and very good cheese plate. Seat in sleeping position was good and nice large pillow. Big screen noise reduction earphones and OK programming with mostly American content. Many language options. Luggage return quick. Overall very impressed and would consider better than transatlantic AC and LH flights taken in previous 3 weeks.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-28;Six hour delay from San Antonio to Houston. I could have driven there and back. The flight crew and gate staff were so rude! No recompense whatsoever. Not even an apology to the over two hundred passengers. My first time to fly with United and my last.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-28;1st class UA 926 LHR-EWR in 3 cabin 767. Check in with Biz class pax long line. Indifferent contract staff were clueless regarding arrival facilities at EWR. Ditto for gate agents. Flight attendant told me to check with transfer desk at EWR after clearing customs. Transfer agent told me that there were no arrival facilities unless continuing on with UA. Huh at a UA hub for 1st class? I noticed that meal served in 1st was the same as in Biz albeit with better china. Altogether a thoroughly mediocre experience for a huge premium price. There are many better ways to cross the pond - especially those of us needing to freshen up for post arrival meetings.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-27;ORD-AMS on a clapped out Boeing 767 which showed its age. The worst experience on this flight were the cabin crew. The most unfriendly lazy rude and uninterested crew I have ever flown with. Shouting at passengers to close the overhead lockers refusing to close these themselves. This is one of their safety duties! The service was slow no peanuts/snacks with the drinks. Dinner was awful cold by the time I was served and totally inadequate for a 7 hr flight. Beer/wine are for sale only and when I asked for a soft drink they offered water only! A second request for a soft drink was rudely refused. Inflight entertainment was terrible small screens and all channels started without any announcement so by the time you wanted to watch anything films were already running for 30 mins. I am a Star alliance Gold member and have flown more than most people but this flight was by far the worst I have ever experienced. No more United for me!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-27;I booked a 5 day weekend from Thursday to Tuesday. My flight was cancelled while I was on my way to the Airport. I had to pay for a taxi to and from the airport and return the next day at 4am for a 6am flight. My original flight was a 2 hour direct flight from Newark to Atlanta but the rescheduled flight had a layover in Chicago. I arrived in Atlanta at 12pm. I could have leave with that but I could not believe that my return flight was cancelled and this time without a notice. I only found out because I couldn't print my boarding pass. I was rescheduled on a flight to LaGuardia and because the agent did not completed the booking I missed the flight and had to be put on another flight 3 hours later. I got to the airport at 5.45pm and did not take off until 10.53pm for a 2 hour flight. I am still waiting for an explanation for cancelling both flights.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-27;Louisville - Houston - Denver - Reno. All flights on time. Plenty of drink runs on all flights. Snack boxes for purchase but I did not try any. All the staff were friendly except for a grumpy check-in clerk at Louisville. My check-in bag was 54.5 lbs so was asked to remove an item. I pulled out one slipper and that dropped the weight down to 54 lbs and that was acceptable according to the clerk. I asked her if she was serious and she said yes. So I put one slipper in my carry on and went on my way. Flew on an EMB175 from Louisville to Houston which was way to small of a plane for that distance but I pretty much slept the whole flight. Then was on a 787 Dreamliner from Houston to Denver. Thought that was kind of a big plane for that flight but what a brilliant aircraft. New quiet and very comfortable. The plane was heading to Tokyo from Denver hence the need for the large craft. Then an A320 on to Reno. Everything went like clockwork so no complaints and my luggage arrived safely minus the slipper I had to take out in Louisville.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-27;May 17th from Toronto to Cancun with a connection in Houston. The plane had a mechanical problem half way to Houston and had to land in Memphis. More than 100 people were asked to stay at Memphis airport and wait for another plane to come. We waited for 7 hours from 1.30 to 8.30. The airport staff first said that the plane would come at 7.30 and later announced that it would be one hour late. All stores in Memphis airport closed around 6.30 and we were all starving. United did at least bring some food for us in this situation. We missed our connecting flight and had to call our hotel and pick-up shuttle to explain the situation. We eventually arrived at Houston around 11pm. There were only 2 people at Houston to help the customers arrange hotels and airport shuttles and they worked extremely inefficiently since they didn't seem to know what to do. In the end it took them 3 hours to get everyone arranged. Up to this point I am totally disappointed with United Airline. I'd rather pay a little more to get a better service. This is my first time flying with United and shall be the last.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-26;"Long story short they kept finding reasons to delay and cancel my flights and those of the people around me. It was chaos and passengers all around were complaining of their own horror stories with United. I spent the night in a Chicago airport (admittedly a large part of my nightmare was O'Hare airport) and no one who worked there for United seemed to care that I needed a flight out because they were so overwhelmed with the number of flights that were canceled and people that needed to be rebooked. They didn't give me a hotel room because the problem was due to ""weather"" but that was simply not true. They told us on the plane that we boarded that we needed to go back to the airport because the crew had overworked their permitted number of hours and they had no other crew to replace them with. I told them I would literally take any flight that would get me out of that city and the flight I did get was canceled within a few hours of booking it. I went back to customer service and I felt like I was a bother to them for simply needing a way out of there to avoid sleeping on their floors again. It was like it was normal for them to have upset customers and the people like me who didn't give them a hard time were more likely to messed about.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-26;IAH to YYC on Boeing 737-800. Smooth check-in. Organized boarding. Clean aircraft decent seat and legroom. Pro-active crew and multiple offerings of beverages. Bags on baggage belt by the time I arrived there.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-25;BOS-IAH. I was traveling with my family for holiday from BOS-LAX via IAH. My son is severely allergic to nuts and we always carry Epipen with us. We informed United customer service agent in advance about the allergy they made a note in system and advised us to inform the crew on board. When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement. After take off they did announce in so low volume that no one really could hear anything. More than 3 million people in the United States report being allergic to peanuts tree nuts or both. I would like to warn those people in advance about the United Nut Policy.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-25;EWR-PVG on a 777-200. Economy Plus exit window seat. Was able to get this seat without paying for it due to a bug in the online seat map (otherwise it would be an extra $192). Overall it was a satisfying flight given I only paid a little above 600 dollars for this non-stop flight which would usually be over 900. The food was standard but not very adequate. There were friendly flight attendants but some were very rude and indifferent. Entertainment was ok but the system was sluggish. The headset did not work but I was able to use my own earphones. Lavatories were not very well maintained and I didn't see any flight attendant clean it during the entire flight. However all these negative aspects were overpowered by the price and the free exit window seat. Would definitely fly them again.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-24;All week long flying with our three year old we have preboarded the planes. Well upon boarding a flight that need I say arrived two hours late with United we were told to get in the back of the line with her as they have voided the children board first policy as of this weekend. He was rude about telling us and made it embarrassing as if we were doing something so wrong we were doing what we are used to doing not to mention we didn't just try to be the very first we actually got in line up 2 just because we weren't in any hurry to board. After all we all leave at the same time right? After waiting almost 4 hours at the airport with a toddler because of a delayed flight that's not how to really brighten someone's day and treat them. Maybe if you want to change a policy like that again and be butts about it at the gate be sure everyone is aware of your new stupid rule!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-24;"After having a confirmed reservation to Buenos Aires in first class for three months before the flight for which I used miles - I'm a million mile plus flyer - I was bumped from first class and sent back to row 30 (on a 767) because United had oversold the flight and other passengers had paid more money for their tickets (not used miles). The seats in economy are among the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced. The United staff - who were long time Continental employees - were very embarrassed and said it should never have happened. And of course it should not have. A deal should be a deal or the airline should warn people in advance that their accumulated miles which they tout as being very valuable are really not so valuable and can become worthless if the airline chooses. When I complained after the flight United's response was essentially ""too bad"".";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-24;This experience has been disgusting. I was flying from Newark NJ to London to grab a connecting flight to get to Dublin. The original flight was delayed 3 hours which wouldn't be so bad if someone would have properly advised us about the following connection. Due to the total lack of communication I proceeded to miss my connecting flight because United failed to give me the information I needed to make it on time. I will never fly with this airline again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-24;"Flew out of SFO an hour and a half late. Got to Houston only to find out my flight to Huntsville had been cancelled. I go to the ""customer service"" desk to be put on another flight. The only one she says is available is the 4 o clock flight the next day but I can get on standby for the 10:30 am flight. I ask her if I'll get reimbursed for the hotel room I'll have to get. She says United doesn't reimburse for weather and then tells me I won't be able to find a hotel room because there is a conference in Houston and there are no hotel rooms available but I can sleep in the airport. She also complains to me that everyone is taking it out on them and it's not fair. I proceed to tell her it's also not fair that my flight was cancelled and that they won't reimburse me for a hotel room or food or taxi fare. When I went back through security I was told I was not able to re-enter the airport because my flight wasn't until the next day. I ended up finding a hotel room and thanks to my mom calling travelocity I got on the 1030am flight. I ended up cancelling my flight back to SFO on United and booked it with American.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-23;I really was disappointed. Leaving Milwaukee no flight crew. One and a half hours late leaving stand in line for two hours to get connecting flight changed airplane waiting for me to board. This was leaving Milwaukee for Houston. Coming home leave Florida great. Get to Chicago no crew finally board plane wrong crew and asked us to get off the plane. Wait for right crew to get there held up in Milwaukee. Get on plane 1.5 hours late taxi back to terminal plane over heating. Get this fixed so we have no air conditioning in plane sweat and over heat to go to Milwaukee. What is the problem. Don't think I ever want to fly United again if this is the normal procedure.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-23;"Seattle-San Francisco/San Francisco-Sydney-Perth. The departure staff were some of the rudest uncooperative staff we have had to deal with. Having stood in ""row 5"" to board and submitting our boarding passes we were told our hand luggage had to be put in the hold as the overhead lockers were full. This was very unsatisfactory as we were ticketed through to Perth. There was no checking of legal size of cabin bags. We saw many oversize bags go aboard including a musical instrument case at least 4 foot long. People putting their second piece in overheads instead of at their feet. If this was policed there would have been room for all legal sized bags. As we are aged 75 and 77 we had medicine required to be taken on the 27 hour journey. After removing medicine we allowed bags to be placed in hold. As the plane was about to leave gate we realized our passports were in our hand luggage. On approaching the head stewardess and the captain and explaining we would be unable to leave USA until passports were returned. Only through the captains orders our hand luggage was unloaded and brought up to the cabin. Full marks to the captain he placed one bag in the cockpit and the head stewardess rearranged some other bags for the second one. This delayed departure by 15 minutes due to the incompetent staff at boarding gate not listening to where we were going. San Francisco to Sydney was poor service poor food no drinks unless you purchased them. Qantas flight Sydney to Perth only a 4 hour flight and free drinks with meal and the offer of second one .";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-21;"Rome to Newark (EWR) in Business First departing at 9:50 a.m. We were lucky that we could use the miles we had accrued with the United Mileage Plus card for this trip and were very happy with the flight. United uses Alitalia lounge for BusinessFirst customers which is located in the basement of the terminal. It's very dated with white leather chairs and orange plexiglass dividers between seating sections. There is a bar just beyond the entrance which looked very poorly stocked with almost empty bottles of various liquor and the surly server behind the counter begrudging made espressos on order. Food consisted of some bread butter jam small croissants and cold cereal. Overall a real disappointing experience. The flight was announced in the lounge and we proceeded to board. We were in seats 3K and 3L. Others have commented that the person in the window seat has to climb over the person in the aisle seat which is true. Once seated we were offered a choice of OJ Champagne Mimosa or water and handed our menus. Our flight attendants introduced themselves as did the flight customer service manager (not really sure what that means). After takeoff we were offered a beverage and warm nuts. Food service began and was very well done - in courses. Four options for entrees were given and wine was offered throughout the meal service. After lunch a cheese cart was offered followed by made-to-order sundaes. All in all very good. The new seats are fairly comfortable although at 6'1"" I found myself having to bend my legs a bit when lying down. Working the leg/foot and head rests took some getting used to. My biggest criticism would be that the ""storage"" shelf is over your shoulder and behind you. This includes the jack for the headset which I kept pulling out when I turned in the seat. It was hard to get to and pretty unusable. The entertainment selection was excellent with great late run movies television shows and music. An hour before landing we were offered a snack consisting of a chicken empanda fruit salad cucumber salad and chocolate. We landed 1/2 hour early and were the first off the plane. All in all a great flight.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-21;Flew a 747-400 from Chicago to Hong Kong. The economy seats were horrible. They were extremely small. The seats were so bad I stood for over 5 hours during the flight.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-21;Flew YEG to Amsterdam through Houston return in business first. Flight crew on all flights were great very professional and hard working. The one complaint was the food Tasteless overcook and very little variety. Also cabin could be kept a little tidier. Other than that good flights.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-20;"IAH-SFO on A319 and SFO-IAH on B787. Comparing the 2 legs with 2 different aircraft is hard. I would look forward to more planes look like the Dreamliner in regards to age and cleanness. I have no complaints but just general concerns. Economy Plus is just the more legroom nothing more nothing less. It's the small things that can add up a pillow here and tiny bag of peanuts there and lets say a complementary cocktail on longer flights in Eco Plus to stand up to the ""Premium Eco Class"" and to be ""Eco Plus friendly. I miss the work hard-fly right slogan.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-19;Boeing 777 SYD-LAX LAX-SFO SFO-SYD. Service was professional Food surprisingly good. IFE very good. Boeing 777 legroom is good. I'm not crazy on these new economy seats on United when the seat recline the seat base moves forward. This is not good for the back and make sleeping less comfortable. Altogether very good experience plus receiving 100% miles even though the ticket was discounted.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-18;Completely unreasonable and unwilling to help customers. Do not take United if you want any kind of decent customer service friendliness of staff or bearable trip. The woman behind the counter at check in seemed to feel a need to give me attitude for no apparent reason. Even at a small airport like in Ithaca NY United was unable to accommodate me.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-17;Had to fly United as it was the only one flying in at out at the times I needed. Flight from DEN-YXE was delayed twice on the way out. Then flying from YXE-DEN we sat in a small hot plane sweating for over an 1.5 hours after landing because Customs wasn't open for business yet and we weren't allowed off the plane. It is a daily flight so they should know when customs opens? Transfer from DEN-EUG had no gate until 2 hours prior which changed 2 times missed the flight because the last change was 20 minutes prior. Next flight out was 10 hours later. Unless you are person that likes sitting in Airports for days and enjoys wasting time and money this airline is an extreme last resort!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-17;Would never fly with United Airlines again we boarded the plane back from Florida to Newark to fly on to the UK to be greeted by miserable crew. This continued the whole of the flight. Anything asked of them seemed too much trouble food was awful and was practically thrown at us. Seating was so uncomfortable cramped together but the worst part was as we were coming into land at Newark the pilot overshot the runway had to pull back up very fast and circle to try again it all happened so fast - it was so scary but not one of the crew checked on any of us passengers one lady got up to be sick in the toilet - all we had was a female cabin crew shouting for her to get out of the toilet and sit down. A child around 9 yrs of age was beside himself but still no one came to check on us. We got down safely the second time after being told they were moving to another runway. But even after the plane got down safely not one of the crew came to see if anyone needed any help. The passengers are supposed to come first but in this instance none of us were. Wouldnt recommend this airline to anyone and will never fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-17;MKE-ORD-SFO and back. The first flight was delayed so we missed connection. Our connection was supposed to be a nice 777 but we missed it. Thankfully they said our flight was delayed because of maintenance problems so they gave a hotel and food vouchers. Slept at a nice hotel at ORD. Because of the low price for they tried to put us on a non direct fight for Washington and then to SFO. We finally got scheduled for a flight at 8:30. the airplane was okay. It was an old 757-200 with no entertainment systems or stuff. When we arrived at SFO it was midday and we still had time to explore the city.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-16;This was the worst travel experience I have had. I travel frequently for work and for leisure but this time I am unable to do either. I was scheduled to take off from LAX connect in ORD and then push on to ROC. Halfway through my first flight we were dropped down in Denver due to a closing at the ORD airport. They de-boarded re-boarded de-boarded re-boarded then de-boarded again. We were there for an excess of 4 hours standing in excessive lines awaiting information about connecting flights and possible re-bookings. It seemed like all the United agents were hiding! I was finally cleared to take off for Chicago and put on standby for 2 later flights to ROC. We were stalled on the runway at ORD and arrived at the gate very late. When I went to find my next flight it had been moved. No notification was sent to me but the agent ensured that it was boarding at another gate. I arrived at the new gate stood in line for 15 minutes to find out that all those flights were canceled. When I expressed my concern about missing work the next day I was barrated by the agent as he walked away from the desk and left me standing there without an answer. Thankfully I was automatically re booked for the next day but not given any accommodation. I stood in a customer service line for 2.5 hours to discuss accommodations with an agent. When I finally got to the front of the line I was told it was due to weather and I would not be accommodated. I told the agent that it wasn't weather that it was an excessively delayed flight that caused me to miss my connecting flights. He then handed me a bag of toiletries and suggested I find a hotel on my own and ushered me aside. By the time I walked away from the line it was 12:00 am and every hotel I called was booked. I am now sitting awaiting my flight to ROC and it too has been moved from gate to gate without proper notification. I was told to watch the monitors until my flight takes off. I also just found out that my flight will be delayed again. I now understand why United is suffering. their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. I don't recommend ever flying with this company. Rates are reasonable but it is most certainly not worth the hassle.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-16;United airline is a terrible airline for overseas travels. I flew Chicago to Frankfort. Crew were rude and unhelpful. Somebody was seating in my seat and crew didn't support me when I asked her to go back to her seat. I reserved a seat at the time of booking and they sold me the same seat for extra $100! In a 12 hr flight there is no free alcoholic beverage no socks toothbrush or toothpaste. I strongly recommend never fly with united especially for overseas.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-16;San Diego to Moline via Chicago O'Hare. When we landed in Chicago I received a text message from United Airlines that our connecting flight was canceled. They rescheduled us for 14 hours later! We live 2 1/2 hours away so we rented a car and drove. Our reimbursement was 1/4 the cost didn't even cover the car rental. No other mode of transportation was offered neither was a compensation for food or hotel if we had chose to stay and wait the 14 hours. This apparently happens very often. No excuse but they don't have a problem stealing your money and not giving anything in return. This company should not be allowed to run their business this way. I will never book a flight with United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-05-16;Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-13;IAD-SFO and SFO-IAD Flew United non-stop in economy. Absolutely no complaints. The planes were clean on time and the flight attendants were very good - always working. We brought our own food on board so cannot comment on the food sold. On the SFO-IAD flight there was quite a bit of turbulence but the pilot handled it very well. All of the United employees we encountered in the air and on the ground were friendly helpful and seemed to be happy in their jobs.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-12;I wish I would have read the reviews for United before letting the travel agency book me on one of their flights. Twice we took off from Denver and both times we were re-routed back. The only information we got was a two second message from the pilot that we were going back. We were completely on our own to find out what we were supposed to do. None of the United employees were at all helpful and are very disengaged at this airport and it seems like you are bothering them if you ask a question. After standing in the customer service line to re-book I was told no flights for two days. The customer service lady did seem to care and spent half an hour looking for alternatives. I heard all sorts of people complaining about this airline and our shuttle driver said she hears about them all the time.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-12;Recently flew several long international flights with United from Chicago to Tokyo and back. For a 12 hour flight there was no inflight entertainment no seatback TV and they not charge money for drinks. I would argue that United is well below the average. The flight attendants do the bare minimum and nothing more. I will not fly on United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-12;EWR-ZRH. Traveled with baby staff very inattentive and almost ignored our requests even as simple as asking for some water (to make baby food). When water was brought this was done with no empathy and not asking if there was something else they could do. Any question was first met by unfriendly looks. United's ground service at EWR was a catastrophe. There are electronic check-in counters about 20 with max. 3 staff to put the luggage onto the conveyor belt or to help if something can't be done through the user's interface the computer tells you to 'wait for staff to help you' we waited for more than 20 minutes.;NEGATIVE

Yes the seats in coach are tight and uncomfortable. But at least 2 of the 4 flights left on time. Both flights to PV were on time and landed a bit ahead of schedule. We weren't so lucky on our return flights. The flight out of PV was delayed about a half hour because our plane arrived late. The flight out of Houston was delayed about 90 minutes but wasn't United's fault. There were many storms in Texas that night especially in Austin where our plane was coming from. So again the delay was not the fault of United. When we finally did leave we hit a lot of turbulence but that was expected due to the weather. All in all United did OK. Other then a few of their complimentary drinks that's all we had on the plane. We refuse to pay for airline food. Not once on any flight did either my wife or myself use the bathroom. So to some it up even though I hate to fly this experience wasn't that bad.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-12;It seems to have become the norm for United Express to not announce any delays until everyone is checked in. Then the announcements come every half hour increasing the wait time. Our flight from Halifax to Newark was to depart at 1.10 pm and eventually left after 5pm. Our return flight was to leave at 8.38 pm and left after midnight. Never ever again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-11;Flew to Chicago on Friday flight was delayed 6 hours. When it came time to return home I received an email that my flight was cancelled. I talked to a United rep she told me an identical flight was leaving at the same time as my cancelled flight so she would book me on that one. Turns out she misinformed me there was no such flight. I got to the airport found out she had booked me for a flight the following day so I had to rebook yet again. On my return flight the plane was delayed 2 hours. We all get on the plane and after taxi-ing for 45 minutes we received an announcement that we were going back to the gate. I had to spend the night in the airport. I will never fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-11;My husband booked our flight out of Gulfport MS to Las Vegas. The price was good but we were not allowed enough time between connecting flights. My husband is in a wheelchair and I appreciate the skycaps who managed to get us to the connecting flights although it almost killed me at 65 to have to get through the airport with our luggage. The biggest mishap was that when we arrived in Los Angeles from Las Vegas we were told there was no room for our carry on luggage so it was checked. My husband's bag went to Hawaii. After many days of talking to people on the phone who obviously have a problem understanding English we finally got his bag delivered. Flying United was very stressful for me and I would be very hesitant to fly United again. I think they need to do a better job of informing their customers of what to expect.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-11;"Plane was supposed to take off at 1pm delayed to 3pm then finally to 7pm with no guarantee of no further delay. Now I am stuck in LAX waiting. All I got for the trouble caused by United Airline is a sorry from the representative and a $7 meal voucher - very good customer care indeed. Request to adjust seat told the plane is 100% full. Okay so I request to adjust seat in advance for my return flight now this is where it gets interesting: I was told by the desk representative that their ""system"" will not let her do so and was advised to use United Airline website to adjust seat myself the only problem is their website does not have the seat change option either. Overall I would not recommend anyone to take United Airline for their poor system setup and bad customer care.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-11;My husband and I recently returned from a trip using United Airlines. We arrived at our international destination 12 hours later than the original arrival time. Since that was mainly due to weather I can't blame United. On the way home though we had a terrible experience. Our final flight from Houston to Fayetteville was supposed to board at 6.45pm but they kept delaying it around every half hour until finally at midnight they canceled the flight entirely. There were no more flights going out that night and the next day's flights to our destination were completely booked. We were given vouchers for a hotel which we got to at 2.30am and vouchers for food for the next day at the airport. We had to book a flight to Tulsa where our family had to drive a long way to pick us up. This plane was also delayed for an hour for no apparent reason. Upon reaching Tulsa we discovered our luggage had been separated and my bag was sent to our original destination while my husband's stayed back in Houston airport. We had to drive to Fayetteville airport to pick up my bag. The next day we had to drive back to Fayetteville to pick up my husband's bag. Definitely the last time we will ever fly with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-10;EWR-IND think United is canceling more flights than they are operating. If not canceled flights are most of the time significantly delayed. Ground staff are unfriendly and not willing to help. This is not an experience just on this flight it seems to be always like that. Comfort and service in the aircraft is lousy. Will try not to go with United in the future.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-10;Traveled CLE-SFO-NRT-MNL March 15th returned May 7th. Business class. Booked this reluctantly experience a year earlier was not so great on the SFO-NRT leg. In cabin service and food was terrible. This year was a world different. All flights on time or early food was good inflight service was very good the inflight entertainment worked great check in was very friendly and attentive. The final leg is serviced by ANA. Last year the difference between UA and ANA was dramatic. This year practically seamless. The only change this year was that we were on the upper deck this time. We were amazed at the transformation in a year's time. Younger attentive flight attendants friendly service and all worked as planned. Great transformation!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-08;Do not pay the extra cost for the comfort seats. That is the biggest scam that this airline has going. I have paid for comfort seats on KLM and WestJet and they were so worth it. This airline - expensive and the only thing you get is slightly more leg room. The same uncomfortable seat in all other ways. This airline has to have the worst service of all airlines in the G20 (sorry have not flown others). Terrible seats extra cost for luggage what food is available is awful and expensive and now you have to pay for inflight entertainment. On a recent flight to Hawaii at least they had the courtesy of telling us not to bother because the inflight entertainment did not work over the ocean anyway. I love to read but 6 hours straight is quite a reading marathon. I will pay extra costs for a flight rather than fly United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-08;As a seasoned traveler I am constantly reminded what a disgrace United Airlines is to the Star Alliance. I've just completed a Star Alliance Round The World Business First trip on Thai Lufthansa Air Canada Air New Zealand and unfortunately one sector on United. Despite being Gold Elite status and paying $US15000 each for the fare United refused me entry to their lounge in MCO at 0615h - when it was almost totally empty. They seated my wife and I in 3B and 5F for the six hour flight to SFO despite being booked on the one ticket and pre- allocated 1A and 1B four months earlier! Are the traveling American public so accepting of sub-standard?;NEGATIVE

Superb Lufthansa service than you land in the USA and there is a long line at Passport control and no way to have an express service. I missed my connecting flight and what a surprise it was my fault and I had to pay for the hotel transport food etc.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-06;Nothing but delays right from the start. We flew Vancouver to Chicago then to Ireland. Everyone had to check in themselves and weren't given seat numbers until boarding so no sitting next to your family. Staff weren't friendly. Flight was an hour late departing. No organization at all at the airport. Would not use them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-05;My father and I had a reservation to fly from Boston to Sacramento. We had a connecting flight in Denver. Our flight leaving Boston was delayed 50 minutes our flight arrived in Denver at the exact time our connecting flight from Denver was leaving. United Airlines didn't hold the next plane just a few minutes and so 13 people on our plane missed the connecting flight. The next flight for Sacramento left the next morning so we went to customer service to have them reserve a hotel for us but they claimed that the error was not made by their airline and wouldn't pay for our hotel. Now we have to sit in an airport terminal all night. United Airlines is not a good airline and I won't be flying with them anymore.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-04;Nightmare with United last week. I had a 1st class ticket Miami-Chicago on UA and Chicago-Zurich-Brussels on Swiss 3 flights on one ticket. Connecting time in Chicago 3 hours and 25 minutes. Checked-in in Miami for my UA flight and Y flight was delayed several times. Finally the plane landed. Ready for boarding and then technical failure was announced. Staff did not know if and when the plane would leave. I explained my situation and asked to be rebooked on another airline any airline in order to leave Miami since I was supposed to have a knee surgery upon my return in Brussels. UA staff refused and were not polite at all. Finally at 8pm announcement that our flight was cancelled. I had spent nearly 7 hours at that airport. I was granted a room at the Holiday Inn airport which was fine and then food vouchers at the same hotel. In total 21 USD for lunch/dinner/breakfast. One thing is for sure never again United. I was rebooked on the day after Miami/Newark/Brussels on the day after first class domestic business class long-haul. Ok but far from the Swiss service standards.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-04;Outward journey on 30/3/2014 on flight UA 941 and inbound journey on 25/4/2014 on flight UA 17. We had a double cancellation of flights to and from LHR-EWR. Flight to LHR was cancelled but the reason remained unclear and the flight from EWR was cancelled after we were told there was a technical problem with the aircraft. Luckily they gave us hotel accommodation and taxi fares along with also breakfast and dinner vouchers. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. It caused lots of stress.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-03;FRA-SFO on 747-400 this might have been a 9 or 10 star review except for the very late (over 30 minutes) delivery of bags at SFO with priority bags not apparently given any priority - service onboard was impeccable - staff were attentive and professional and did everything they could to make the long flight as comfortable as possible - UA really does need to start handing out pyjamas in F and could also make the bed softer as well as making the blankets thicker and wider if they really want passengers to get some good sleep. Food was OK nothing special - the mushroom soup in a very small cup was the best course while the beef was tough.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-03;I really don't know how to express my dissatisfaction with United. I buy business class and get dumped into economy. No explanation nothing. Trite meaningless apologies are given. That's it. On my return trip the flight attendants were not very attentive in business. Once beverages were served at the beginning of the flight they disappear for the rest of the flight. The dinner meal for a 5.5 hour flight in business is a joke. A small plate of antipasto? That's an appetizer. The customer care program definitely needs improvement. Non responsive and when they do respond they ignore my complaint but do dwell on how great United is and they sincerely hope my next flight will be a good experience. United advertising is good unfortunately they only talk the talk. United has yet to learn how to walk the talk. United just frustrates me to no end.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-01;Horrible service rude flight attendants check in process rude. The woman told us it was not her job to do the check-in for us when we had questions and the machine would not print or accept my credit card. We were left to our own devices and were just rudely told to hurry up as we were not the only customers there. Since we booked with Lufthansa and paid regular prices and not with a cheap aircraft carrier this behaviour was outrageous! After we finally got our prints (just flight confirmations not boarding cards) we were told we would get the boarding passes at the gate. After asking a couple of times we got our boarding passes just to be told during boarding our daughter could not be seated with us because we were sitting in an emergency exit and she had to sit 7 rows behind us. The cabin attendants were not very helpful and finally we got a nice couple to swap places with us.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-01;April 27 2014 OKC to YYZ my connecting flight was in EWR. When I arrived at Newark I learned that my connecting flight was cancelled. The reason for cancellation - bad weather in Toronto. I asked the staff member to find me a different flight the best he could come up with was a flight for the next day! I explained that this was unacceptable. I then asked if I did accept the flight for the next day would I be given a hotel room for the night his response was no because if the flight is cancelled due to weather then the airline is not at fault and does not have to provide a room. To put the cherry on top he would not look for other flights except for the one for the next day. His suggestion was that I researched possible routes home and come speak to him later when I found another flight that was more acceptable to me. I was at a loss. I managed to acquire a flight home that same afternoon to Toronto on Air Canada. What I want to know is how is the weather in Toronto can be a problem for United airlines but not a problem for every other airline in North America. I fly several times a year I will never fly with United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-01;"I flew from BTV-EWR-DFW a few months ago and it was by far the worst experience. Outbound flight to EWR was delayed 1 hour 15 minutes. The connection in EWR was missed by about 3 minutes. The customer service agent was useless and also put the blame on myself for missing the connection. I waited about 5.5 hours in what has to have been the dingiest terminal in the US (Newark's C2 concourse) for the next flight to DFW which of course was delayed. Once boarded we sat at the gate for an additional 40 minutes without any communication from the crew. The pilot then informed us that ""it appears the people refuelling this thing put more in the right wing than they did in the left"". We waited yet another 20 minutes for him to come back and say ""to add insult to injury it appears that the APU is broken and it wouldn't be a good idea to fly without it."" An hour has passed since we boarded and we finally pushed back. The inflight service was sub-par and only one beverage service was offered during the 3.5 hour flight. Overall an appalling experience on an airline that used to be enjoyable. Also if you're not flying international or a hub to hub expect a regional jet or prop plane.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-01;We flew out to San Francisco on Delta on April 27 2014 - a great flight even though we had a longer trip because of storms. The flight waited on us constantly during the long flight. On May 1 2014 we flew home on United 1278. The two stewards and one stewardess were terrible! Went up and down twice during our flight back to Atlanta. I was in a window seat and hey never spoke to me! The pilot did a good job - but did not speak loud enough.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-05-01;MSY-EWR-LIS with an open-jaw return from LHR-EWR-MSY. I must confess I tempted fate here as I didn't want to leave New Orleans too early on a Sunday so I opted for the afternoon flight that would connect in Newark with the overnight flight to Lisbon. It was a short connection window (59 minutes) but I decided to risk it. Big mistake. Once we landed - wouldn't you know it - no available gate. So we waited an additional 40 minutes on the tarmac and then another 10 at the gate waiting for someone to operate the jetway to dock with the plane. I sprint off the plane and we were the last two people on the Lisbon flight. As it turns out that flight was delayed about 25 minutes. Our luggage wasn't so fortunate. When we initially inquired upon arrival in Lisbon they said it had been sent to Frankfurt and that it would be arriving on a TAP Air flight from Frankfurt at 3.25 that afternoon after which it would be delivered to us at our hotel. We left Lisbon the next morning and checked at the airport to see where our luggage was. No idea they said - the last reported location of the bags was Frankfurt. Off we flew to Paris - without luggage. Arriving at Paris-Orly (where there is no United presence) the only help we got was from a French ground services attendant who was nice enough and took our information as to where we were staying (in Normandy) but could offer little else. We spent the next 3 nights in Normandy with no luggage and no one attempted to contact us about it. Four days later finally someone from United got a hold of us and told us our luggage had arrived at London Heathrow. Since that was our final night of the trip we just opted to pick it up at the airport the next morning upon check-in and change at the airport lest we go through the hassle of yet another botched bag delivery. Only when we arrived at LHR we were told that our bags were already sent ahead to Newark on an earlier BA flight. So here we were - at the conclusion of an 8-day trip with no luggage. At least we'd be able to collect our bags once we arrived back home in New Orleans. Our bags never made it from Newark that evening. They'd come the next day they said. Finally at 2 in the afternoon almost nine days after I'd checked in the bag I was reunited with it. In one generation United has gone from industry standard to mediocre to absolute lowest common denominator.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-30;Do not take United flight from Honolulu to Guam. The plane and configuration used is for domestic flights plus there is no inflight entertainment. I fly business first all the time with United. This flight was nearly 8 hours and it was like flying with a 3rd world airline. Food was terrible. An unbelievable experience for an airline that generally does very well.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-30;Business class AMS-ORD-YVR. Check in went very smooth departure with 15 minutes delay due to air traffic control. I was seated in a window seat which was ok but if you want to get out of it you have to bother your neighbor. Flight attendants were quite old no youngsters like on flights with KLM. Food selection and service were good. Also the inflight entertainment was sufficient. With a small delay we landed at ORD. The flight to YVR was not special in business. Snack was below average and seat is medium. Overall satisfying and would do it again for the price.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-29;Flew TLV-EWR-SFO and back flights were on time boarding was smooth crew were pleasant and friendly. Food standard airplane but served hot. Experience from flying with other airlines we came equipped with movies books on our tablets.;POSITIVE

Left Fort Lauderdale late ran to connecting flight with less than 15 mins to spare flight ended up 4 hours delayed but was never updated online or any departure board. Connecting flight Eventually cancelled because of fog in Newfoundland all though other family members arrived home on Air Canada and Westjet without the fog being an issue. They did give us a toiletry bag to take back to hotel we paid for. No apology but was put on a 6 am flight following morning. Terrible service and flights with no entertainment or compensation.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-28;My wife our 10 month old and myself flew from Columbus Ohio to Richmond VA with a stop in Cleveland. Our plane was late getting into Columbus which made us late for our connection in Cleveland. The next available flight wasn't until 8pm that evening giving us a 9 hour layover in Cleveland and causing us to miss the wedding rehearsal dinner we had planned on attending that evening. However when we reached our destination nearly 10hrs from our original arrival time we found that our luggage was lost. We received the same explanation from customer service while our bags flew from Cleveland to Charlotte to who knows where. On our last evening in Richmond a few short hrs from our next departure time and at 2am in the morning the doorbell rang and our luggage appeared for which I then had to pay another $25 to get it back on the plane for our return trip to Columbus. Just when things couldn't get any worse the ticket attendant at Richmond airport told me that my wife and infant's son were on the same ticket and my wife wouldn't need her own to get through security. We stopped and grabbed some coffee said goodbye to our in laws and stood in line to get through security. Once we reached the front of the line the TSA agent told my wife she needed to return to the ticket counter in order to get her own boarding pass. Unbelievable. So we returned to the ticket counter where the attendant who originally issued us our boarding passes proceeded to tell me it was my fault and my wife's name was not showing up on the reservation. Then mysteriously she found her name and printed the correct boarding pass. Once we got through security and to the gate the gate attendant made a snide comment about being the last one's on the plane and charged us another $25 to gate check our carry on bag-the same bag we carried on for free 3 days earlier. I realize United might have slightly cheaper airline tickets but please do yourself a favor and spend an extra few bucks to fly in peace with all of your luggage. In the end our lost bags cost us an extra 200-300 hundred dollars anyway and the service we received in Richmond was absolutely terrible.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-28;"LHR-EWR: sat on tarmac at LHR for 3 hours before being informed the flight was cancelled due to a maintenance issue. United tried to re-book us on a flight 24 hours later and only after considerable effort did they find us seats on a (half empty) BA departure. EWR-HR: Flight was overbooked so without asking us we were ""upgraded"" to Ec. Plus. The net result of which was I lost my aisle seat for a middle. I would have preferred to stay in Ec but was not consulted before being moved. The check-in staff at both LHR and EWR are easily the rudest I have ever come across. Also United don't have on-demand entertainment (someone please tell them its 2014 not 2004) and the seats are uncomfortable and narrow. Unless there is a massive price premium please take my advice and fly with a different airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-27;I recently booked a flight to Denver from Kansas City trip cost was $376 avoiding other airports I wanted a one way flight to and fro. Price went to $925. Then while boarding the flight we have a prop plane. The seats were so narrow and of course no air-conditioning. The flight took an exceptionally long time back and forth from Kansas to Denver. I don't understand the United Airline Magazine says how their improving the flight for the customer. I think its time the execs take a flight cause your badly mistaken.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-27;March flights. We were a party of 6 and it was the first time flying United. We flew from Toronto connecting in Chicago and ending up in New Orleans. First they were an hour late taking off. The pilot said they were contracting out the baggage handling so they were slowly putting one bag at a time on the conveyor. As a result we missed the connection in Chicago. Then 3 (or 4 - I lost count) gate changes and delays. The we boarded then de-boarded. They didn't want to assign seats for 3 of our party even though I had bought and paid for the flights 11 months before they over-book and weren't sure 3 of us would make the flight. Finally arrived in New Orleans 6 hours later than scheduled. Of course we weren't seated together. Return flight - one of our party didn't get a seat at all. Had to take a later flight and all that entails.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-27;Just returned from USA. SYD-SFO-LV-NY-SFO-SYD. Overall very good experience - travelling with 3 others inc 2 Children. Upgraded both international legs to economy Plus - makes a world of difference. Staff on Board were very welcoming (not OTT but very professional). Only gripe was that after a late Arrival NY-SFO it was announced that for those connecting to Sydney Australia that plane was being held (there were about 10 of us) and that we needed to proceed to International Gate 102. We all arrived there as quick as possible only to be told the plane was not going to wait and never was. The delay ex NY was not a UA issue - ground staff at Newark. Anyway - proceeded back to Customer Service desk where a fantastic attendant was very helpful provided us with a comp at the Crown Plaza near Airport and gave us some comfort packs. With 777 aircraft replacing 747 ex Sydney United will get my business again (at the right price).;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-25;"After a 20 min delay during the first part of our trip we arrived in Charlotte only to be told we had to race across the entirety of the airport in less that 15 mins (which would have been feasible if we had the full 35+ mins). We managed to reach the gate 6 mins prior to the 'last' boarding call but they had ""closed the doors for an early departure"" and refused to allow my wife and I onto the plane. They then directed us to go all the way back across the Airport to get lower quality and separate seats on a much later flight. They attempted no form of compensation or even an apology and acted as if it were our fault and that they were doing us a favor by 'allowing' us to get the terrible seats. The worst of it though is their claim to be both Military and Handicap friendly but they fail in both.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-24;Plane looked extremely old and worn. Food was poor even by airline standards. Inflight entertainment consistent of overhead screens with 80's image quality. Can't remember when I last sat in a plane with such prehistoric inflight entertainment. The worst were the stewardesses. Not all of them. But some of them were really unfriendly. The highest level of service that one older grumpy stewardess could muster during a 10 hour flight was to tell me that I had been standing at the back of the plane for too long (I was reading a book standing up couldn't bear sitting in the seat anymore) and I needed to sit down. Probably the least service-centred flight I ever experienced. United Airlines is an airline that I will use in the future only when I can't afford the alternatives.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-23;Flew from Okinawa Japan with final destination at D.C. Dulles (IAD) with stops at Narita (NRT)-Tokyo and Chicago O'Hare-ORD. Flight from Okinawa to Tokyo is always through ANA since United contracts them out to and from Tokyo to Okinawa. I then flew a 747 Economy Plus from NRT to ORD. Waste of money to upgrade to Economy Plus. A little more leg room and width but that is it. Food and drink service was the same (not much) so can't recommend this. No personal entertainment (was all on the big screen). Food was not good and seems to be deteriorating no longer do they give you any fruit or vegetables but just one course meal and that is it. I also noticed they now charge you for a beer or wine I think they just changed this as of January 2014? I paid an embarrassing $6 for a Heineken which I thought used to be included for Economy Plus? Service was just ok and nothing special. I then flew from ORD to IAD and again Economy Plus but waste of money. Seats felt tight and cramped and I noticed absolutely no under the seat room for bags or stretching out? Onboard departure was chaotic as people couldn't store their luggage in overhead bins.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-23;"Flight on April 22 2014 was delayed and then cancelled. After sitting and being told the takeoff was being delayed 3x they finally cancelled the flight.

united-airlines;2014-04-23;I've had an awful experience both times I've flown with United. The first time all my flights were over booked and delayed. (Two flights there and back due to connections.) They gave us very little information about why and were extremely pushy when finally getting us to board the plane. We spent a long time sitting in the plane after being boarded with no explanation before we finally took off. They offered compensation to take a later flight but I had already been delayed for 2+ hours! On the more recent flight the flight was overbooked and I was unable to get on. There were no other flights out of YYC to SEA and I ended up having to cancel my trip. They have not been helpful when I tried to contact them. They told me they were transferring me to International Customer Service but I was just disconnected! I would not recommend United. Avoid them if you can!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-22;I can honestly say this was the worst trip I have had in 20 years. Seat allocation is by far the worst especially if you are travelling with children. Chances of getting seats together are slim. My 11 year old wasn't even allocated a seat regardless how many times we tried online prior to flying and we booked last June. After a lot of stress got a seat but not together. They over book all flights and offer people compensation if they take another flight. Or offer you an upgrade to get all seats together as they tried with us for an extra££80 each. As someone said to us on the flight was that they are only after money. As regards to check in at Heathrow. What a mess. All electronic to get boarding passes. It was like a bun fight. United make a big thing about there new systems and app but have forgotten the most important thing. The customer. Luggage. Make sure each bag is under weight. As they don't take into account overall weight. Tried to charge us £150 for 1 bag over by 2 lbs. We transferred it to a lighter bag. As I said before only interested in the money. They could learn a thing or too from EasyJet as regards to seating. The food was good is the only positive experience. I would never use again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-22;I am sitting in First EWR-LHR so can't complain too much but I'm shocked at how a global first customer is treated. First I had to argue with the gate agent at the entrance to the global first/global services lobby who said I was not allowed in. I pointed out that I was flying global first 3 times and then demanded that we ask the people inside who said I was of course welcome. After heading into the lounge which at EWR is only a United club not first I went to the gate which was chaotic. They called global services group 1 and I came in behind the one GS person in group 1. I was actually pulled out of line and held back because they said only global services. I asked about global first and group 1 which was being called and was promptly told first class is very different from global services. I know now why I usually just take Lufthansa and connect through Germany for their grace and ease. It is amply clear that we million miler 1k fliers just aren't worth much at united. Why bother being loyal.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-22;My flight out of Austin to San Francisco was delayed over an hour which caused me to miss my next flight. That flight was the last one out of SF for the night. The 3 people at the counter in Austin told me bluntly that there would be no compensation for the fact that I was going to stay the night sleeping in the terminal in SF. When I arrived in SF I went to the counter in Terminal 1 looking to get my boarding pass for the next day. I was handed hotel and food vouchers. I use United because they're the only carrier out of my smallish town (Chico CA) and before getting that voucher I had promised myself never to use United and to drive the almost 2 hours to Sacramento to use another carrier.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-21;My first trip to Asia IAD-SFO-ICN (Seoul Incheon) and back. A319 from IAD to SFO was small first class seats were old and not great. FA's were good food was OK Flew global first on a 747 to Seoul. Toilets stopped working half way through the flight and we landed in Osaka for repairs. Delayed my trip by two hours but the crew handled it well. Return flights was upstairs in business first seat was narrow but not bad IFE was good food was also good. SFO to IAD on a 757-200 that had to be 25 years old with CRT IFE from 1990. FA's were excellent but the plane needs to be retired. Overall a good trip and I truly think once United modernizes its fleet it needs to decide if it wants to compete with the foreign carriers. If so maybe a few less seats in business class get away from 2-4-2 configuration and perhaps better first class seating in the domestic fleet.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-21;I fly with United because it is one the few alternatives to fly directly to Bogota. They do not respect the seat assignments. On 2 occasions they changed without explanation even though I had paid for economy plus set they sent me to the back I had to really fight to get one in economy plus. On a 5 hour international flight they give you nothing just a drink. No entertainment.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-19;"I flew First Class on UA14 HNL-EWR. The plane was clean and the entertainment system was excellent. The food however was inedible. What they called ""chicken cacciatore"" was really a piece of cardboard. I have had better food in Coach on other airlines. Service on the flight was de minimus. The flight crew seemed only interested in finishing the pitiful dinner service as quickly as possible. Nobody flies for the food but United sets the bar for the worst food and catering in the industry. I thought Delta had poor food (which they do) but by comparison they look pretty good.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-16;Most excruciating flight I have endured was the 757 UA flight from Newark to Oslo on 5 April. The seats in economy were sadistically cramped. The aisle was so narrow that the crew could not move their carts without repeatedly banging and bumping into passenger seats. United's utter contempt for its customers and its crews is all too evident in its creation of such a tortuous experience. United has finally jumped the shark in the cheap cheesy penny-pinching department. I can choose to fly another airline and believe me I will.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-16;As a long time Continental customer and I really am trying to like United but they sure make it difficult. This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-16;LAX-NRT-LAX (en-route to BKK) BizFirst on UA's new 787. Service both directions was really top notch. The crew were professional and attentive and on both legs the International Service Co-ordinator came to personally thank each passenger for their business and for choosing United (I thought that added a very nice touch). Meals were actually quite good and the wine parings worked well. Opted for the Japanese meal on the return and found it pleasantly delicious (including the array of sushi appetizers). The best thing about the trip was the aircraft. Arrived refreshed and didn't feel like I'd spent 12 hours in an airplane upon landing. Would recommend flying the a/c wherever possible. Overall high marks for this flight.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-16;Orange County-SFO Round Trip - April 2014. Be aware: paying extra for an Economy Plus gives you the privilege to board last (group 5). On a full plane it means that the overhead bins will be full when you embark and you will be deny boarding with your carry-ons. They will be checked at the gate of the aircraft. It happened to us on both legs of this trip even though our carry-ons were undersized and we had only one per person other than my wife's purse and my computer shoulder bag. But for our surcharge we had a free half glass of water served by stern attendants. What a bargain! Too bad Virgin America no longer flies out of SNA. I really miss them. Their service is light years ahead of United. And when you pay a premium for a Virgin seat you have real perks coming with it. Not bait and deceit.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-15;"This was our worst experience. United Airlines had already been the airline with the most customer complaints and proved to be true when we took a trip to Florida. On the way back our flight for 3pm had been delayed for 5pm and then was cancelled due to ""maintenance issues."" We took another flight for 8pm and again was delayed to 9.30pm. We asked the lady at the counter and she said that the cabin crew wasn't prepared for travel so they delayed the flight. They are disorganized and I will never be flying United again.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-15;United Express: I flew from ORD to ASE in March and although they have us over a barrel as they are the only airline with non- stops the flight wasn't bad. We had to cram into a little regional jet definitely much smaller than United's traditional mainline aircraft but it was a relatively new plane. The seats did seem smaller but the service was jut about the same as its big brother. The fare was on the high side though.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-15;"I have flown from Newark to Delhi or Mumbai multiple times. The routing works well for me as I can access EWR from Philadelphia easily with the Amtrak codeshare although since they require more than a 3 hour layover in EWR on the way back the codeshare is only useful outbound. I like the Economy Plus seating which is a plus for the long trip. Despite being at the top Premier level however I find that I never get upgraded to business class despite supposedly having ""System-wide upgrades"" available. In practice these can never be used on these flights in my experience and one has to pay extra to be ""eligible"" then does not get the upgrade anyway. I am trying to book a ticket now and even though 38/40 business class seats are empty they will not confirm the upgrade and from what one reads on the internet the only way to get it is to check again and again and again and perhaps you might get lucky when they have opened one. In general the ""free upgrade"" offer for international travel seems to be a scam. The economy plus seating is better than normal economy though although I'm not sure it compares favorably with other airlines' economy.";NEGATIVE

Told to disembark get out luggage at Arrivals and go to Departure area to rebook. This on a 747 with 350 plus people on it - all pulling their luggage about 1/2 mile to Departure area. Line up at departure area United to re-book - wait 7 hours to get to counter. Only 2 staff members to rebook the entire airplane. I was put on Delta the next day to NRT. Gave me $10 voucher for meals and over night free stay in Waikiki hotel. Cheapest meal at hotel was $18. Next AM Delta took off on time got me to TKO then transfer to United back to BKK. Never again with United!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-14;I flew from DCA-EWR on Monday April 14. It was a mess United cancelled all of its flight out of DC without any reason. The weather was perfect my flight was suppose to be at 11.30am they cancelled it then I was put on the 4.30pm which was delayed and finally at 6.30pm they decided to cancel. They don't think of their passengers they don't respect their time this airline is really the worst airline I've ever flown. Would not recommend.;NEGATIVE

Chicago O’Hare-London Heathrow UK. UA0938 23rd June 2013. I cannot understand United are not upping their care for its customers. We flew with United on our last holiday and quite honestly never again. We have flown to many places around the world and United without any doubt are the worst airline I have used. The cabin crew are lazy and somewhat rude doing as little as they can. They could not even ask for the window blinds to be raised when coming in to land at London Heathrow. They did a standard talk when we were on the plane (with a special welcome to our premium and military customers). So quite obviously the economy passengers do not matter remembering of course that it is economy passengers that are the bulk of their customers.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-13;We flew from LAX to Dublin Ireland. I will never fly United again. The plane looked old it was also dirty. The drink service took forever! I realized it was because when you order a soda they don't give you a cup of ice and the can anymore. No. They now open a can a pour some into the cup for you and then use the same can for the next passenger. I've never had an airline do this. Very cheap. The worst part was the food. I am a vegetarian. When I booked the flight and went online to request a vegetarian option the only option I saw was Indian food. I highly dislike Indian food so I thought this was odd. I called customer service to inquire about other vegetarian options. They have no satisfactory options for vegetarians. I told her I would stick with the regular meal instead my plan was to eat the sides. When the meal service came around they brought me the Indian vegan plate! I told them that I did not request this and asked for a regular meal. They said they did not have enough and maybe once they served everyone if there was an extra I could have it. I didn't eat on the way to Ireland. On the way back I had to make sure to bring food for me to eat on the plane. Both flights to and from were delayed by 2+ hours.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-11;"I recently was on a United flight from DFW to ORD with my two small children (3 years and 10 months). After takeoff it became necessary for me to change my daughter's diaper. I pressed the flight attendant button and told the man that I needed to utilize the restroom with my daughter but since the lavatory was so small it was impossible to bring my 3 year old son with me. I asked if he could keep an eye on him just to ensure he stayed seated. I was told very tersely that this was not his job and he couldn't possibly do such a thing. I tried contacting United and got the following response ""The flight attendants are not required to assist with these type of activities it is strictly up to the flight attendants."" If you offer no assistance for people traveling alone with multiple children perhaps you should make your customers aware of your flight attendants utter uselessness before they board a plane assuming they will be treated as valued customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-11;"SFO-LAX and LAX-LHR - in the recent past this airline has made my no-fly list for being unreliable to the point of fitting the description of ""not fit for purpose"" so I was reluctant to use them on this routing but had no choice as it was part of a Star Alliance mileage redemption. In fact both flights were easy to check in with no surprises boarded in an orderly way pushed early the crew were friendly the meal on the 777 from LA to London was tasty the entertainment options on the 777 were diverse and well chosen (and no tedious pre-roll ads before the movies) and my bags were on the carousel promptly. Couldn't ask for more so they're off my no-fly list and fingers crossed for a few more flights like this. All we need now is to get rid of the ghastly 90s photoshop globe with the wonky perspective and bring back the Saul Bass tulip.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-10;First time when we used united airlines international connecting flight in San Francisco we notice their system are very disorganised in their terminal no one to help and most staff are not helpful. On another experience coming back from LAX going back to Sydney the staff at check were the same - all unhelpful. All they did was stand and talk among themselves.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-08;United Airlines was a disaster to travel through and not worth the amount of stress they cause all of their passengers. I was on a 7 hour flight and they had all movies and shows on repeat. The staff were very unhelpful. My flight ended up getting cancelled and I got re-routed to a much longer flight pattern. There were others I could have taken but United were SO unhelpful that I didn't find out until after the flight. The people there have no idea what they're doing. I was a day late for an important meeting. I received nothing in return for the inconvenience.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-04-06;We were on the last leg of our trip at Denver Airport when out flight had been delayed 5 times. After the fifth time they changed out gate assignment and again the flight was delayed twice. After waiting until almost all other flights from the airport were gone for the night our flight was canceled. We were sent to customer service where things were even worse. Told we would have to stay in Denver until late the next day or even until 2 days from then. I was able to find flights the next day on many other airlines but they would not allow. We then decided to driver home from Denver Co to Madison WI (15 hours) with two young kids. The customer service lady gave us some vouchers for the food stores in the airport but the stores would not accept these vouchers. I will pay great amounts of money and drive hours to other airports to never use this airline again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-06;United overbooked my flight. They asked me to take a later flight to Hawaii when I refused they changed my flight anyway which gave me a five hour wait at the SF airport. They offered nothing for this inconvenience and acted as if they were doing me a favor. This was my first and last trip on United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-02;I recently flew First Class on United # 15 from Newark to Honolulu. This is a 10+ hour non stop flight. The plane leaves at 9:20 am in the morning. The 767-400 was recently updated with the new sleeper seats. The plane was clean and very comfortable. The entertainment system was excellent. The crew were efficient and nice. The really surprising disappointment was the food. A breakfast was served shortly after take-off but after that there was nothing except some doughy concoction that was served an hour before landing. The paucity of food and food service was stunning. Most other airlines serve Mai Tais on flights to Hawaii but not on United. I might as well have been on a flight to Cleveland. My advice to people traveling on United is to bring your own food even in First Class!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-02;Very disappointed with my experience with United on Feb 2014. Had a first flight that was oversold we couldn't get on the plane. Had to be re-routed and got 3 flights instead of 2 originally scheduled to arrive at 9 pm instead of 4.30 pm to destination. We found out prior to our last flight that we had not been properly booked into the flight had to be changed to another flight again after an hour of waiting at the understaffed customer service desk. At destination now trying to confirm our seats for the return flight. It's been cancelled! We've tried to call customer service after a 20 minutes wait we're told that we need to be transferred to international flight dept. Another 20 minute wait. Another transfer. We ended up waiting 2hours. Very poor service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-01;Flew SFO to PEK on 29th March in First and we had an exceptional crew. I'm not normally one to post positive reviews about United but they deserve this one. We found all flight attendants to be friendly eager to assist and they tried their best to meet all requests. The food was tasty and served at the appropriate temperature. It's still not exactly an elegant service but it's good.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-01;"I was a loyal and frequent Continental flyer for a number of years. All airlines have problems and cause the passengers problems. Continental was not an exception. However I was generally pleased with the aircraft (the newest of fleets) and with service. I recall having been delayed at AUS on a trip to LHR via IAH with my wife. We arrived at IAH with only 3 minutes to spare. We were met with a cart and our passports were checked and tickets issued as we sped along. All that ended with the UAL merger. I got caught in FRA with the merger mess on ""the"" day and since then it has been a series of canceled and long delayed flights with missed connections and very old and ragged aircraft. Most recently I tried to fly AUS to LAX on a CRJ in First. The attendant grabbed my suit coat and started stuffing it in an overhead bin. I objected as I was to go straight into a meeting. Seems the closet had been removed for an additional rows of seats. We were delayed for de-icing then for a malfunctioning APU. Finally at the 2+ hour point we returned to the gate and I deplaned making an AA flight in time. I suspect this is my last UAL attempt. Too unreliable.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-04-01;Second time in 25 days connection return flight layover +3 hours plus delayed takeoff by 3 hours out of O'Hare. This time there wasn't even any weather issues. Also both trips had cancellations and overbooking. Why bother paying for poor service when I can actually drive home faster.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-31;London Heathrow to Newark to connect to Fort Lauderdale Florida. My trip to Newark was uneventful. It was after landing in Newark that everything went wrong. Starting with the long immigration lines that wound around and around. My connection was scheduled to depart at 1.17pm and I was still at immigration at 1.10 even after enquiring about help from a United representative who was standing talking to a fellow colleague. She told me to join the line and when I ask what happened if I missed my connection she just tersely answered they will rebook you and walked away. At baggage claim there was no sign of my bag I was told to catch the flight and look for my bag in Fort Lauderdale. I finally got seated without a welcome or assistance from the two attendants standing at the door. We sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours. In the meantime however the empty seats started filling up little by little and I began to wonder if they were not just awaiting a fill to capacity flight. Not offered anything to eat. They gave us tea coffee or water and that was it. Needless to say that when I go to Fort Lauderdale my checked baggage was not there and was told it had been left in Newark and would be arriving on the 11pm flight. As I am writing this my baggage has still not been delivered.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-31;Narita Tokyo to Singapore Changi on March 28th. IFE did not work (and even if it did I would be stuck with according to what was in in-flight mag an old and poor quality selection) food awful and had to pay for wine on a transcontinental flight (a first for me). Whole flight experience a bit of a revelation for me as I am used to flying Asian and European carriers. It was a bit like flying a short-hop domestic flight in UK - nothing much really to keep you happy while you are stuck in your seat. Maybe UA treat international flights like their domestic US ones. Even the announcements were the worst I have come across. Purser who did not seem to be able to speak English and a captain who had obviously not been sent on any course about speaking to the public (lacklustre disjointed and very rare). Won't be booking anything with UA again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-31;Feb 2 from Newark to Punta Cana flight UA 1520 returned Feb 9 flight UA 1518. Traveled from Newark on March 21 flight UA 423 to Fort Myers. Returned on March 24 flight 1587. What a disappointment! It started at check-in at Newark airport they expect you to do everything and if you ask for help they make it seem they are doing you a huge favor. The seats are super tight have to pay for luggage food TV I'm surprised they don't charge to let you use the bathrooms! They make you feel like you are getting on a bus.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-31;I just returned from a flight from Chicago (ORD) to Tampa (TPA) for spring break. I made a reservation that was non-stop both to Florida and returning home. I'm handicapped and was traveling with my 7 yr. old grandson. The flight to Florida was fine leaving and arriving on time. The flight home was a different story my flight home was cancelled during the night and I was booked on a flight that left 40 min. earlier with a layover in NJ. for 2 hr. then another plane which we had to sit on for 30 min and leaving late. I called and explained why I needed a non stop flight I was told the only non stop plane wasn't leaving until 3 days later. This meant instead of a less the 3 hr flight it was a 7.5 hrs. I was unable to get any help from management customer service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-31;I flew from Heathrow to Charleston (SC) via Washington Dulles for vacation in late March. I flew UA123 which was a B757-200. This was an old plane but it had great AVOD and leg space and the staff were friendly. The flight was also early and very empty which is always a plus. The connections were typical subsidiary small airline service. nothing special nothing bad and on time. On my return from Washington our B777-2000 was delayed due to a fuel problem however the entertainment system was left on so we could finish our film. After a 45min delay the plane left and made up the time coming back across the Atlantic. This plane was half-empty and had been recently refurbished with a great AVOD system and spacious seating. Cabin crew were very helpful. I would definitely recommend United on the Heathrow - Washington route.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-28;LAX-SFO-SEA-LAX in United First. Outbound legs to Seattle were great. Service was warm and personalized even if only snack basket and drinks were offered on these short runs. Where United really shined was on the return flight. Original SEA-LAX flight was canceled due to mechanical on inbound aircraft. I received a text message with this update and before I could even get to the agent UA had me rebooked on another carrier getting in just 30 minutes after my original UA routing. When I got up to the agent she had my ticket ready and waiting for me. I fly United almost every week and seldom have cancellations or major delays. Regardless the way they handled this one was flawless and I couldn't have asked for better service all-around.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-28;"4 Sectors with United YVR-ORD ORD-BOS BOS IAH IAH-YVR. Very poor customer service on the ground and in the air. Greeted at the aircraft door by the usual icy scowl. A ""good morning"" from me totally ignored on all sectors. Officious cabin crew. A request for two drinks met by a terse response of ""We do more than one drink service this is United!"" Hugely oversized carry on bags allowed in the cabin. As a result the last few passengers to board are separated from their carry-ons and ordered to relinquish them even if they are of legal size. Purchased a roast beef sandwich on the 4.5 hour BOS-IAH leg it was tiny soggy and disgusting. On the 5 hour IAH-YVR sector departing at 2100 no hot items for purchase just snack boxes with cheese and crackers. I don't believe that United is any different to any other US airline these days. I can tolerate the ancillary charges the cramped seating the lack of food I understand that's what most of the budget conscience travelers demand these days. But simple manners courtesy and mutual respect cost nothing to provide and sadly they seem to be the most difficult qualities to find in any US airline.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-28;If there is any alternative to flying United take it. The staff do their best but everything about the interface is far from traveler-friendly. First of all the food - and this is in first class - can only be somebody's idea of comedy. Murky chalky flavors and strange un-natural textures characterized every dish I was given. Also on one recent Newark - Los Angeles flight there was were no screens in the plane - no movies no TV. No wireless available and no plugs.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-27;The worst experience I have encountered when flying. Total disregard to their customers and employees. The poor people at the gate were just beat up to no end and it was not their fault. Flew out of Aspen Colorado which only has 6 gates and 2-3 planes to manage and they could not even accomplish this simple management. United changed my flight without even giving me the courtesy of an e-mail or phone call to check to see if this arrangement was ok. It wasn't even a change in a flight on the same day but they changed the day I was flying out changed from one layover to two layovers changed the total flight time and did not even offer an apology for this inconvenience. In the future the only way I will ever fly United again is if there was no other airline going to this location. A horrible experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-27;I am on a flight to LAX from SFO already delayed by 45 mins waiting for flight crew to arrive. This had already given me a pretty good idea of customer service the flight's staff has to offer but that got solidified when I asked for 2 cups of water from one flight attendant and she told me - 'why don't you finish one first?'. She eventually got me another cup.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-27;Denver to Midland scheduled departure time was supposed to be 2.15pm. The flight was delayed 3 times and all while the plane was sitting at the boarding gate. The airline employee spike very broken English. Said that anyone traveling with children needed to be checked due to weight restrictions. She then said that 6 people needed to give up their seats for luggage of other travelers or she would not let the last people that checked in on the flight. No one volunteered so she picked 6 people 2 of which were military personnel. Once on the plane people were told to move seats to even out weight since. We will never fly with this airline again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-26;First international flight from MCO to HKG was great. Very smooth. Crew very helpful. Being on a 15+ hr flight hydration is important. All I had to do was take my water bottle to the back and the crew happily refilled it for me multiple times. They even came around with trays of cups with water every so often. Second flight back (HKG to MCO) was a disaster. First flight from HKG to Newark was delayed 2 hours. Not a big deal we still had time to make our connecting flight. However the plane was further delayed by another 1.5 hrs after we were already on it. The crew were extremely rude. After 6 hours of no water my husband asked if we could refill my water bottle same as the first flight but this time they looked at him like he was crazy and said they were about to bring the drink cart around so to just wait for that. By the time we finally touched down in Newark we missed our connecting flight so had to be put on one 4 hours later. Again that flight from Newark to MCO was delayed. Instead of leaving at 9pm as scheduled we took off from the runway at 11pm after waiting 2 hours on the plane. One of the bathrooms was not functioning properly. They made an announcement that they weren't going to fix the bathroom but had to fill out paperwork anyway so we'd be off the ground as soon as paperwork was finished. Next thing we know a guy is coming down the aisle and starts fixing the bathroom. Then we had to wait for him to fix it before we took off. In the meantime they let 5 more people on the flight so they had to play the safety video a second time before we could take off. Thankfully we had no problem getting our luggage. The movie selection available was also decent. Food was okay for the first two meals and the third was disgusting.;NEGATIVE

I got re- booked on the flight for the next day at the same time was given a night at hotel and $14 voucher for the meal for the whole day. The next day I found out that my connection to Sao Paulo to Rio no longer existed so was booked on a later flight with a regional airline. Basically what should've taken me 14 hours took me 48 hours. Furthermore my luggage arrived 2 days afterwards after several phone calls and different answers from United agents. The food served on the plane was inedible. Worst air travel experience. The seat was so crammed for a 9+ hour flight I had to buy premium economy on my way back so that my knees won't hurt.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-24;Absolutely the worst flight. Both trips were delayed for aircraft mechanical issues. 3 hrs on the way there 4 hrs on the way back. I've never really liked United but we still fly because we were avid Continental flyers for years. I will make it a personal goal to avoid United as an airline for any future flights I have. The price was ridiculous and the service and crew were mediocre at best. I thought United had newer aircraft fleet. Then why are two flights delayed because of mechanical issues? I would never recommend flying United.;NEGATIVE

When I asked the cabin crew if I was obliged to have this person sitting ""on top"" of me she stated he was allowed to put his seat back. As a result I sat for 6 hours approx with no reasonable space in front of me. I got no food as there was no room to let down my food tray.";NEGATIVE

We've always been around 50 pounds for our checked bags sometimes a little over sometimes less and most airlines don't care as long as you're close enough. Not United - it's 50 lbs exactly or they won't take your bags. Their check in staff are normally pretty unhappy and rude. What makes it even more ridiculous is most people just shift the weight to their carry-ons - meaning the airplane is still carrying the exact same amount of weight.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA 468 SFO-PHX First Class. UA 1265 PHX-EWR First class. Typical domestic UA first which is nothing more than a bigger seat and free food. Ordered SW Chicken salad but got tasty beef with noodle instead. First class fare is not reasonable. If purchased separately way too expensive for what you get.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA838 NRT-SFO Biz class. This is a long haul flight with amenity bag. Japanese food selection was Okay. Mid flight snack was placed quietly in a galley. Good thing was the arrival lounge at the SFO to freshen up and shower after landing. This lounge closed at noon and quite difficult to locate. It is on a lower level on the way to terminal 3 if you walk from the international terminal. Info desk did not know about the UA arrival lounge.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA 837 NRT-BKK Biz. Sat on the upper deck to avoid the large Biz crowd. Flight was so packed. Hope UA consider to continue its operation to BKK again in the near future. Food was mediocre with beef steak. Japanese crews were polite and nice.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;I recently flew from SFO to Cancun and back. First off I had to pay for poor entertainment offered inflight when other airlines offer better entertainment for free. I mean I paid for movies that I can't even pause when I use the restroom (ridiculous). Secondly no food was served for this long flight. Even some chips or light snacks would have helped. Thirdly the seats were meh I have had better seats. It is a forgettable experience except for the bad parts like the entertainment system. If given the chance I will not fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA838 BKK-NRT Biz class. Flight was packed. Wonder why UA would discontinue BKK with the planed loaded with passengers. Laid flat seat. Sat on the upper deck near the cockpit. UA Biz were pretty crowded. Food was mediocre. Breakfast choices were Thai noodle or omelette. Grilled sandwich prior to landing was delicious.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA79 EWR-NRT Biz-First. This is a long haul flight about 14 hours on a Boeing Dreamliner with staggered seats. Would have been nice for privacy but unfortunately seated next to a guy who had cold and sneezed around most of the time. Mid flight snack placed in the galley was minimum. When I went there most were gone. Toilet was poorly stocked with only 1 liquid soap bottle. Flight crews were nice. Amenity kit came in a lousy tin can but it is said to be a collectible one.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-19;UA29 14/03/14. Friday evening departure from Newark and the airport was busy however the check in and bag drop facility was well organised so wasn't queuing long. Onboard the flight the 777 was full so it did feel quite claustrophobic the seats were not very comfortable but the legroom was ample. The flight only took 6 hours 15 minutes but the cabin crew were friendly and worked really hard and managed the meal service and two drinks runs before turning the lights off. Breakfast was served an hour and half before landing and consisted of a warm croissant and a small fruit salad. The flight landed ahead of schedule in to Heathrow and I was again fairly impressed with United.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-18;March 12th 2014 flight UA200 was okay but we landed in Houston an hour late and were told our connecting flight UA5189 was cancelled. We were at Terminal B and at this point the service provided by United Airline Airport staff was very poor. Instead of providing us with a direct flight to Toronto we were put on 2 connecting flights these were delayed repeatedly until they were cancelled. We finally asked after waiting for 2 hours if there were any other flights to get home. We were put on an Air Canada flight to Toronto leaving at 2pm but told to go to terminal D to secure our seats and boarding passes but then were told to go to another Terminal and eventually found out this flight was leaving on March 13th a day later not 2pm on March 12th. Finally we went to counter 1 where a staff member helped fly us back to Toronto. We unfortunately had a 2nd overnight flight and although we left Honolulu on March 11th at 7pm we only landed into Toronto 6.45am Thur March 14th. The only saving grace was Air Canada offered free movies. We flew UA1715 and UA219 March 4 2014. Very long uncomfortable flight-no entertainment unless you paid. Very poor experience.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-18;UA28 9/3/14. Noticed online that aircraft had been changed from 777 to a 767-400 which wasn't an issue as the 400s have AVOD entertainment similar to 777 and are far superior in comfort than the older 767-300. The service on this flight was good after the food service there was plenty of drinks runs and the cabin crew were happy to oblige when you went to galley for more. I only purchased one alcoholic drink on this flight as united charge $7 for a beer which in my view is a bit steep for a long haul flight but typical of an American carrier. Having flown with united before I knew what to expect and I wasn't disappointed and most importantly I got from a to b at a reasonable price.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-18;March 8th 2014 myself and 6 family members and friends were scheduled to fly at 3.15pm from Punta Cana to Newark. Of course the usual 45 minute delay in boarding was to be expected but by the time we got onto the tarmac and boarded the plane there was additional 2 hour delay. Finally by 9pm 6 hours after we were supposed to depart we were told the flight was canceled and would be rebooked the following day on flight 1762 at 2.20pm. Back through customs back to pickup up our luggage and then most of the passengers went onto a bus to a hotel to be returned the next day where the process was started again. 2 more hours to repeat check-in of luggage security and immigration. To add insult to injury United canceled another scheduled flight on Sunday and stranded 200 other customers so we could fly out. Boarding in the 90-degree heat they revealed to us that there were new mechanical problems with the replacement plane. They delivered us back to the terminal where we sat like cattle again without any information at all. This was by far the worst travel experience I have had in 40 years of traveling. United airlines gave only an empty apology by text message on our arrival in Newark referring us to a website to claim a minor token gift which could never compensate us for disastrously poor customer service. The 2 lost luggage bags that arrived 24 hours after we arrived in Punta Cana the week before seemed almost trivial in comparison. What a shame!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;Birmingham (BHX) to West Palm Beach (PBI) via Newark (EWR) Business Class. Outbound 25 Feb Inbound 10/11 Mar. Reading some of the reviews about United it would seem to be an airline to avoid however as it flies from my local airport I am more than happy to fly with them. The flights listed above all departed on time or within 10 minutes of schedule all arrived early allowing for hassle free connections. The service by both check in staff and onboard staff was perfect a lot of passenger complaints for this airline relate to staff attitudes well the attitude question works both ways some passengers are downright rude to check in and cabin crew. I have one or two gripes about the flights I am amazed at what is allowed on board as hand luggage are these people so important that saving a few minutes by missing baggage reclaim is of paramount importance to them. The entertainment system was not fully functional on the international legs. All in all the whole experience was a pleasant one I would recommend this airline for people in the West Midlands flying to the US albeit travelling in Business makes a difference but the premium economy and economy cabin looked to be ok as well.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;On return flight to Denver plane waits for 15 minutes at DIA as ground crew is on break and between shifts even though docking space is open and available for our plane. The one checked bag I had on a direct flight from Calgary did not make the plane even though I arrived for check in at Calgary in plenty of time. As this was a small United plane it was oversold. With so many carry ons checked in below I and multiple other passengers had their luggage shifted to another plane. After waiting at the baggage carousel for 30 plus minutes all 3 lost baggage claim stations at DIA were unattended on a Sunday afternoon for over 30 minutes. When staff finally sashayed out the baggage reps stood for several minutes behind their computers talking to no one. The last 6 United flights in the past year that I and my family have taken have all resulted in some form of delays lost luggage or rude staff. I did not receive my luggage until 50 hours after my flight landed.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;Flew SLC to ORD then ORD to DCA both flights were great. The crew on both were very friendly and professional. We arrived early on both flights. I was in economy plus so plenty of leg room. Direct tv was available on ORD to DCA leg. I have flown a few of the discount airlines lately and was reminded how nice it is to fly United. Great trip!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;Travelled to Mexico with a family of 5. United changed our flight to Mexico at the last minute causing our arrival to be over an hour later almost negating our travel to our resort. The morning of our return I received email confirmation indicating that our connecting flight from Newark to Syracuse was cancelled. During several hours of trying to reach them and receive a new flight to get home we were finally told that we would have to stay in Newark until the next available flight. Our flight from Cancun to Newark we wanted the inflight entertainment and wanted to pay for 3 screens. Between the armrest functions not working or the unit not recognizing cards we were only able to get one screen to work. My seat was actually broken and kept reclining back on its own. When we arrived in Newark on Wed March 12 2014 we were advised that we would be able to come to that airport to standby over the next few days in order to get one or two out at a time. We are a family of 5 with two daughters. We then were told that we could fly out on the 17th of March 5 nights later at our own expense. The cancellation 13 hours before was apparently for weather but when we landed the weather was a little bit of rain. We ended up renting a vehicle one way to Syracuse from National and a 4 hour drive later we were in Syracuse. I have flown United before without issue and were extremely disappointed with the airline on this trip. I will not be flying United next vacation that is for sure.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;Flew VIE-FRA-IAD on 5 Jan 14 all economy. First leg was on LH1237 on a A321 second leg UA933 on a B777. Was prepared for a steerage experience on UA but felt the economy seat was surprisingly comfortable and the dinner ok as well. However there was a charge for wine/beer on this international flight of 9 hrs. I contrast this with the LH flight from VIE: complimentary sandwich and complementary wine/beer on a 90 min. flight! Try getting that on a US domestic flight!;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;YQB-ORD on 13 March. One reason for such low rankings is that I never actually ended up on a UA plane. Scheduled to fly out on the non-stop from Quebec City to O'Hare at 8am. The day before UA emails me that the flight is cancelled and they put me on a flight at 11.50am via EWR. Nope - not on United. Online showed the plane from EWR on-time into YQB but it never landed. Around 11.30 am the departure board shows a 3 hour delay for departure. There is not a single UA rep at the gate - and no one ever shows up to tell people what is going on. The pilots and flight attendant who are to work the trip to EWR didn't have any idea and were embarrassed that one heard it was a mechanical problem while the other heard it was weather. Every other airline into YQB was operating on-time or with 10-15 min delays due to snow in Quebec - all but United. I spent over an hour on the phone with my corporate travel trying to get on another flight - the first United agent wouldn't help my travel agent so she called back and got someone else willing to help. I ended up on Air Canada to YUL and then to ORD. Air Canada was fantastic! United - what is wrong with you? I never say never but unless it is mandated I fly on UA I won't do it. I was Platinum with them last year and Gold this year but I'll stick with American or Air Canada.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-17;"UA5713 New York City NY - New York-LaGuardia (LGA) to Washington DC - Washington-Dulles (IAD) on 3/13/14. The new round of checks on size of carry on is being handled in a way that has convinced me that I should never fly United again. While my bag was not over the size the agents take joy in making you size it and have the ""got you"" attitude. I am convinced the lack of space in carry on bins will no longer be a problem because any business traveler or preferred customer will have enough sense to fly with another airline. It is amazing how far United will go to alienate it's good customers.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-14;"I flew to Nashville via a connection in Houston. The first flight a 60 seater was overbooked by 7! The gate agent was totally overwhelmed. When I said I might ""volunteer"" to give up my seat she asked what the code for Nashville is. Agent came on and off the plane a dozen times before we finally left 15 minutes late. Return flight from Nashville to Houston was cancelled and the robot computer rebooked my for 5.40am the next morning. All flights on original travel date were overbooked. Got to Nashville Airport and half of UA's Expressjet flights were cancelled or delayed. Every gate had the wrong flight posted and they reshuffled right before departure. Aircraft taxied for 15 minutes then sat on the runway for 20 minutes. Not one word from the cockpit. Upon arrival in Houston we sat for 10 minutes until someone showed up to pull up the boarding bridge.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-13;We had a connecting flight from Chicago to Montreal at 7.30pm and boarding time was at 7.00pm. Got to the airport 2 hours before our flight and decided to get a bite to eat in the terminal but first we checked the screens and our flight was on time. Left the restaurant 30 mins before boarding when we go to the flight screens we had seen that it said cancelled we did not understand why? Told that the crew had not shown up and that there were no other flights available meaning we were stuck in Chicago until the next morning. 5am wake up to catch the new flight they had scheduled us on. Got to the agent at our gate and saw the agents panicking told it would take 30 minutes to get the problem sorted. To top it off my father booked a first class seat the plane did not have a first class so he asked for an exit row seat however they wanted to charge him almost 40$ when he had already had a first class seat to begin with.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-12;"Booked a flight in December 2013 for a trip to Palm Springs in March 2014 - at that time had seat assignment - little did I know that booking in advance does not guarantee you a seat on the flight - they over booked the flight and I was bumped off my 7 am flight and spent 15 hours in San Fran airport compliments of United Airlines. Waited all day to get on a standby flight (7 that went through that day all over booked) - would have been bumped from the 11 pm flight they rescheduled me on (after bumping me in the am) had I not checked to make sure I was ""guaranteed"" on the flight. Make sure that when you check in your ticket has a seat assignment - if it says ""see agent"" make sure you go early and hopefully get it taken care off - What a terrible disregard for peoples time from United. Feel bad for the ticket agents who I watched all day get yelled at by others who were bumped unwillingly!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-12;Possibly the worst airline to fly internationally. Such a shame compared to other European and Asian airlines. Traveled on the ORD-MUN. Flight was delayed due to leakage in cargo. Apparently they found it after every one boarded the plane. Planes are ageing. Entertainment system kept rebooting automatically. Each reboot taking 5 minutes. Service was pathetic. FA's never tried to help. Beverage rounds were few and in between. Overall has been a very bad experience whenever I have flown United. Avoid it like plague.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-12;I am forced to fly by United Airlines from were I live because they are the only airline at my local airport. I haven't flown them on an international flight since the late 90's. It was a bad experience then my latest trip was even worse. If you're looking for bad seats bad meals people who hate their jobs then this is your airline. They charged me an extra fee of $100 (USD) for my extra check in bag. I had to pay high prices for any drinks with alcohol on an International flight. They flew us home (9 hour transpacific flight from Tokyo) with a fixed cabin TV screen. No power outlet for electronics and flight attendants that made you afraid to ask for a drink of water.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-11;Returning to Michigan from Waikiki we got to Chicago where we found out that the plane to Detroit was cancelled. When we went to the service desk they acted like they did not care told that we could be put on stand by until the next open flight in 3 days had a seat. Their customer service was rude and uncaring. Luckily our travel agent called American Airlines and got us a flight in one hour.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-11;I had the worst experience with this airline. I frequently fly between Hartford and Columbus. All flights out of Columbus and Hartford have a very poor on-time percentage around 40%. My return flight had been boarded with a broken air plane which led to everyone de-boarding and boarding a second plane. In return many people on the plane missed their connecting flights from the delay and had to be rebooked and stay at a hotel overnight including myself. My morning flight the next day had a delay that cost be a full business day at work. This is just one of many times I have had trouble with this airline I will not be flying again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-10;Flew United SYD-SFO in Economy Plus. Paid $200 for exit row seat so unlimited legroom. Staff business like but not rude. Soft drinks offered soon after takeoff. Dinner was basic but that was actually welcome - steamed chicken 4 slightly shrivelled chips veg tiny Apple pie drinks offered again. Water was offered twice during overnight and a midnight ham roll and Tim Tam for those awake. Breakfast was omelette and barely recognisable sausage. IFE was shared screens but I used iPad. Overall not as unpleasant as I had feared.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-10;Flight from Midland to Salt Lake City was great. Both planes were small but that was fine. The crew were great and the reason I purchased the tickets was because it was the fastest flight. The layover was short and it was easy to find my next gate. We left and arrived on time. On my way back however totally different! I had a 6.20 flight and arrived at the airport at 4.30. The line for United Airlines was so long it extended the length of the terminal and out of the door. I stood in line for 1 hour and 20 minutes! No information given and the line did not move very quickly at all. Finally at 6 am a woman working for United started walking down the line asking if anyone was going on the 6.20 flight to IAH. Over 30 people left the line to stand in yet another line for an additional 10 minutes. No explanation was offered no apologies given. We were rushed through first class passenger line of security and I boarded the plane at 6:15 am. The plane was half full because everyone was still waiting in line. Our flight left at 6.45 because we had to wait on all the other passengers. The pilot did his best to make up time in the air and I made in time to make my connecting flight. I still have no idea what happened in SLC it seemed to me like a lot of laziness and poor customer service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-10;Flew Dublin - Newark - Washington Dulles on 6th March on a B757 and then a D8. The cross Atlantic flight was fine on time reasonable seat good choice of movies etc. but the food was very poor - potatoes hard as was the bread no choice - it was meat or meat. On the hop from Newark to Dulles I was surprised how noisy it was though I was close to the engines. United seem to call people forward now by group number as printed on there boarding pass as opposed to seat number blocks. Not sure it helps and fail to see the logic of filling from the front back - getting the people at the back in first means less blocked aisles.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-07;It has taken me in excess of an hour to resolve what should be a simple matter on the phone with their customer service flights are always late (which I understand is not always the airline's fault but most of my late flights result from insufficient crew which they can do something about). The coach cabin is a mess and even first class which I usually take is sub par. Last time I flew first class they gave me a hard time when I asked for milk for my toddler children! Not to mention that they ran out of food. I already had low expectations for them but I did not expect to bring my own food to first class. Avoid at all costs.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-07;NRT-BKK. Uneventful trip on a route about to be abandoned by United. Surprising considering the 747 was packed to the brim. Boarding was chaotic and those of us in business class had no idea where to line up to board. Nice hard product but uninspiring service and meal. Overworked flight attendant working business class in the dome got the job done though. Pilot had Channel 9 (air traffic control) activated which is one of the nice features that only United can claim. The RCC lounge at NRT has much to be desired - hands down had the worst cappuccino in my life there.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-07;"Flew from Newark to Denver where United decided without any form of communication to hold 2 of our bags to arrive with the next flight to Denver 3 hours later. After arriving in Denver we waited at the baggage carousel for nearly an hour until we were fully convinced 2 of our bags did not make the flight. Throughout the night we tried calling different customer service numbers of United and could not get a straightforward answer. 20 hours later our bags reached us. On our flight back from Denver to Newark the entire flight was boarded seat belts fastened welcomed by the pilot until another announcement from the pilot came on and I quote ""there is a small problem. Should be a quick fix that will take best case 30 minutes"". 10 minutes later we are told to deboard the plane because this ""quick fix problem"" has caused the plane to be completely out of service. As we all deboard our entire flight is told to go to one customer service desk with 4 representatives. Nearly an hour later we finally get up to the representatives and all I hear is a potential flight to Houston reboard the out-of-commission plane at 3.30 or wait until tomorrow. Save yourselves the trouble and aggravation and never fly United Airlines!";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-06;LAX-JFK and return. Never flew United previously so after reading many reviews had lowered my expectations. I thought it was pretty good. I paid extra for more legroom which was well worth the money. Cabin crew came through the cabin regularly offering water or juice on the JFK-LAX leg in particular. The seats are more comfortable than Qantas economy and likewise the entertainment was a bit better also. My biggest complaint is the amount of luggage/baggage United allow passengers to drag onto the plane. If you are Group 5 (aisle seats) and the last to board all the bins are full of people's stuff from seats away! Even a pre-boarding offer to check wheelie bags for free due to a full flight was met with disinterest. It really is one area needing tightening up.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-06;Traveling out of New Orleans Louis Armstrong airport for business around 2 pm on 3/5/14. Baggage check was totally disorganized. I was directed to a kiosk by one of the agents then waited 15 minutes after I had checked the bag electronically for someone to come and tag it. When an agent showed up to tag the bag they were clearly not in a hurry. Then my flight was delayed. Maybe there's no rush at check in because United flights are late so often.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-06;Washington to San Diego and San Francisco to Washington. Old planes not enough overhead storage for the amount of cabin luggage they allow people to lug in. One stewardess had a shouting discussion about the oncoming superbowl from the front of the plane to row 39. No free food on a 5 hour flight no drinks except water and fruit juices of doubtful quality. Online entertainment is a joke! Never again!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-06;Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-06;"LHR-IAH-GUA. Prebooked upgrade 3 wks before travel. Check in easy with assistance from staff. Flight left on time and arrived on time in Houston. Flight attendants were friendly and the food was pretty average. You pay for your own alcohol which I don't have a problem with but theirs is expensive. Entertainment selection ok. Prem econ seats offer nothing more than extra legroom about 4"" but was worth it on long haul. Nothing to complain about there and using Houston for transit we were impressed with the speedy immigration channels which took much of the hassle out of using the States. IAH-GUA also on time and again a typical short flight with nothing special but nothing to complain about.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-05;I used to like flying United but the last couple of trips have really make me think about other airlines. I had to fly to Honolulu in January to take care of my mom for 2 weeks. They canceled my departing flight. My flight from Houston was delayed 2 hours and there was no personal TV on the flight. Flying home it was the same. I had to return to Honolulu in Feb. The flight to and from had no personal TV. I am not a savy personal and do not have I- pads or any personal electronics (and there were many other people like me on the plane) so using Wi-Fi did us no good. Sitting on the plan for 8 hrs plus with no entertainment really did not go over well.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-05;May 27 through June 10 2014. The customer service for this airline really needs to be greatly improved. I book my flights in advance so I can have what I want and schedule what I am doing when I get there. So to have my flights canceled and rebooked for a flight that doesn't even come close to when my connecting flight leaves the airport is a bit stupid. Now I have to have a longer flight just to get where I want to go by flying in the opposite direction of where I want to go. To top it all off I wasn't even notified of the change. Now I have to change my plans so I can accommodate the airlines wishes. Next time I think I will book with another company that I have had no problems with.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-05;LAS-LAX-RNO. One way trip at the last moment due to family matters. Had enough miles in the bank to make this work. The schedule was perfect albeit a change of planes in LAX but only a short layover. Took off from Vegas a few minutes late. A short flight from LAS to LAX and the flight attendants passed by twice with beverage service. The plane was comfortable the flight good and we were in LAX before I knew it. Connecting flight from LAX to RNO was fine. Another short jaunt and again the attendants made two beverage stops. I brought my own food on to the plane so I was good. I know problems can arise that are out of our control but maybe I am one of the lucky one's. United has always done right by me. I know if I board a plane with a smile and say hello I will get that right back. I don't always expect the flight crew to be lavishing over me in economy by any means. A smile on either end goes a long ways. I have done many short and long hauls with United over the years and only once did I have an issue. United has treated me well and has my business.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-05;I've been a United 1K member for 2 years 7 year Platinum member on Continental prior to the merger of the two airlines. I fly over 100k miles a year on business and used to enjoy flying however over the past 3 years United has been a nightmare to fly and do business with! Loyalty means nothing customer service is non-existent and upgrades uncommon. Schedules are terrible with multiple connections expensive tickets and they're flying more and more excruciatingly uncomfortable regional planes! Been flying a different airline starting this year since they offered elite status for flying a few thousand miles during a certain timeline so far so good!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-04;"Hong Kong to Newark on March 1. Flight crew was tired and cranky with bad attitudes across the board. One in- flight announcement was literally a snide ""buckle your seat belt it's bumpy"". Where other airlines turn a galley into a quasi-lounge area during such a long flight (15 hours) we were told there was to be no loitering around the galley or toilet areas. I will avoid this airline as much as possible in future. The only positives were the entertainment system and that the flight was on time.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-03;Traveled to Denver from Rochester NY on United twice in the past month. Every plane had a mechanical problem resulting in having to re-book multiple flights because of missed connections. In January I sat on the Tarmac for 3 hours in Rochester because someone had forgotten to drain the water out and it took that long to de-ice. On my return flight from Denver I had to be re-booked 3 times due to mechanical issues and sat in the airport for 8 hours. The only reason I finally got out was because a connecting flight from Idaho landed too late and they refused to hold the plane. In my most recent flight out of Rochester in February the altimeter was broken and we waited 6 hours for parts to be flown in from Atlanta. Oh and - I had paid extra for aisle seats in Economy Plus and ended up in the middle seat in the back of the plane. Now I have to contact Customer Service as no one in the Service Center in the Denver Airport is authorized to do so. I am dreading the return flight home. I will be flying on other carriers from now on.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-03;"Just arrived at my hotel after a horrendous 24-hour trip from Montreal to Honolulu. The missed connection and re- routing through LAX was bad enough but I guess winter weather is a reality. What is not acceptable is this new DirecTV-United deal for in-flight ""entertainment"". Now in addition to having to pay extra for a poor sandwich wrap they've got the gall to make you cough up extra to watch a movie. I object to paying for what is standard on other airlines. They take your money $1000-2000 and then expect you to pay for a movie - or even a flight map. Of course they'll say it's only $6-8 for DirecTV and provides access to many TV channels as well.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-03;My wife and a friend were flying to San Francisco last night and their flight was delayed from 8pm to 9.30pm. When they were finally on board they found that no meals of any kind were available on the 5 hour flight to the destination. My wife was only able to get two small glasses of water and a glass of tomato juice. If this is a sample of the way that United Airlines treats it's passengers these days we won't be booking any travel with them in the future.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-03;United cancelled our flight to Florida about 16 hours prior to our trip. You would think that with 16 hours to work with they could find a way to get a plane to the city I live in. Our travel agent had to scramble to make alternate arrangements with another airline. Now we are going to have to spend over twelve hours travelling and stop at one more airport. I am very angry with United's lack of compassion with our dilemma and diligence at arranging alternate flights to get us to our destination. I will never book with United Airlines again!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-03-03;EWR to AUA round trip business class. The flights were the flights from hell. The crew was unpleasant. The plane was very old and should have been retired long ago. The food if you want to call it that was awful to say the least. I'm easy going and I couldn't find anything positive to say. Save your money and never go UA business class.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-28;EWR-ZRH onboard 767-400. Rolled away from gate right on time landed in Zurich one hour early. 2-1-2 business class configuration great if traveling alone. Had center single seat which was comfortable and private. Classic movies on IFE was wonderful. Food was decent. Service was efficient but indifferent. Definitely no smiles.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-27;My wife and 22 month old son are about to board a 14 hour flight. United is only offering one meal service over that 14 hour period and they won't give any food to my son because he's on his mothers lap and doesn't have his own individual ticket. Some milk maybe some yoghurt a ham sandwich costs them what maybe $2? It's apparent that that extra $2 is worth more than the comfort of their lowly economy customers. Flying isn't what it used to be.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-27;"Terrible service unless you are some sort of elite status traveler. This airline wouldn't let me pick my seats during on-line check in. Assigned me and my 9 year old son Exit row seats because the flight was completely oversold. When I advised gate attendant that a 9 year old would be in the exit row they stated that I ""shouldn't have agreed to the terms and conditions of those seats"". Told to leave my boarding passes and they would fix it. After 40 minutes everyone else gets on plane I go up to find out what's going on and I'm then given back my original boarding passes and told to get on the plane and they would fix it there. Onboard told to see the 2nd attendant. The 2nd attendant tells me I can't sit in the exit row with a child. An attendant moved 2 people out of their seats into the exit row and then snidely says to me ""See. that wasn't so bad was it?"". I've taken 4 United round trips in the last 5 years and pretty much determined that this kind of attitude is common.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-27;LHR-ORD on 25 Feb. Flight departed on time and arrived 40 min early. 2 of 3 FA's good with prompt service. Third was trying but seemed befuddled at multi-tasking thus often a step or two behind. Nice touch that rather than leave the mid flight option at the galley they did a more formalized service. Food on primary meal was so-so for example my tilapia and shrimp had no tilapia. The per-arrival burrito was actually quite good. Seats were comfortable though a bit narrow and limited space to neighbor.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-26;"EWR (NJ) direct to POS (Trinidad). The United Club was unfortunate and so was the outdated 737-800 (UA1505) that took us to our Christmas vacation. Save your money folks and fly coach. This class of service is not worth the extra cost. I would say the worst part about flying United is the unenthusiastic and unhelpful service. No big surprise to anyone who flies United regularly. I also bought the Premier Accelerator and Reward Accelerator erroneously thinking that I would maintain my Status Match level with this flight. The ""fine print"" here is that the Accelerator is not permitted in achieving status if you're doing a Match but their web site will continually advertise it to you like it is. You will also be allowed to buy this product which I now have deep regret doing.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-25;"Our last series of flights (from the UK to the USA and also within the USA) were quite simply the worst travel experience we have had in over 30 years of being regular international and national travellers. Staff in the business class lounge were unhelpful badly informed and unfriendly. Flight was delayed and we were initially held sitting on board for several hours. Then had to de-board and a few hours later the flight was cancelled. We had to exit through the baggage hall. Despite having a lot of baggage and having already been assured we could leave our checked baggage with United staff one member of staff told us ""we won't look after this anybody can take it and it's not our responsibility and then decided to insist we take our bags out immediately. The hotel United put us in was dreadful. Put on a fight the following day. We used air miles to upgrade to business class: United's configuration of the new extra-slim business class seats is awful. 2x4x2. Paying business class and being stuck in the middle with no dividers between two people you don't know? Hardly classy treatment! Seats are so thin that anyone with broad shoulders will be very uncomfortable. One of the internal flights in the USA was so cold that everyone sat shivering in their overcoats. At every airport in the USA staff were at best ungracious and unfriendly. Everything was too much trouble for them. United has also downgraded its Silver status so that now you only get one free bag not two. It is very sad to see the appalling way that United Airlines' service has plummeted.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-25;FLL to EWR to SFO. UA1024 for the EWR leg firstly the pilot taxied too close to the corner and got stuck in snow. Solved that with a pull out and then the fun started. Pilot came on and said we are rerouted and he doesn't have enough fuel but that he is protesting with the tower. Over an hour later we are at a gate being fuelled. The gate agent refused to assist me in finding another route home since 2 hours had passed and I was certain I'd missed my connection in SFO. No hotel because they said the delay was due to weather not incompetence. The new customer focus they speak of is a facade. Flight was Feb 21. SFO has comfortable chairs but not to sleep on.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-25;I'm currently sitting at the gate for my United flight at LAX. A gentleman came out of the gate off of a flight obviously in a hurry and quickly asked where the connecting flight for Newark was. The staff here looked at him like it was the most inconvenient question in the world. They closed the doors for the tarmac before all passengers were inside which left them outside knocking on the door. Not one member of the staff let them in so an airline customer opened the door which set off an alarm. Again the staff did nothing and let the alarm go off for minutes. Definitely not impressed not to mention every time the gal came over the loud speaker she sounded like se had no clue what was going on. She kept getting flights confused and putting out wrong information. I will make sure I don't fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-25;2 flights Feb 14 and Feb 17 LAX-SFO both last about 1 hour. Check in was a breeze though the process within LAX domestic wing can be a bit testy. Full flight on both ways with only drinks service given on economy. No entertainment system just some random loop of Olympic commercial. Flight attendants are organized and accommodating. Storage was a bit tricky and always a pain since all pax are not checking luggage so it gets full leg room is quite cramped even though I'm only 5'8''. Landing was good and was out the airport within 10 minutes. first leg was delayed 1 hour due to late turn around of the plane pilots were very informative throughout. Flights used ancient 737 and 757 on this leg so it can get stuffy. It wasn't bad but wasn't spectacular either just something that will get you from point a to b without much fuss.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-24;0 for 3! United Airlines failed to depart all of my flights this week on time by greater than an hour. Two of which were in excess of 2 hours. This resulted in my decision to cancel my last leg (which I was going to miss anyway) with them and drive 5 hours in the middle of the night to get to my destination. I didn't want to take the risk of staying overnight and not getting home. Apparently they don't have any concern for their customers and their timelines. Probably won't fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-24;PSP-Houston-Washington-Ottawa. Arrived 1 hour and 45 mins prior to departure. In PSP they had 3 flights (Denver San Fran and Houston) all leaving within 30 mins. They had 3 attendants each flight left without people who were left in line because of the counter delays. Staff were less than helpful. No organization no communication. We got to the gate with 5 mins to spare. On the Houston - Washington segment they arrived with time left on the inflight movie - so no one saw the ending. I will not use United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-24;Really simple flight from Los Angeles CA to Newark NJ at 11.30pm then a connecting flight from Newark NJ to Boston MA (1.5 hrs buffer). Total time should have been 6-7 hours. Problems started in Los Angeles when the gate person told us that there was a mechanical problem on the plane. Many people had connecting flights and so a long line formed. One person was at the desk creating new boarding passes. For some reason it took him about 10000 keystrokes to issue each pass. Two hours he issued a total of two boarding passes. The line became exceedingly long and then he called in a manager who whispered in his ear then left. Another associate came in talked to the associate at the counter and walked away. Flight arrives late and then I have to wait 7 hours for another flight to Boston. Total travel time ended up being over 17 hours. Horrible experience inept customer service.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-24;"Flew FRA-EWR and IAD-FRA last week and I have to confess: flying United is like blind tasting every-flavor beans. Their website and mobile app are an atrocity then again the flights were absolutely fine. The 15+ years old B777s with refurbished 3-3-3 cabins are way more spacious than many of the newer planes though 31"" seat pitch in coach feels borderline cramped. IFE screens are tiny but the AVOD selection is downright impressive. Unlike previous trips the staff were courteous attentive and efficient. Even the meals were rather delicious as far as airline food goes. There was plenty of drinks throughout the flight frequent updates from the crew and we even cut down a 40min delay to an on-time arrival to FRA - altogether an enjoyable travel experience.";POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-21;YWG-ORD-FLL-ORD-YWG. Check seemed more complicated than other carriers but did manage to figure it out. Left YWG on-time. Arrived into ORD more or less on time. Had 50 minutes to get to next gate which was miles away. Got to the gate with about 10 minutes to spare. 4/7 of my group members got seats. Three were put up in a hotel for the afternoon and the closest United could get them to FLL the same day was to fly to MEM. They arrived in MEM only having to drive 13 hours to get to FLL. They were fairly compensated that was the only good part of the outbound trip. On the way back check in was a breeze as it was deserted. Ended up getting to the gate with about 2 hours to spare. Plane was delayed about 25 minutes aggravating but didn't lose any sleep over it. Got into ORD a couple minutes late. My connection to YWG was supposed to be 40 minutes but our plane which was coming in from SAV was 4.5 hours late leaving thus delaying us 4.5 hours. I was insulted as we only received a $7 voucher. The only shop that was open was a McDonald's which was in the American Airlines terminal which was miles away. Winnipeggers don't have much choice in air travel but I will do my best to avoid United in the future.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-20;LAX-JFK EWR-LAX. Pros: two helpful ground agents and warm friendly lounge staff at LAX. Decent IFE and comfortable seat for the 5 hour flight. Cons: Too many to mention but mainly staff attitude about everything. Even the simplest task is completed with a sigh and a roll of the eyes. I've never experienced boarding a flight before while the crew talked amongst themselves and literally ignored passengers boarding - not even a request to show boarding passes. I've honestly never been tested with such consistent disdain by employees of a company to which I'm paying a considerable chunk of money. It got to the point where I just smiled to myself with amusement at their unprofessional and frankly useless and unhelpful manner. I only flew UA as a code share with AirNZ but can honestly say I will never ever waste my time or money again.;NEGATIVE

united-airlines;2014-02-20;"This review relates to a 5 flight itinerary booked with United. Other than flight segment 3 which was with Lufthansa from Barcelona (BCN) to Munich (MUC) the other 4 flights were with United Airlines. The problem started when United had a schedule change which did not allow us a legal connection in Newark (EWR) on the outbound flight to Barcelona (BCN). We received an e-mail from United informing us of a change in time to an earlier flight from Phoenix (PHX) to Newark (EWR) allowing us a legal connection for our flight. This in itself was a bit annoying since we went from an original connection time of one hour to a four hour connection. Unfortunately we ""accepted"" the change on-line which was the first error on our part. The day prior to departing from Phoenix we received the usual message telling us we could print our boarding passes. This worked fine until we checked the boarding passes only to find out there was no longer the priority boarding we had booked and paid for. This resulted in spending over an hour on the phone to United. As it turned out with every segment flown with United it was necessary to go through the whole process of having them reprint boarding passes which showed the priority boarding and then only after we had provided them with proof this had been purchased. As for the flights themselves? The usual experience of dealing with disinterested flight attendants barely edible food and the fact as I was told ""United no longer offers special meals (eg: low cholesterol or diabetic) but does provide a kosher meal for its Jewish and Muslim passengers and a beef free meal for its Sikh passengers. So all in all the poor service of United Airlines appears to be the norm more and more these days rather than the exception which really is a problem for the UA's promise that we are ""flying the friendly skies"".";NEGATIVE

Left EWR on Jan 22 for SFO flight was delayed almost 2 hours (waited about 40 mins to take off) most of the delay was caused by a mechanical problem. Pilot apologized for problem saw mechanic going back and forth down aisle. Had a connecting flight to Sydney with 1.5 hr layover. Notified flight attendant about connection and pilot contacted United to let them know that there were a number of people on the flight connecting to Sydney. Was told plane was taking off ""on time"" Got into SFO in enough time to make connection but sat on tarmac for 20 mins. waiting for gate. No gate agent no transportation - just run. Got to gate at 10.42 doors closed at 10.40. United's response - tough. One flight a day to Sydney. Customer service said EWR flight was delayed due to weather (untrue) therefore no compensation. Was upgraded to First class for following days flight. One hour before departure United takes away our first class tickets and gives seats to United employees (saw the badge) - unbelievable! Don't want to bore you with the return flights but suffice it to say had to spend two nights in SFO of course no compensation.";NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-18;I flew United on domestic US flights 3 times in last month and I am very disappointed by their customer care. They haven't informed passengers that due to delays their connection flight (on the same flight number as from Portland to Las Vegas through San Francisco) would be missed - they knew that before boarding the first plane. Secondly they ignored passengers who had to sleep at San Francisco airport on the floor having all restaurants and half of restrooms closed. When coming back from US to Poland (3 flights - 17 hours) I couldn't check an additional bag (as I should have Star Alliance Silver status) informing me that these were Lufthansa regulations and they have their own united and they don't care or I will have to pay 200$. I was forced to check the carry-on luggage as they found they had no free space onboard. Of course my hand luggage was an appropriate size. I am very disappointed and will do my best not to use United Airlines again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-18;I was very pleased with the service I received on United during the recent bout of nasty weather. I left Charlotte going to Chicago and then onto Duluth MN. My Charlotte-Chicago flight was cancelled due to the weather and the agent here in Charlotte handled things quite professionally. The same held true in O'Hare when flying back to Charlotte. It was snowing pretty hard in Chicago and a number of flights were already cancelled. I asked to be rebooked on an earlier flight that was scheduled to go out. Again the agent handled things quite well. I wish all carriers had airport staff as professional as those at United.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-17;We just finished a trip to Belize from Edmonton Canada. This was our first time using a US airline. We flew with United and we were pleasantly surprised. Our only real issue was that the TV's were not available.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-17;Flight from HNL to Denver has been sitting at gate for 2 hrs and no information given other than cargo door problem. I quit flying United several years ago but booked this flight due to price. Never again. Will now miss my connecting flight to DSM. Will not make this mistake using this airline again. On flight over to HNL the entertainment system did not work.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-17;Worst airline I have ever been on. So far UAL has cancelled 3 flights from EWR to BOS with the excuses being weather crew and now mechanical. That's 3 separate planes. Seats in economy are tight with virtually no movement. I'll never fly them again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-17;Arrived Tullamarine (Melbourne Australia) for long planned family holiday to USA. Informed flight cancelled and next flight was two days away! No apology no explanation. Flights through to LA and then to New York uneventful. Flight home from JFK - baggage issues plane delayed on tarmac for close to two hours no amenities from staff water etc. LA connection end then delayed by non appearing traveller. Flight to Sydney diverted to Brisbane due to low fuel missed connecting flights and luggage 'lost' (arrived 11pm four days later). United never again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-17;GLA-EWR-MCO return. Transatlantic flights were pretty decent considering they were on a 757-200. The staff were friendly enough and the food both ways was fine either chicken beef or veggie option soft drinks free pay for alcohol. Flights in the US were OK with more legroom than the transatlantic flights and both were pretty much on time. Overall a decent enough product if you don't set your expectations too high and with United flying direct to the US from Glasgow I would use them again for the convenience of not flying via London or Amsterdam.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-15;YOW-ORD-HNL-LIH and return HNL-ORD-YOW. We were lucky to have a great inflight crew both ways. Perhaps the inflight crew was in a great mood going to Hawaii and as well maybe a very relaxed crew returning home. Goes to show you what a difference in a great attitude makes. The passengers were also very co-operative. We did leave Chicago 3 hours late. We had to finally switch planes. Good thing that the replacement plane had the same seat configuration which avoided a lot of chaos. Wish all my flights were as positive as this one.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-14;Worst airline and worst customer service anyone can ever imagine. 4 hour delay on the plane then cancellation next morning again 4 hour delay while sitting on the plane and then cancellation. 3rd day waiting for an hour to get my luggage checked in when there were only 3 people in front of me. Staff had no idea. This was from Regina to Denver. By the time we were done with staff we were already late for boarding.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-13;Just returned from a 3 week trip LHR-ORD-SEA returned ACV-SFO-LHR much better flight with united then previous flights in 2013. Inflight entertainment much improved food pretty much the same flew economy plus cabin free alcohol outbound but alcohol charged on the inbound flights. Far greater than Virgin Atlantic will fly United again when I travel in two months.;POSITIVE

united-airlines;2014-02-11;My husband's father passed away 2 days ago. We scrambled to get him on a flight that wasn't too terribly expensive and would get him there in an expeditious manner. He flew from LAX to SFO. The plane he was supposed to be on in SFO had mechanical difficulties. They brought in another plane from Vegas. This second plane had problems as well. It took an additional 5.5 hours for him to get on his way to his family.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-10;Flew LAX-SFO-ORD-LAX last week in First. Had a really enjoyable service and even with a 45 minute weather delay due to incoming aircraft off the east coast still arrived in O'Hare relatively punctual. Outbound aircraft was the 737-900 with Boeing Sky Interior - which is very calming for a 4.5 hour flight. The only drawback was it was so new that the IFE hadn't been installed yet (not a deal-breaker as I normally read/work). Return aircraft 757-200 International config with on-demand. The best part of the trip were the crew. Both directions they were attentive and intuitive. They learned my drink order upon getting settled in and never had to ask again (with repeated re-fills). Menus have been upgraded and for a domestic First it was a great experience and worth the ticket.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-10;Delay of 4 hours then cancellation with another 4 hour wait for customer service on scheduled flight from SFO to HNL is totally unforgivable and there were no weather issues involved. Date of travel was to be 18 Jan 2014 and rebooked on 19 Jan 2014. Definitely cannot recommend United ever again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-10;Took several flights in the last couple of months from EWR-HKG ORD-HKG NRT-EWR. The only positive item is inflight entertainment on the 777. Food: first meal - barely edible snack: unedible (half frozen sandwich) third meal: terrible. Now United have started charging for wine on such flights which last year didn't. Staff: terrible: I was given terrible attitude by a flight attendant didn't respond to several attendant calls for a long time. There are several airlines doing such routes all of them providing far better service than United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-07;Flew from HKG-ORD and ORD to IAD. I had very low expectations on United. Surprisingly HKG-ORD ultra long haul flight has excellent service. Probably this is because the flight is staffed by Hong Kong-based crews. The 777-200ER aircraft has decent AVOD. Food is average but the crews offer multiple drink runs throughout the flight. ORD to IAD domestic flight is normal US standard. Only drink is served. PTV is useless unless you pay to watch Direct TV. Service by cabin crew very average. The experience is 4 star for the international flight and I would not hesitate to fly United if Hong Kong crews serve the flight.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-05;My pregnant wife and I had to fly to Maryland from Hawaii. As we were leaving for the airport I get a notification that the plane was experiencing mechanical issues and the flight was delayed. I contacted them and discussed how our delay was going to affect our connecting flight in San Francisco. I was told it would not be an issue. Upon arrival in San Francisco I learned that was not the case. I was told we had to wait a few hours and was going to Houston where I would be connected to Baltimore. We arrived in Houston and was greeted by another rude employee telling us the delay caused us to miss the connector to Baltimore and would get us a later flight putting us in Baltimore around 10pm and that was our only option. I walked outside to get some air and saw a supervisor at the ticket counter. I explained the story to her she offered to get on a flight that would put us in DC. On our arrival we learned that after what was to be a 12-13 hour flight that turned into a twenty something hour flight zig zagging across country. United did not have our luggage and it was sitting in an airport in New Jersey.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-04;Flight from Houston to SLC on 2/1/2014 a family of six including a 6 year old 4 year old and twin 2 year olds. When we checked in at the gate the gentleman at the gate was very short and rude and bluntly stated that we had not reserved our seating online as required when actually we had several months in advance. He took our tickets and forced us to stand by and wait for everyone else to board the plane every time we tried to ask him any questions he completely ignored and avoided us. After everyone else was on board he shoved some tickets at us and sent us on the plane with 4 small kids and 2 car seats. We were scattered throughout the plane. Fortunately the staff on the plane were accommodating enough to rearrange seating a little in order to get my husband or I as close as possible to our kids but we were still very separated. We also found out that several other families were separated on the plane as well. The entire flight was very stressful and unnerving and after this experience I will never fly with United again based on the treatment of the man at the gate. I would not recommend United Airlines to any families as none of our flights were accommodating to young families with kids and car seats as most airlines are.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-04;Lost bags delayed flights lack of communication wrong allocation of seats (such as row 50 in an airline that only has 46 rows) and rude staff have made my collective experience with United Airlines a negative one. To give them 1 star for each of these categories is a stretch. I wish I had read the reviews before booking so many flights with them as it seems that the rest of their previous customers are just as satisfied as I. Literally days wasted in airports and kilometres walked trying to get answers from staff who clearly are in the wrong line of work given their communication skills. Never again.;NEGATIVE

No food service for 50% of Economy class cabin as crew claimed that ground staff forgot to load enough food for all passengers in this class due to ""holiday mood"".

united-airlines;2014-02-03;Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-02-03;I took United from Paris to Washington DC and then from DC to Richmond VA. The first flight was ok despite no communication or service from the crew. The second flight has one hour delay so far. Not very happy about flying with United. I won't recommend it.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-31;We flew from Newark to Panama City Panama. Flight arrived 30 mins late at 11pm. The flight was OK except for no entertainment as the paying entertainment was not worth it. No free food even that had to be paid for - we didn't. Pilots were pretty uncommunicative and the cabin crew indifferent. The seats are real torture too narrow hard and poor legroom combine to make 5 hours feel like forever!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-30;ORD-FLL on 18 January. Paid for upgrade to 1st class as a birthday treat! Very helpful staff at ORD to assist with check-in. As a Star Alliance Gold with A3 following security checks I was able to use the Club Lounge facilities. Being morning items for a continental type breakfast were available. The lounge was however very busy. The flight boarded on time and departed 30 minutes late due to airport operational issues at FLL. (out of the control of UA) Orders for breakfast were taken prior to departure (2 choices) and delivered in a friendly way while en-route. The aircraft B737-800 appeared new the cabin was clean and comfortable. In spite of the late departure the flight arrived in FLL around 5 minutes late.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-30;Flew Denver to Tokyo Flight left 2 hrs. late (mech) so we missed our connecting flight arrived 9 hrs late. On the way back they changed our seats at boarding and put us next to the bathroom got to hear the toilet flush and the door slam for 10 hours I'll never fly United again.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-29;IAD to DEN. Economy class on a 757. On time for departure and arrival quite good service from attendants. Aircraft sported outdated overhead CRT for in flight entertainment and my audio jack didn't work correctly. Also no wifi or power outlets. Seats comfy but a little small. Had to pay 9 dollars for a large snack which is too much frankly. Fine for the low fare I got but not much else.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-28;We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel. Very frustrating trip with United!;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-25;IAH to CVG: Crowded dirty late with poor customer service from distracted personnel. They act like they simply don't care. If you enjoy riding Greyhound Bus Lines and want to have that same experience in the air fly United.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-25;I purchased first class tickets hoping to make the experience a little better it didn't help. The food on the flight is horrible. You get a snack box which consists of a couple of crackers some cheese spread a fig cookie and some kind of cranberry bar. That is not first class service to me. To make matters worse my bags were lost. It would have taken them two hours to drive it to me instead they had to fly it back then ship it to the correct place. This took about 24 hours when it should have taken 2. To make matters even worse on the flight home my bags didn't make it again. I was told they got put on the later flight. I won't be flying United anymore.;NEGATIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-24;I personally have had few problems with them over the last several months. Recently did DEN-SFO-HNL and back. All flights on time and with early arrivals DEN-SFO segments with newer aircraft with PTVs. The SFO-HNL segments were on the oldest 777 I have ever seen - no food no entertainment nothing for 5 hours is not really acceptable. Crews smiled on all segments and actually seemed happy to be at work which is a change. Ground staff at SFO were also helpful.;POSITIVE
united-airlines;2014-01-24;Flew United 261 LAX to Orlando Economy Plus. No music no movie (not even plug for headset) only ability to purchase wifi for $9.99. Remodelled seats with less padding.;NEGATIVE
