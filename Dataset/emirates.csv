emirates;2018-09-11;" |  During my flight back home to Singapore from Dubai, I was given 41 A seat, so happy that it's located in exit area seat which means a nice leg room. After almost an hour of flying, I decided to watch using the IFE, known as ICE. I was shocked that my IFE monitor is not working plus my remote control. I even borrowed the control of my seat mate to call the attention of the flight stewardess. After few minutes of ""checking"", they finally give up. After almost an hour again, they offered me to transfer seat. Initially, I'm hesitant because I love my seat and its pretty quiet, but I realized that without entertainment for more than 7 hours of flight will kill me. Now, I find myself at 67G, which is also an ""exit"" seat. When I turned on the IFE, it's working, only to realized that I'm in the middle of the plane which means near the 4 engines which makes my flight uncomfortable. Lesson learned, buy a noise cancelling headphones.";NEGATIVE

The lounge of Paris is very average, that of Colombo is zero, and that of Dubai gigantic, soulless but with a permanent service and very attentive. FR: A l’aller un siège qui ne fonctionnait pas totalement, et un nouriture plus que moyenne à l’aller comme au retour. Mais un équipage toujours attentionné.

emirates;2018-09-09;" |  Sydney to Christchurch return. Great service both at the airport and on board. The in-flight meal was very tasty and in generous quantity. Check-in staff at both Sydney and Christchurch airports were courteous, friendly, and helpful. Flight attendants were professional and efficient. I was impressed by their no-frill but pragmatic approach to customer service. Would definitely fly with them in the future.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-09-08;" |  Cebu to Copenhagen via Dubai. Not an airline that cares about there customers. Almost everything went wrong, and Emirates do not care! As we take off from Clark to Dubai I got About 1 litre of water in my lap, so that I had to sit with wet pants most of the way, and on top of that, the entertainment system was defective. They did not have any food for my 16-month-old son, they would have had if he was on the bottle, but he is on solid food so my wife shared her food whit him, or what she got, for the only thing that they got was half a kids meal. So we had to buy some food when we got to Dubai. On the way back the boarding was a complete chaos we were but in a bus for 40 min. waiting or going around in circles, without any information, before we got to the plane, and there it looked like the one that had to be in front in the plane was dropped on in the back, and the other way around.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-04;" |  Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid. Even some cheap airlines gives food that is better than the food served in Emirates airlines and they served the same food in both flights although they were in different times. The seat size is ok but the quality of the touch screen can be improved. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-04;" |  Beirut to Manila via Dubai. I booked my exit seat ahead of time and paid an additional charge of $150USD per way for the seat only to find out that the seat closest to the exit door not only had no window and felt very claustrophobic, but the seat itself was smaller and tighter then all the other seats. On top of all this the seat itself was defective as it would not recline and stay reclined. When I told the pursuer of this issue he said he will refund my money and file a complain but i neither received any refund nor did he show me any filling of any formal complaint. Actually i never saw him again throughout the whole 9 hour flight. At the Duty free airport in Beirut I had purchased some food stuff and other items  to hand carry to dubai. When i was boarding the flight from Dubai to the Manila a man stopped me and asked me to weight my hand carry, he said that the hand carry was acceptable since I already brought it from Lebanon but my Duty free items which weighed 7 Kg more was to be charged an additional $35 USD per kilo totalling $245 addition charge.  No one said that if you buy anything from Duty free you will be charged for additional weight.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-02;" |  Entebbe to Dubai. The ""worst experience"" as posted before from Rhianna Miller can still be topped! Not only did we have same problems with not working TVs generating heat - unbearable dryness - non-english announcements, no meaningful security briefing - a mini veggie lasagne handed over without a tray for a 6+ hour stay in the plane - a seat spacing which was meant for people under 160 cm only - back rests which could not recline at all, no pillows nor blankets. I booked Emirates (EK2447) for their service quality, and got this horror.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-01;" | Do not fly Emirates! I booked a first class ticket Singapore - Kuwait. I ran through several issues. First, as a first class passenger I was unable to change my flights online (I had to go through the inconvenience of visiting the nearest Emirates office to do that.) Is this for real? And you expect me to return as a first class passenger Emirates? Second, the service was horrible! Can you believe it took them over 20 minutes to prepare breakfast for me? When I asked for the cause of the delay they claimed that it took time to heat the meal. However, when I ran back to the galley to take sugar for my hot chocolate I found 5 or 6 cabin crew having a meal and chatting together rather than looking after their first class passengers. I do not think I would ever pay again for a first class ticket for Emirates, nor do I recommend any one to fly First Class with Emirates. Very bad tasted has been left in my mouth. No compensations offered.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-01;" | Flew Beirut to San Francisco via Dubai. Not all of us can fly business across continents, and with the reviews I read on Emirates, I thought this would be the best option to travel to SFO in Economy. It's an A380 and the flight was extremely uncomfortable. Every inch was used and leg room was not considered, I am not a tall person! The food was below standards, and I can compare with many airlines, the cabin smelt unacceptable, over booked and way too many carryons to find a space for my own! I travel a lot and have experienced many airlines. It's a shame really that all this hype was for nothing. The A/C was visually clean, as were the restrooms, service was not too bad and the entertainment is what made me survive the flight. I was thoroughly disappointed, and will not be doing that again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-09-01;" |  Gatwick to Dubai. I've noticed a drop in customer service over the years I've flown with Emirates and now it's going back up. This flight was the second leg of two flights to and from DXB and LGW. Service was exceptional, especially ground service. Service at Dubai on the first leg was and is never as good as London, but still very polite. Seats seemed comfortable, and tv screen was new. Service was very good onboard. Food was yummy lunch of sausage peas and mash potato, and the beverage cart came round once and I noticed that they were skipping rows with the drink cart. Duty-free shopping magazine was OK. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-29; | Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference. Overall an outstanding pair of flights yet again and I really enjoy flying long haul with Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-28;" |  Kuwait to Lyon return via Dubai. I usually fly with Qatar Airways in Business class but they don't offer this route yet. I was terribly unsatisfied with Emirates product on these flights. First, the 2-3-2 configuration on their B777-300 is outdated and lacks comfort and privacy. The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized. Last, the internet on board was not working on any of the segments. I am totally disappointed in this airline which markets itself as one of the best. I'll definitely be flying other airline next time and be treated as a business class passenger.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-24;" | Flown a total of 4 legs (Hamburg to Beijing via Dubai) with 36 persons together booked individually. Check In process was rather complicated because of pre-assigned seats but managed to pack the group together. Luggage drop off in Hamburg was very unfriendly and machine like by AHS staff with shouting throughout the terminal. But Emirates representative was very friendly and helpful with checking in 36 baggage pieces. Flight experience was superb. Several services were offered on all flights and asking for beverages in the galley was possible at all times. Paper menus were offered. Friendly and multi lingual cabin crew on all legs. Very caring for 5 ill kids throughout leg PEK-DXB. Greetings and good bye with not only professional smile. We were afraid of B777 10 abreast configuration - a bit tight but not cramped at all with 6'1"" height. Living space in A380 was superb. Partly bad reviews could not be verified using Emirates on those 4 legs.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-24;" | The service provided by Emirates on both the outbound and the inbound journeys far exceeds what is offered by other carriers flying transatlantic routes to Europe from the East Coast. Both flights left and arrived on time. On both outbound and inbound we were offered two full meals (breakfast on outbound could use improvement), hot towel service, high quality reusable amenity kits, free alcoholic drinks, mood lighting (including a unique 'starry sky' effect when the cabin was dark), and top notch in-flight entertainment which included live camera views from the front and bottom of the aircraft. Economy passengers were also offered free in-flight wi-fi up to a certain amount of megabytes (more than enough to instant message friends and family on the ground with travel updates). All of this for a price that was significantly lower that that of US and Europe based carriers. This was my second time flying this route and I look forward to my next trip with Emirates.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-23;" |  Colombo to Newark via Dubai. I started flying Emirates airlines beginning of this year, I was able to upgrade my seat to business class through their promotions on both my trips to south-east Asia. When it is possible to do so, I will plan all my future airline travels through Emirates. The business class service is elegant, the cabin crew is professional and very efficient.  There was a variety of gourmet food options(but I did skip some of the meals as I was not hungry). I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional local Arabic mezze entree. Business class comes with other perks, like the fast track through security, which allowed me to avoid long lines. Emirates sure sets a very high standard for traveling by air in style.";POSITIVE

Almost missed the connecting flight, have to run to the connecting flight, it was delayed more than 20 min in Bahrain, the aircraft aircon was switch off, citing problem with engines, it always happen in summer, shouldn't you know the problem during the last summer, why do it let it happen again? From Dubai to Singapore, have to ask 3 time for a class of coke, in the end after 20 min I got 2 glass of coke - it is not meal serving time it is not busy, cabin crew, busy chattering at the back of the cabin. I am in economy class, they ignore your request. In flight entertainment is good, enjoy the selection.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2018-08-20;" |  Amsterdam to Male via Dubai. Disappointed. Somehow there is a myth that this is a great airline. Legroom is great as is the entertainment system. But with that all is said on the greatness. Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you don’t wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I won’t fly again. Maybe KLM has less legroom and entertainment but the crews are nicer and more attentive. Would advice Emirates to review training and food&beverage setup/process.";NEGATIVE

I have the worst ever experience travelled all the way from Sydney until my last destination. I chose the seat on An aisle. Once I get in to plane they gave me a wrong seat because someone else took it my seat. The crews aren’t good at all, the food was only one meal. This is madness travelled 15 hours only have one meal?";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-17; |  Dubai to Houston. On flight EK 211 that was to leave at 9:30am this morning. Due to mechanical difficulties and poor maintenance capability it is 10:21pm and still have not boarded. There have been 6 adjustments to timing on this flight today causing me to miss meeting in USA due to poor service on this plane. Have been waiting over 13 hours thus far for this flight to take off. Extremely unreliable airline.;NEGATIVE

I have experienced Emirates business class product a few times over the last year and few things have been consistent: poor menu, rushed service, unpersonalized service, rude and poorly trained cabin crew. Any complaints made on their feedback channels (email, website, etc) go without response. For some reason, there is a pervasive myth that Emirates' product is among the top products in the market. I think the service in most airlines far exceeds what Emirates offers, especially in business class";NEGATIVE

emirates;2018-08-15; |  Melbourne to London via Dubai. Early start with EK 409 departing Melbourne at 5.00 am so arrived at airport at 2.30 am to check in. Ground staff were great but warned me that immigration and security would not open until 3.00 am! As you can imagine with a full flight there were hundreds of passengers lined up to go through this process. Was given a priority lane pass which made the progress much easier. Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow. ICE system is brilliant and a great selection to choose from and the cameras on the aircraft are a must watch for landing and take-off. Overall a fantastic long haul experience with friendly crew and great service. Could not recommend more highly.;POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-12;" |  New York to Johannesburg via Dubai. I accompanied my teenage son to a short internship in a private conservation area in South Africa. He was tasked with photographing all the researchers operating in that area and therefore had to take expensive photographic gear. We showed that gear to the Emirates check-in manager in New York, who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg, Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly, telling us that we couldn't take the gear on the plane, that it was a safety hazard, blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas, and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time -- even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund. We had to buy same-day tickets home on Delta -- and by the way, our hand luggage did not come even close to falling out of the overhead storage on that airline. I will never fly Emirates again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-12;" |  Colombo to Dubai. I wasn't blown over by the service orthe food. The plane was old and dated and tv screen didn't work, the rest of the staff weren't very polite and seemed tired and grumpy. I managed to put one movie on, but the screen was blurry and the movie was different than the original. The first leg was a better much newer plane with a working screen, the staff were politer and the food was better. Each time I fly with Emirates, the service goes downhill.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-11;" |  Hyderabad to Amsterdam via Dubai. If you want to pay 210 USD for 7kgs excess baggage (14kg in total), then this is your airline. Youre only allowed 7kgs in cabin, including your laptop! This is ridiculous!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-11;" |  Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasn’t the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didn’t improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didn’t have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we don’t appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old! I think Emirates appear to have forgotten who they are competing against here, it appears they want to compete with budget airlines hence they are using their pricing tactics. A";NEGATIVE

emirates;2018-08-09;" |  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-08;" |  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-08-06;" |  Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They don’t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they don’t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didn’t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs. I have for many years regarded Emirates as the worlds best airline, but after experiencing these cost cutting measures, I will gladly forfeit my skywards miles and go back to Qatar or Etihad.";POSITIVE

The cabin crew were hardworking and friendly, planes clean and modern, entertainment was top notch, food high quality and you aren't made to feel guilty for pressing the call button to ask for more drinks. The only negatives were the fact they ran out of the beef option on the Newcastle to Dubai leg and then the fact we departed Dubai almost an hour late, although this was due to passengers not showing up and needing their baggage offloaded. I would recommend Emirates.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-08-03; |  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai. Food service on flight from Los Angeles to Dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. The staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight. This is not a premium airline - this resembles a budget airline.;NEGATIVE

I'm used to fly with companies such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Malaysia Airlines or Korean Air which provide an excellent service on board and I had similar expectations with Emirates - but I've been pretty disappointed. Regarding flight EK075 DXB-CDG, one of the boarding crew had a really aggressive behavior.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-07-30;" |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold. Needless to say we will never fly Emirates again nor recommend them to anyone.";NEGATIVE

We were all beyond disappointed at the service we received both going to Dubai and coming back to JFK, New York. When coming onboard we found our seats filled with about 10-15 blankets and 6 headseats and 5 pillows. This was the first image we encountered of Emirates. The flight attendant gave us the excuse that other people probably put them there, but never apologized (Aranza). We understand that we did not pay for “first class”, but that does not mean we should be treated any less. How does an airline not pack enough food for a 12 hour and 45 minute flight? Please help me understand.  It has taken years for a company to build its reputation, but seconds to destroy it! We were highly disappointed and I will be sure to never fly with Emirates ever again and will never recommend your airline! They do not project themselves to what they make it seem.";NEGATIVE

There is no chaos onboard but the crew expected to not help passenger if they need help. Then when I press the button then the crew told wait but 10 minutes called another staff but not at all. The good thing about this airline is the service has been improving since the last time I've flown with them few years ago. The shocking is about the staff service onboard which ignores the passengers. ";POSITIVE

Leaving baggage is a practice they love. My baggage went missing again in July in another flight. Traveling through Emirates is just waste of money, time, and all you get is frustration. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-07-19;" |  I had a bad experience with Emirates customer service before in the past and it didn't change. I thought this was a good airline and happily purchased an unaccompanied minor ticket for my son which was expensive already at over 1700$. I gave all required information for pick up etc. to the airline and they assured me that they have all info. Unfortunately, on my sons flying date they needed more info (which they never informed me about) and tried to call me but never reached me and just didn't board my son. The next day I complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500$ to no fault of mine. They said I could get the money back through customer service. I did complain and stated my case but I only received an unfriendly rejection. Therefore this ticket cost me 2300$ which is higher than any other airline. In addition, my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in Dubai due to Emirates fault. He had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later! This unprofessional treatment with poor customer service and delays is unacceptable. Last year I used Lufthansa with my son and no surprises/ unfair increase of rates/ no delays/ no problems- What a difference! ";NEGATIVE

emirates;2018-07-12;" |  I can’t describe how upset I am by being stuck on Fl Dubai plane for 5 hours with no food, drink, in-flight entertainment or internet. I did book Moscow to Hanoi via Dubai  specifically to fly with Emirates, that cost me 650USD one way, compared to Aeroflot 650USD/round trip which is direct, modern and safe anyway. I paid twice as much just to have an experience with Emirates. Instead of Emirates plane I found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. I never been send to a low-cost instead of a full service. How is that even possible a company like Emirates co-shares with a lower cost. By co-sharing I mean they stuck me on a lower cost, send one meal, 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. There was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner, only one option, was not suitable for me, no free snacks available no nothing. I had to buy water and peanuts. I booked a ticket with Emirates for my husband London-Dubai-Hanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. I don’t book planes which sell water and sandwiches and I would never in a conscious mind choose Fly Dubai for a 5 hours flight, seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. It was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available, I couldn’t even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. The whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s, I never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before, our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. I couldn’t even charge my phone up to 60% in 5 hours, the equipment was that old! I have noticed that my flight is operated by FlyDubai on behalf of Emirates on my ticket but I have no idea what FlyDubai is and didn’t expect such a con being pulled off by Emirates. FlyDubai is not the same level as Emirates, if I wanted to fly with FlyDubai, in my case Emirates is a middle-man profiting by using the brand to sell cheap flights at high price.  I complained to the customer service afterwards but they just blamed me on not researching what FlyDubai is. So I guess they are aware of what they are doing but hope that people will be just tricked and book a ticket because of Emirates brand on it. Second flight Dubai-Hanoi was also pretty awful, just got a sandwich, croissant and an omelette in 7 hours flight, was pretty uneatable, the plane was very shabby as well. And at the check-in Emirates even tried to put me on standby because the plane was overbooked, even though I paid for my tickets 2 months in advance. guess Emirates don’t care about their customers as much as they did.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-07-12; |  Auckland to Birmingham via Brisbane / Dubai. The B777 on the Brisbane to Dubai leg was cramped and dirty. The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again. And I don't recommend them.;NEGATIVE

After my original flight from Latam being cancelled last minute (without an explanation from either branch in both countries until the next day after the flight would have left, I was forced to book a last minute (6 days in advance) cheapest flight I could find out of the country. I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations. I question now whether my flight was so expensive because of the additional destination that flight had and I feel slightly cheated. I don't recommend flying with them without speaking to them about all of the details of your flight.";NEGATIVE

With 12hrs flight haul, it is understandable that the trip will be not very comfortable. But, with the crew on board that cannot get you water until to press the button on you seat 10 times and finally they get annoyed by the pings and decide to come ask you how they can help. As one attendant told me we are out of ice. just seconds later asked a different crew member they got me some ice. Seats are tight, you have to lift your shoulders and still touch the person next to you when eating your meal. I have took Qatar Airways before for a similar ling flight and had a very conformable journey.";NEGATIVE

While booking my flight to go home, I couldn't do it on this occasion. Note that this was my first time on Emirates. I checked the website and all it gave was the menu and nothing else. Apparently, I should have given them a call and told them what I wanted for a meal but it didn't say so anywhere. It turns out that I was given fish to eat which i did, not knowing what it was. And when i raised a complaint with Emirates a couple months later, they blamed me saying I should have called them to say so. Nowhere was the instruction given that I need to do that. How am I supposed to know? During the flight, when I got a second meal, that's when I asked and they changed my meal, not even apologizing for the mistake they made. I only got to know after I got home that I had fish for lunch! Disgusting.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2018-07-03;" |  Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious. All-in-all another excellent flight on Emirates, an airline we've been flying regularly since they only had two or three planes!";POSITIVE

The seat is of average space, but your space will be highly deprived when the front seat reclined. The TV appears to be too bright and it hurts the eyes. I could not watch the flight information on some of the flights. The thing that I am most furious is about the online system of Emirates. The website lags and you have very few choice in online check in as all passengers are pre-allocated a seat before check in. Finally, transit in Dubai Airport is a disaster that you could hardly find a way and it seems to be messy. Fortunately, cabin crew speak fluent English and they are international.";POSITIVE

The return journey was delayed at AKL by 6 hours due to tropical storm so missed connection to Gatwickat Dubai. Re routed to LHr via Rome.

emirates;2018-06-29;" |  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid £180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were £1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either. I will not choose to fly Emirates again, over priced and over rated.

As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life, not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight, and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful ''manager''. This is the second time this happened to my husband with this airline and we want to tell the travelers out there not to waste their valuable time and money well earned to throw it to them.

Was hungry getting off a 12 hour flight, which is a rare experience in business on most airlines. Cabin service was lackluster at best - this was the biggest surprise. I had a hard time getting a drink then was offered bourbon when I had ordered scotch. I didn't drink it and after many hours they took it away. Much later in flight, male flight attendant argued with me that the drink had been scotch not bourbon. (I'm pretty positive I can tell the difference) If there was a 'snack' offered late in the flight (that was on the menu) I did not see or hear about it.

I was wheelchair bound and when I arrived at the check in at Melbourne all seemed fine... until I have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate, gate 11 empty, alone and abandoned there. No water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as I needed assistance. When finally an attendant arrived to open the gate, I asked her if I could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and I had to go to another area. I was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. She felt terrible for what I experienced but could not do much about it. She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while “parked” while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait. The guy brought me to another plane where I was left, and almost missed my flight to Venice! When I received an alert from Emirates to go straight to the gate I tried to get attention again!!)!  Arrived at the gate they changed  my seat. Previously I had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and I thought the change was similar. Instead they moved me to seats whose armrest was fixed and could not be lifted making it impossible for my leg to rest flat on the other seats. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-06-15;" |  Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked “upgrade” a message came out that “the system was down”! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years. Emirates has gone so downhill lately which is unbelievable.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-06-15;" | Cape Town to Melbourne via Dubai. Check-in and boarding in Cape Town were smooth. The flight to Dubai on a B777 was pleasant, with a comfortable seat which had adequate storage, and excellent food. The service was efficient but rather formal. The IFE on this flight was quite clunky. At Dubai we were bussed to the terminal, but as there was a dedicated Business Class bus this process was quite painless. Both the terminal itself and the Emirates lounge were very busy just after midnight. The second flight on an A380 was a big step up in luxury, with a more spacious seat, much more storage, more friendly cabin crew and very smooth IFE. Something went wrong with my vegetarian meal order, but it was cheerfully fixed. All in all a good experience.";POSITIVE

Being a Platinum member, Emirates upgrade me from Business to First every 4-5 flights. I rate Business class on the A380 above Business on the 77W, but also better than First. The seat in First remains awkward. To me, Emirates are outstanding for route network, lounges services and catering, website booking/managing, chauffeur pickup, seat comfort, onboard wifi, crews, and of course their unique ICE inflight entertainment. Where Emirates do not get their act together however, is for inflight catering, which remains surprisingly awful also in First. I always eat at the airport before my flight. Not sure why this is so difficult as Qatar, Cathay and Singapore Airlines do succeed in providing their premium passengers with great food.";POSITIVE

Drinks we're served only once in a 16hr flight can you imagine?  Worse from Dubai to Mumbai my 4th trip same airline on that route. This time they started service after 45 min of seat belt sign going off, slow and gloomy faces and No drinks.  They said they have no time, they offered only wine. I'm thinking twice of flying Emirates again. And the food on SFO Dubai was very bad hard and uncooked. Emirates has gone down.";NEGATIVE

My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.  Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the additional charge. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to check in my luggage and didn't allow in the flight.";NEGATIVE

On our way back from Jakarta to Dubai our flight was cancelled and Emirates never notified us. As a result we showed up on time of our original flight only to find out that Emirates moved us to an earlier flight without notifying us. Emirates refused to sit us on another flight and we had to buy new tickets back home all the way from Jakarta to Moscow. Even after that incident for 3 months already I’m struggling to get a confirmation that my flight was cancelled to get a compensation from my travel insurance company. And for 3 months I encounter the heaviest bureaucracy I’ve seen in years. And zero result. Never again I will fly with Emirates.;NEGATIVE

We are told to check-in our carry-on luggage at the gate just before entering the flight in Hyderabad en route to LHR via Dubai. Once we reached LHR one of the checked carry-on bag went missing. We got our bag finally after 3 days of minimal communication from Emirates, only to find out our laptop got stolen along with other food items. Emirates did not inform us about missing stuff when the bag got delivered. Their customer service  responses were canned and totally put the blame on us for checking in the bag. Such a shame!

Furthermore, despite paying quite a substantial amount for the exit row seats to ensure we had extra legroom, on the Dubai to Lisbon leg, the space we paid for was constantly filled by passengers queuing up to have their photographs taken with Emirates service staff. This practice, which appeared to be encouraged by Emirates staff, resulted in great inconvenience to ourselves and many other passengers. The choice of entertainment was also below par.";NEGATIVE

Business class is something Emirates does extremely well and the A380 business class product in particular is outstanding. B777-300ER still good but a 2-3-2 layour (instead of the 1-2-1 on the A380), seats don't lie 180 degrees flat and no personal work space/minibar. Attention from cabin staff, food etc great. Lounge at Dubai was in one of the smaller terminals so not as good as the main business class lounge but connection was short anyway. Overall well worth the miles upgrade";POSITIVE

On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu. ";NEGATIVE

Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing). There were no snacks or beverages in between. No amenity kits provided. There was wifi onboard. 2 hours free. On a positive note, you can check-in 2 bags, 32 kg each. Overall, it was all okay because Emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date. I would be very disapointed otherwise, though.";NEGATIVE

This was a short flight, so my interest in the IFE was limited to the flight map and the external cameras - what a treat! There were so many flight attendants assigned to the business cabin that the service was personalized and super attentive. Once again, I enjoyed the lounge food so much that I had little appetite left for the elaborate onboard meal. I ordered the ""mild"" chicken curry. I should known that my interpretation of mild and that of the Thai catering service might vary considerably. I had contacted Emirates customer service ahead of the flight with a special request. Their communication was exemplary, and they accommodated me beyond what I Had hoped for. The only drawback to this flight that I can comment upon is that it has spoiled me for flying with anyone else. I will have to adjust my expectations.";POSITIVE

They have messed up the seating arrangement for most of the passengers. They changed my assigned seat. It was an aisle seat but they changed it to a middle seat. And again changed it back as I complained after boarding the aircraft. The interior of the aircraft looked old and not clean. The worst part was food. Chicken/prawn curry with rice. These were my options and I choose chicken curry.  Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight. The ticket was expensive so it was surely not a value for money.  It used to be good but now it is a hell in the sky if you have a long flight. Never again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-05-18;" | Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.";NEGATIVE

Upon arrival in Munich, I am informed that one of the seats in the A380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. In addition to that, customer ignored the seating requested. The seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available, because it is a full flight. Never experience like this before on other airline. The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine. The service on the A380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the A380. In the future, I will avoid their A380 because of this issues with IFE etc. I have sent complaint to the airline which I’m still waiting for any replies about this experience.";NEGATIVE

Dubai airport is huge and my husband has trouble walking let alone running. Cabin crew on return flight from Dubai to Manchester were dreadful. We were 3 and a half hours before a drink was offered but we could clearly see the staff in the galley eating and drinking and have a good old laugh. They said nothing when a man walked up the aisle cleaning his teeth with toothpaste and a brush with disgusting bits flying over the other passengers. A horrible experience from start to finish.;NEGATIVE

Crew were very nice telling passengers sat in full rows that there were free rows scattered around the plane that they could move to. Plane was brand new, great seats, great entertainment system. Food was 50/50. On time arrival into Dubai but delayed due to having to go to a remote stand and taking a bus that took 40 minutes! to get to the terminal. Got to the terminal and realised I left my onwards boarding pass on the plane but the staff issued me a new one very quickly. Second flight boarded on time as well however, we were an hour late taking off due to the weather but the crew made up for it. Like the first flight, crew were excellent and the food was a lot better on the 2nd leg. Sat on the upper deck, definitely recommend it as the more private cabin and the side compartments are really good. Overall, great experience with Emirates.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-05-10;" |  I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my  legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible. Touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. If you touch a particular button, you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb. Hence, a difficult screen to control.";NEGATIVE

The flight attendants seemed unhappy and unenthusiastic with what they are doing. They seemed robotic and lacked human compassion that I’ve experienced with other airlines. The seats are cramped with little leg room that I couldn’t even get pass (seated on the window side) without having to wake the sleeping person next to me. I know that economy class isn’t really first class service but I had the best time flying with Qantas!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-05-07;" |  We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However, I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well.  All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at £580 return, but there were many cheaper options available. I'm glad we chose to pay the extra £100 for Emirates as the extra comfort went a long way for such a big journey.";POSITIVE

The Emirates driver picked us up spot on time and delivered us to Amsterdam airport where we quickly dropped our luggage. (We were already checked in using the Emirates app which is very user-friendly). Departure was on time and we were actually more often addressed in Dutch then when flying KLM! There was a large contingent Dutch-speaking flight attendants on board. Even the captain appeared to be Dutch and all announcements were made in Dutch, English and Arabic. Priority cards were given for immigration in Dubai which went quite fast especially considering the huge amount of flights arriving around midnight in Dubai. Luggage was quickly delivered and we were driven by an Emirates driver to our hotel. Whatever negatively influenced the experience was Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Unhelpful and unfriendly security agents, an overcrowded Aspire lounge and a total chaos at the gate.";POSITIVE

There was one compartment was open for the beginning of the aircraft descending and we had to call them to make them aware of how dangerous it is. The bathroom was dirty and not even enough toilet Paper. No crisps no chocolates no peanuts but biscuits! Everybody doesn’t want a roll if you just want to nibble and then you bring your own snacks when you already paid for a ticket and there is Not enough breakfast or lunch or Dinner of Choice.

The number of passengers using the toilets warrants that someone clean the toilets, including the floor, at regular intervals during a 13 hour flight. It is not sufficient to clean only before and after a flight. I realize crew may not see this as within their job but there is something off kilter about handing out scented warm towels, booties and toothbrushes but expecting passengers to use filthy toilets.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-04-29;" | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I’ve used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. Yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category.";NEGATIVE

At no point during the flight booking did it flag up the fact these documents were required. The man on check in  kept referring to the need for a visa to enter South Africa hence the requirement for paper work. You do not need a visa to enter South Africa. Surely the need for birth certificates etc should be flagged on entering each passengers DOB to prevent this happening. I contacted the South African immigration whilst the man continued to deny my daughter and told that they would have had no problem allowing my 16 year old daughter to enter. Still she was refused.

The upper cabin is spacious than the lower cabin with 2-4-2 layout. Add to that the side storage bins for those seating in the window seat. The flight was full because of the Songkran Festival in Thailand. Drinks and a small pack of biscuit was given right after take off. Lunch was serve almost two hours into the flight which i guess is a bit early for a 6 hour flight. Drinks and wet towel were provided before we land. The front lavatory on the upper deck are spacious. Unfortunately, those seating on the upper deck cannot go down the lower deck to roam and stretch their legs. Emirates' ICE is was superb.

emirates;2018-04-23; |  Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonald’s. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline.

emirates;2018-04-16;" |  Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It’s a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant – how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn’t know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don’t need to be necessarily produced if they’re checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don’t need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it’s now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained. What are you going to do about this, Emirates?";NEGATIVE

When customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. Otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. Nearly missed our flight.

The First class cabin was lovely, the onboard Spa was truly refreshing and spacious. I was well looked after by the head purser on this flight. The food and beverage offer were of high quality, and last but not least, the ICE entertainment was phenomenal - you are literally spoilt for choice.

This time (in economy!), I cannot complain at all. Both flights were full full but staff were pleasant and friendly. A nice change from the arrogance the staff often display in business class!";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-04-09;" |  Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that “Computer says” it’s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is...  My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard. In short not worth the effort of flying Emirates!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-04-09;" | This was my first time traveling with Emirates and couldn’t recommend them highly enough. The service was first class and the staff were welcoming and friendly.

Thank you to the cabin crew on the Dubai to Glasgow flight on Saturday 7th April.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-04-06;" | Terrible service. Crew members were all too proud to be serving customers - no smile, no thank you, no please. I don’t know if this was arrogance or they were simply too proud to be serving customers. There were supposed to be a choice of main course, however, all I got was ‘grilled chicken’ without being offered a choice and the meal tray was passed from behind me so I had to turn my back to take the tray. Totally unprofessional. I don’t know what the hype is about with Emirates. I will never travel on Emirates again unless I have to without being offered a choice. I also want to mention that the check in staff at DXB was terrible. Again no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Basically not interested in serving customers.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-04-06;" | Emirates have become a low cost carrier. Flew Christchurch to Sydney on A380 in business class, EK413. Whilst this is a short flight I have paid a premium for business class, Emirates are now at a race to the bottom for service. The A380 business class is the new economy class. There are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. No pre-dinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. Staff were rude and unfriendly. Dinner was inedible and no drink service, again had to ask for a glass of wine and by the time it came out it was the end of service. Last time I flew Emirates I had noticed the deterioration of service. I didn't think it could get any worse.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-04-04; | I was travelling Dubai to Mumbai. At the time of check-in I forgot my passport pouch at the check in counter. I realized that when I was about to board the flight.

emirates;2018-04-04; | Ft Lauderdale to Hyderabad via Dubai. Emirates is the worst airline I have seen so far. Their staff force customers from economy class to pay extra for luggage. I have checked in 2 bags and have a carry-on bag and a laptop bag with me. I had a stop in Dubai. They checked the weight of carry on in Dubai. I made some shopping in Dubai duty free. They are checking even duty free weight and charging extra for that. They made me pay 200$ for 2 kgs extra which includes duty free weight. I will never ever travel again with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-04-02;" |  Bangkok to Sydney. The boarding time was incredibly confusing with the boarding process slightly disorganised. We were  greeted onboard with champagne before take off. Once airborne, the dinner service was incredibly drawn out from taking orders to serving the dishes and drinks. From what I can see most of the cabin crew looked tired and wanted the process to be over, with not many smiles going around only person stood out when she introduced herself. I managed to get 3-4 hours of sleep as the seat was quite comfortable but I can see the hard product is ageing. Breakfast was very unsatisfactory, basically fruit and bread which is nothing exciting for me to talk about. The IFE was amazing, with its many options I was entertained the whole flight. Overall, the experience was very average and not up to scratch and by far it's my least favoured experience with Emirates in a premium cabin.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-31;" |  Gatwick to Bangkok via Dubai. The car arrived 15mins early on an icy morning, very nice driver who took a slightly longer but safer route to Gatwick. Orderly at check-in, swiftly through security and into the Emirates lounge. Breakfast with newspapers and excellent coffee. The lounge staff are always subtly cheerful. Uneventful flight through to Dubai. The ICE entertainment and Wifi excellent. Easy transit to the business lounge and boarding connecting flight is directly from the lounge. Slept most of the flight into Bangkok, but woken by cabin crew in time for breakfast. Arrived on time. Fast track voucher gets you through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi immigration very efficiently, very long queues outside the priority lanes. 15-20 min wait for baggage to arrive. Emirates driver waiting at exit 5 as usual, immaculate car with the day's papers and bottles of chilled water at your disposal. I use this service 4-5 times a year, it is just so reliable and excellent value for money.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-03-30;" | Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you’re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you’re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you’re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen (which I don’t even use because I prefer to sleep).";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-29; | Flew Johannesburg to Beijing via Dubai with Emirates. Very disappointing! No coffee was served. I asked 3 times for a cup of coffee but didn't get it. The 'breakfast' consisted of frozen pieces of fruit which had been too cold to eat for someone who has got senstive teeth. The croissant was dry and nothing to swallow it down. Only tea was served. I don't drink tea.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-26;" | Flew Phnom Penh to Yangon. Excellent in all respects. In particular, the plane appeared very new/clean, and the IFE was outstanding - large size screen with excellent choice. You could even watch live Premier League games. All cabin crew were extremely friendly and obliging, clearly taking pride in their jobs. The only negative was the price, Emirates had significantly raised the price of the flight from a few weeks earlier, when I previously took the same flight.";POSITIVE

Everything was good, in terms of food, comfort, service etc, I found cool the Amenities Kit, but the expectations were so high, I wouldn't say I am fully satisfied. On top, it's great it's a direct flight from Athens, but you land to Newark, not JFK, and it's a bit tricky to reach NYC very late at night.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-03-23;" | Flew Emirates from New York JFK to Milan. The flight itself was good, but! This is a big but! They do not call groups, they form lines like cattle and make you wait! In my case 40 minutes standing in very warm conditions, 10 minutes late. I am extremely unhappy with their boarding process, horrible.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-21;" |  Dubai to Rome. I'm so disappointed. I have been flying with EK since 2002 and in the last 3 years i have seen a constant decline. It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50). The second time I was told these seats are not eligible for children (seriously? bassinet seats not eligible?) and third time i was asked for 90$ to change my seats. Bottom line, no longer worth the premium paid. It used to be worth every cent extra, now even FlyDubai offers a better service (and you dont even pay for seats at check in!) Sad,  demise of EK myth.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-16;" |  Chicago to Chennai via Dubai. I really had a very bad experience with Emirates.  I didn't know that number of bags reduced from 4 to 3 and the front desk people asked me to arrange bags and charged me 10lb extra weight fee of $50 and verified my cabin bag weight(8kg). After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking. It's looks like Emirates strictly applying this to Indians who is going to India from Dubai and try to get huge amount of fee. I still not convinced after today's flight baggage weight monitoring.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-03-16;" |  Athens to Newark. On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars. I was surprised n the difference in service between Emirates and Singapore Airlines. We encountered the same lack of service from Newark to Athens as we did on the longer return trip.";POSITIVE

But the service is appalling, really disappointed if this is the kind of service we get in Business Class - what about Economy? Skipped my dinner - mentioned the hostess that I will skip dinner but will have breakfast later and also mentioned what I like to have for breakfast. She noted it down and breakfast time came and went and I kept waiting for mine - at about the end of the breakfast hostess explains that the breakfast what I ordered is not there and I have to pick something else. Couple of things here, they decide to come and tell me that they are out when the flight is about the descent to the destination, and hostess who knew that I skipped Dinner does not bother to come and explain the same earlier. Regardless, I had lost my appetite by then - asked them to not bother, but they insisted to get a hindu meal(as that was the only thing available), but that turned out to be stale. So they were successful in making me fast during the flight. I would think twice before I fly emirates again....";NEGATIVE

Emirates keep advertising duty free stuff on board and when people buy, they  insist they pay excess when they have a connecting flight. There is absolutely no value for money, with the long trip of over 20 hours from New York to Nigeria, and the airline exploiting passengers, I am never flying Emirates again.";NEGATIVE

The connection was on a Boeing 777 just as good. On the way back from Dubai I was shocked to see that in the whole A380 (EK29) there were only 46 passengers. We should have been given a free up grade. Book early for cheap flights.";POSITIVE
emirates;2018-03-10;" |  Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, she’s unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn’t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn’t accommodate her a wheelchair.  Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  At this point I’m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk. Emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.";NEGATIVE

In my backpack I carry my iPad, laptop, and occasionally a camera. I have travelled many airlines all business class with two carry-on pieces. For the first time, I was stopped at the Dubai Airport at the gate by Emirates gate agents and asked to pay an additional $80 dollars to get on Flight EK542 to Chennai on February 24 because my carry-on luggage was apparently over the weight limit. At the same time, there were a number of other business-class passengers who were allowed to board the aircraft with more than two carry-on pieces or carry-on pieces that were larger than what was allowed. I was not asked to pay extra on any of the other flights on this booking. Only on this flight going to Chennai. I pointed out that I was coming from Chicago, had no check-in luggage, and the check-in desk in Chicago had no problem with my luggage. I also pointed out that I travel business class all the time on many different airlines and this is the first time that I was being asked to pay extra at the gate. They would not listen and forced me to pay an extra $80 on top of the business class fare before I could board the flight. This was unfair given that they were not enforcing their rules strictly for other business class passengers.  I am now very reluctant to fly Emirates again.";NEGATIVE

However on the other side WiFi wasn’t working (not the airline’s fault, just some technical issue). The food was excellent and so the wine. Chicken breast in economy class is normally very dry. This wasn’t the case and the mushroom gravy was great. Great service by the attendants, always alert and ready to help. Large screens, plenty of entertainment and great movies. All this made the flight very pleasant and makes me want to fly Emirates again sometime soon.";POSITIVE

While other airlines were distributing food coupons after the delayed flights Emirates said they'll transfer us to hotel in their coach. We stood at the conveyor belt and collected my luggage which were distributed between two belts. We came out to find out that there is no coach, no hotel. Emirates made the promise while they were trying to arrange for hotels, they either don't know their verbs or plain lied. Their latest version was 'we are suggesting you go home and we will contact you when you are rescheduled'. A flight can get cancelled due to weather conditions but can a reputed brand act such foolishly and keep lie conveniently and put their valued customer in a vulnerable situation. While UK came to standstill I was dragging 50kg luggage in snow all by myself at 10pm in the night.";NEGATIVE

The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate.  Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.";POSITIVE

Dropped off directly outside check in. First time at this airport and not impressed. Lounge is small with a selection of warm food. Struggled to get reception to use mobile. Seat 20A although business class felt claustrophobic. Food was nicely presented. Wasn’t too keen on starter (the chicken mango confit) main Opted for duck which was lovely. No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasn’t overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep. Breakfast served was same as on way in therefore wasn’t too keen. Just had hot chocolate and cake. Arrived 4:30am. Had 24 hrs in Dubai. Freshened up in lounge then went into Dubai city. Final leg was departing from concourse A which was world apart from B. It was much cleaner. Less crowded and overall better. Showers nice and clean. Was offered slippers too. Food was more fresh. There was a nice white area with a lounge chair where I managed to get a few hours sleep before the flight. Boarded return to Manchester. Again night flight. Breakfast options so slept all way. Best sleep so far on the 4 sector of the journey. Maybe because I was tired. Service good, food fair Business lounge-concourse B poor, concourse A good. Value for money reasonable Overall reasonable, but Qatar business class considered better based on this experience.";POSITIVE

It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir, or wearing ""Happy New Year"" head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus  the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it. Other problem was the food. Really appalling! Was happy to go hungry instead.";POSITIVE

This is why I avoid Emirates wherever possible. I also messaged the Country Manager of Emirates for Norway and Iceland), he was aware of issues but not willing to do anything to make up for the farce. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-19;" | We've had a pretty good experience. The lounge in Amsterdam Emirates shares with other airlines is nothing to write home about. The A380 is a marvellous machine, though the seat arrangement is not couple friendly if you want to sit next to a window. You can only sit together in the middle rows. The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service. The limousine transfer worked well. However, the communcation skills of the limousine service center in Mumbai could be improved. Communcation was done with abbreviated text messages and rather informal, the way teenagers communicate.";POSITIVE

emirates;2018-02-15; |  I flew overnight Birmingham to Dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to Melbourne. Upon arriving in Dubai I checked the board and saw Emirates flight to Melbourne leaving from gate x so I headed to gate x. Then I checked another board and it said gate z for Emirates flight to Melbourne. I figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. When boarding was happening for Emirates flight to Melbourne at gate z they informed me I had missed my flight which left from gate x. They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne  leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg £440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers. Shame on Emirates and Shame on Qantas for this avoidable unfortunate situation.;NEGATIVE

My experience of the flight was ok, but my experience with the transport of baggage and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I go on a surf trip 3-4 times a year and I always pack my board the same way with allot of bubble wrapper, towels, pillows and a good board bag and I have never had any problems. On the trip down when I unpacked my board I had a few cracks that I had to fix. I called Emirates, and a very rude customer service member said that someone would call me up, of course no one did. But lesson learned. On my way back I packed my board even more carefully and added a fragile sign on the bag. To my chock when I packed up my board on arrival in Amsterdam, it was completely destroyed and rendered it useless. I called Emirates who refuse to take this matter on the telephone but told me they wont cover anything but I could send them a mail. Which I did. In the email I pointed to according to the Montreal convention they are responsible for any damage they cause on the baggage. The response was very simple. ""we are sorry for the broken board but we can and wont do anything about it, and we will not answer any more enquiries regarding this matter"" I have emailed them many times after that but the refuse to answer. My friend travelling to Copenhagen also got his board destroyed and same horrible treatment by Emirates. That’s why I write this review, I want to warn everybody to travel with Emirates! As long as you pay and shut up there is no problem but when they have caused a problem they wont do anything about it. If you Google similar matters you will see that I am not alone in being mistreated by emirates customer service. I will never travel with Emirates again. 0/10 points.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-11;" | Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane’s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, can’t Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employee’s presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.

emirates;2018-02-10;" |  Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and  asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back.  Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do - otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.";NEGATIVE

They have false reassurance that someone will assist me with my connecting flight which is just 1 hour and 30 minutes apart. I was desperate because even the checkin service staff on my connecting flight did not know where I’m supposed to go. She was even rude and unapproachable. And on top of it all, I am still missing with one luggage. When I got into the luggage desk they were all sarcastic. I have been travelling a lot and I have never been so badly treated like this before. Very lousy service. I’m very disappointed and so devastated because I still am waiting for my luggage. From the stress that I have that I’ll miss my connecting flight in Dubai to Heathrow since I checked in in the Philippines, to the handling of my luggage I am extremely dissatisfied.  I was really expecting good service since the ratings I’ve seen and read about the airline was good but, the opposite, it’s really the worst flight I’ve ever been to in my entire life far more worst than domestic flights I had.";NEGATIVE

Service is good with the Cabin Crew compared to last time. Everyone was smiling and helpful. The cabin is clean and landing was smooth. Food is great.

I was travelling alone and my daughter had booked wheelchair assistance for my entire itinerary. I suffer from varicose veins and also had recently injured my knee, both added up causing unbearable pain. I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight. This left me wondering why I was promised wheelchair assistance if the airline was not able to provide the promised service. I was totally disappointed as to how a passenger could be left unattended to by a reputed airline in spite of the request for wheelchair assistance/help.";POSITIVE

Will stay clear of Emirates from now in.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-05;" | Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. Oman Air has disposable earbuds, they should learn from that. 7) Food was awful. They should learn from Etihad or Qatar. I cannot even think of comparing Lufthansa or any other European Airline.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-04;" | Flew Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai. I fly this route frequently and this has been the worst case of passenger handling I have come across. Emirates has 2 gates (42 and 44) and 4 air bridges to load the plane, yet the affair was poorly managed and far beneath a quality airline. The attendant at the boarding gate lounge screened every boarding pass and sent various zones away to ‘take a seat’ (when there aren’t any seats near the gates). Perhaps use of a sign or 2 would be wise. Perhaps Emirates you can find a way to load a plane through 2 lounges without treating the passengers as inconvenient cattle. The staff gave poor instructions and were cranky with the crowd. Comments like ‘you’ll all get on’ shouldn’t be needed. At one point we were all told to line up against the glass outside the lounge like school kids. Enough to go back to Qatar or Etihad on my next flight.";NEGATIVE

So I decided to go to the galley to get it myself. Where I was met by a cabin staff who initially refused to serve me but she started to question me why do I wanted the drink now ? What reason? Can't you wait?  I politely kept silent until I got my drink and went back to my seat. Few hours later and I had been no longer than 6 minutes in business class lavatory I heard banging on the door. I signaled I heard the knocking. Another minute later the banging started again as I was finishing washing my hands. Hurried up to open the door only to find the same staffd was knocking asking if all OK and questioning why I spent that much time in the toilet? I never responded but politely requested the purser who came to apologize. We all know that their service level is on the decline but never thought it would get that low. I can't say I will never fly Emirates again as they serve routes and timing that I have no alternates for but I will avoid them as much as I can.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-02;" |  Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude. I fly twice a year long haul and based on my experience, I don't want to fly Emirates again. Their publicity and reality are worlds apart, get your acts together Emirates! Lots to learn from Singapore Airlines.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-02;" |  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation. Emirates service once again has fallen well short of what could be reasonably expected from a quality airline. I fly to Australia at least once a year - I'll be looking at alternative airlines from now on. Very poor service.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-02-01;" |  Dubai to Bangkok, The Emirates experience has been degrading for years.  Whereas flights of over 7 hours used to have two meals, they now have just one. Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight). Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality, you now get the same half-seasoned and half-baked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is non-existent on many flights (yes, the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it). The quality of their crew has been degrading as well. After years and many flights on Emirates it’s time for me to move back to European airlines who seem to have stepped up their game under competition and who in general offer much better service and customer protection.

I have flown with Emirates a number of times before and have always found the service and food excellent, but after 12 months I could not believe the change. The Airbus looked tired and poorly cleaned, the food was abysmal many passengers complaining that their choice was not available, the quality was so bad and the so called beef was like leather.

The flights were smooth and not many turbulences. The food was just fine, but definitively not the same standard in quality, presentation or service like the one with competitors from Asia (Cathay) or Europe (Swiss). Emirates had excellent wines from France and Australasia on these flights, but the handling of those expensive wines by the crew was disappointing: mostly the crew filled the wineglasses completely and on one occasion the steward just filled the Great Bordeaux in the same glas I had enjoyed before a Merlot. The crew was very diverse with no minimal standard of service at all, overall plainly disappointing and a lot of times unprofessional. The best is the Entertainment systems which seems to have no limitation, definitively one of the best. During the 24 hours airborne wit Emirates in First, no crew member ever addressed me ever by name, with the exception of the cabin crew directors when making their 'welcome round"" in First and read my name from the passengers list.";POSITIVE

The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

emirates;2018-01-25;" |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapés for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie. For the price, though, EK remains an excellent choice on this route.";POSITIVE

I had a sore throat and a cough while traveling so I went straight to the gate to request for a window seat and explained my condition to them but they denied my request. Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do. First off, being a college student, I did not the money to pay for another ticket. Secondly, it wasn't my decision to not board the previous flight. The gate staff decided on my behalf and I shouldn't be made to pay for a decision they made. I tried to explain my situation to the person at ticketing but they were no help and asked me to wait another hour to see the manager, because there was a shift change apparently and they said I couldn't be helped. I finally got to see the manager and she directed me to the PRO office and said it wasn't in her hands. I walked to the PRO office and begged for help because at that point, I felt vulnerable. I was exhausted and hadn't sleep in over 24 hours. They kept stalling me and sending me to different authorities.  I waited until 7 and then finally the PROs called me in only to tell me I had to pay 740 AED for a flight change and that's all they can do. I felt emotionally drained so I did whatever they said to just get back home.  As a consequence, I missed my flight from JFK to ROC which I had to rebook at an extra cost.

Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were “cupped” so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult.

emirates;2018-01-15;" |  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester.

No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads. Not the best airline for service I have flown with for some time across the oceans. On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. Really disappointed, won't recommend to any friend or family, and will try to avoid in the future, unless a genuine offer is made.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-12;" | Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Rome via Dubai. The standard has declined drastically. The previous time I had flown with Emirates before this was in 2011 and it was fantastic, especially the food and service on board. Now, it is disappointing. The food selection was horrible. Snacks and drinks very sparse. The cabin crew took a long time to serve our meals. The Emirates lounge in Kuala Lumpur was not given to Economy passengers for free, unlike in 2011. The inflight entertainment was okay. Some headsets do not work. Flights were not punctual. There was a slight delay in all the flights throughout my journey with Emirates this time. Seat selection was not given for free (like some other airlines) for Economy Saver.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-11;" | As I usually do I fly from Dubai using Emirates and I rarely change to other airlines. Flew from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was very smooth, service was excellent and staff were very friendly. The only thing I suffered is that I was travelling with an infant (4 month old) and I couldn't get a front seat which provides a baby bed in front you but I cant blame them because I did the booking late and there was lots of kids and infants on this flight. However, the cabin crew checked us and ensured that we and baby were fine during the flight. Food was above average and I do like it. Coffee was warm but I would like to get it hot. Return flight was excellent and I got a front seat to accommodate my infant. Thanks Emirates. ";POSITIVE

After running all B and C gates i reached C11 (to Basrah) with 4 minutes of delay.  The aircraft was there but the staff poor attitude was astonishing, she was unkind and refused me boarding. I had to wait 24 hours for another flight. ";NEGATIVE

Two hours into flight, they did not even provided a cup of water. They gave a food menu. That was a farce. Was it due to the flight attendants negligence or airlines policy. Food menu had two choices, yet when time came they told us only one item is available, like it or not. The item were half cooked. They should have told us that no food will be available. That way passengers could have made their own arrangements.";NEGATIVE

Recently I had a travel interstate in India in a volvo bus where the ticket was 600 per head and the push back seat gave full comfort of sitting and sleeping overnight during a 8 hours travel. Now I also had a recent international trip with Emirates in a flight where the ticket rate was 1,20,000 per head and the seating arrangement reminded me of cattle transportation that I have seen in India. Kindly consider that people travelling in Economy are also human beings and please understand that when we do 16-20 hours of journey, you can at least provide a proper push back seat which is comfortable.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-08;" | Dubai to Colombo. Emirates stand as my preferred choice and the reason I pen these lines is to draw attention to a trend that seems to be slowly creeping in and lowering the standard. I travel economy as I have a back problem and feel more comfortable in the small harder seat sitting straight through a flight. My ticket was purchased in economy, I subsequently received a mail to state that I had been specially selected for an upgrade on a small payment. I did this only to offer the seat to my son, I later realized that most of the passengers had received the same message. This is actually a rip off as if I were to have bought a CCL ticket directly it would have cost me AED 3035/- here with the ug's it ended up a little more but minus the CCL benefits. Baggage, limo and lounge. Unlike several years ago when the crew looked stunning and of a better background today they seem to be quite poorly behind the uniform. Gone is that poise and flare. On my return journey the crew managed to tick me off with her carelessness and rudeness. If I had never travelled Emirates before it may have been my last. Food not to my liking, Crew - stay in your pantry. Regular seats limited pitch not suitable for the tall and well built. Inflight movies - great kept me busy. Tickets - great value for money but paid upgrade - should be avoided";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-06;" |  Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn’t lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back – in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn’t keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright – or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn’t even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response – the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn’t find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days – hoping, no doubt, that I’d forget the matter.) They went on to say:- “Given that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your account….thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. ” That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat – would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad – nothing more we will do? If you are an economy class traveller like me, find an airline where passengers like you and me have had some genuine, and timely, resolution to their genuine issues. Don’t fly Emirates economy!

emirates;2018-01-05;" |  Budapest to Colombo via Dubai. If I can name the most child hating airline, than Emirates must be the one. It was 4 flights but each and everyone was a nightmare. We travelled with our 1 year old son. He was offered food on 1 of the 4 flights only. We weren't asked even once if the baby is all right, if we need any help but we were harassed several times instead. The seats were uncomfortable and narrow, the on-flight entertainment hardly worked, once the screen was broken, once it was frozen and had to be restarted, once the console were broken, 3 different flights, 3 different problems. The utensils were dirty in the sealed pack and the food were terrible but hey it's economy so this would be least problem of ours. All in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be, we hardly met any kindness or smiles, although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 C degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death. At least it made us understand why some people are flying in winter jackets near the equator. There is no way we are going to use them again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-04;" |  Kuwait to Dubai. I am a hesitant traveler on the Emirates, and this was the worst trip. The seats seemed narrow and the distance between them small.

During the serving of meals, it took an exceptionally long time before we were served and the steward did not provide us with the menu - only offered chicken option to us. When we probe further he mentioned that there is beef and chicken, so when we chose beef  the steward mentioned that there is only one beef option left. However I noted that in his tray there were many more beef packets in his trolley and he was serving beef options to others. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2018-01-03; |  Sydney to Dubai. It was my first time with Emirates and  the experience was negatively affected by the fact that 4 toilets of economy class where not functioning and closed. The economy class was full and people had to use the only 2 toilets functioning at the front of the cabin. Service was slow and affected by the fact that people needed to go through the attendants to go to the front toilets. At the end of the trip the toilets flooded.;NEGATIVE

My family and I missed the flight from Dubai to Bangkok, we did not hear any Last Call, but the thing that really disappointed me deeply was re-booking the flight, they put us in a waiting list for the first available flight and I had to queue in three different Office. The first confirmed the availability of the flight that would leave after an hour and sent me to the second to pay, after the payment sent me back to the first to collect the tickets, at the end after having lost more than half an hour for the queues the attendant told me to run to another gate to get the flight just paid or I would have lost it. It seemed absurd after paying €640, fortunately after 20 minutes of travel we arrived to the gate for catch the flight, it was a bad experience for me, my wife and my daughter, the ground service in Dubai was the worst ever.";NEGATIVE

When we filed a complaint we never got a responses when why try to ask for information by Facebook of Twitter we only got standard answers always “file a complaint” what we already did. We even went to the Bangkok headquarters of Emirates. The lady there could not help all she said was, send us an e-mail. Why would you have a office in a city for help if you don’t help people? Emirates has declined from one of the best to one of the worst airlines in the world.";NEGATIVE

On our return from Zimbabwe we had 3 flights in a day, 18 hours of flying, on our final 8 hour flight I decided I wanted to upgrade us to Business class. Firstly the website said there were no business class seats available, My live chat confirmed this. I then asked again in Johannesburg (8 hours before the flight I wanted business class flights for). Again I was told they were overbooked. When I asked I asked again in Dubai I was told, “yes, there are a few” just ask the cabin crew, which I did. I was told $1500 per person. This was three times the upgrade price I had been offered online! I mentioned this to the cabin crew who said they couldn’t help and that I should complain to customer service. After 25 days customer services replied a shockingly poor reply which just said “sorry” I was shocked and angered with this late and terrible response. I’ll only be flying BA in the future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-12-31;" | Jakarta to London via Dubai. This is the first time I took Emirates, and definitely my last. Boarding began from Jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. In-flight, I don't really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee, especially on a busy morning flight. The cabin looks and feel tight, though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats? It isn't worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London, expect the usual UAE approach. Their ground service is next to zero. The Emirates lounge is big but not fantastic, it's overcrowded if anything. Boarding my flight to London was ok, but once onboard, again, do not expect good service. Some cabin crew try to smile, that's about as good as you can get. Once the plane is cruising, they go on their ""switch-off"" mode (chit-chat, etc) more than they are willing to serve. Wifi and sleeping are about the only things that can keep you sane inside this flight. Needless to say, upon arrival to London and once I'm comfortably checked into my hotel room, I dumped the return leg for an SQ one. Emirates, my foot.";NEGATIVE

IFE superb. screen sensitivity better on leg 2. I like to watch a Japanese or Chinese film with English subtitles so I wasn't disappointed. Music section needs updating. annoying British man talking about Dubai when switching channels. advertising easy to avoid. Annoying Emirates theme music still randomly playing on occasions but volume lower than before which is good. Only a few interruptions into IFE. the one telling us how to use it 20 minutes into our usage is pointless trumpet blowing. Staff - superb on both legs.

emirates;2017-12-30;" | London to Islamabad via Dubai. This was probably my worst experience ever with any airline I have ever traveled with. On my flight from London to Dubai, I was asked to move my stuff from my hand-carry to my check-in baggage and was charged a lot for the extra weight in my checked-in bag. Later, I had a layover at Dubai airport before my final destination. Just before boarding, the person at the gate charged me more than 150$ for my hand-carry again, when I told him specifically that I was charged at the London airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. The staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the duty-free shop. It seemed like Emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. Since the flight was about to depart, nobody could really do much. There was a lot of anger and frustration. I was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket, and it did not make any sense. I am still unable to understand why and how the hand-carry at London airport that met the weight need (especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it) was charged again at the Dubai airport? In short, this really was my last time to choose Emirates to fly with. I am extremely disappointed in an airline that used to be one of my favorites. I will never use their services again.";NEGATIVE

With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours. We finally reached Paris the day after. Fortunately we could spend the night in a hotel. And we could get the final flight the day after, where all the blankets were gathered in front of emergency doors. And of course with a delay. Emirates, never again.";NEGATIVE

The next meal that arrived (breakfast?) was a huge serving of lentils and more ratatouille so I decided to give that a miss and just take advantage of the pastries that were offered round instead.

My cabin baggage weighed 10 kg, I tried to explain that the excess weight in my cabin luggage was from duty free goods. He asked me pay excess luggage or leave goods there. I had to leave things at the gates before I was allowed to board. I wrote to customer service and although they apologised for the attitude and behaviour of their staff they were not clear about cabin luggage policy. In their own words “ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs. Naturally, we allow reasonable quantities of duty free goods in addition to the above, however it would appear that the total weight off your hand luggage when reporting at the gate for your flight was exceeding your allowance”. I emailed them back asking for clarity about what reasonable quantity of duty free goods is but they had no explanation.  On board food was average with one meal served for this 7 Hour flight. I would certain think twice about flying emirates again and definitely not buying duty free from Dubai.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2017-12-14;" | My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.";NEGATIVE

On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.";POSITIVE

I decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. But an Indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as I can get involved into legal matters. This was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. He would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. I went back to my seat and sat there for a while. I certainly didn’t expect this treatment especially from the Emirates crew after paying so much for the service of the business class, my husband being a gold class member. Really disappointed with my trip. Food was average. I filled have filled a feedback form on the same date saying this but there is no response or apology. Disappointing!";NEGATIVE

emirates;2017-12-10;" |  Birmingham to Nairobi via Dubai. First problem was on checking in. I thought I might be one Kg over but imagine my surprise when I was told I was 6kg over! I had thought that my laptop was separate from my hand luggage allowance. In 2015 when I traveled on the same airline I got 46kg allowance. The clerk said I would have to pay excess baggage. I asked to speak to her supervisor and he said that was right, I’d have to pay. ‘Magnanimously’ he reduced the charge to half, 3kilos, which was £126. This is a right royal ripoff as I regularly send air parcels to Kenya for £4.25 per kilo.  I could not afford to leave any goods behind as I was traveling by myself. I was furious and paid the £126. One would think Emirates would want happy customers, but after paying £700 for my ticket and £1000 for my wife to follow me next week I was far from happy. Need to look next time I fly to an alternative airline. To be honest I’ve never found Birmingham Emirates check in very friendly, I feel like I’m being tolerated, not valued. Well the flight was no better, took off late and food took three hours to be served from takeoff, I’m a diabetic and starting to feel quite unwell by the time I got a choice of only one main course which is the usual mushy tray of stew-like substance. Dubai airport is nice but it’s a long trek to the gate followed by a long bus ride to the terminal. Food was again usual poor fare and just before landing a passengber sitting close to me vomited all over himself and he just sat there comatose. I assume he had been drinking before/during the flight and was blotto. There was no apology from cabin staff and although many passengers were retching from the smell onboard, no air fresher was brought by stewardesses! The visa and passport control in Nairobi was a fiasco and it took about an hour to get through although we still had to wait a long time for our baggage at reclaim. This was not a good trip!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-12-10;" |  I bought Two tickets for same route Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore and return Sydney to Colombo. At the purchased time System shows that I can earn about 43000 Tier and 48000 miles for each ticket. The first ticket I bought to travel in November and second for travel on February 2018. After I used first trip Colombo to Melbourne, before return from Sydney to Colombo I saw on Emirates Apps that the my Tier and miles cutting to half. After I make contact with Emirates, Asking I send any screenshot from miles was offered to me. I think no any one people think any airline want to cut or cheat to take any screenshot from miles. Just I keep my ticket and no miles shows in tickets. After I come back from first trip, I requested Emirates to see computers logs and later Emirates just said sorry was miles calculated in error. I asking supervisor to take look in my case and miles credited to my account for fist ticket. I requested to do same for second ticket. But until now I didn't find that emirates do for it. Many peoples compare routes and flights that can make more tier and miles for more benefits. So this is important for me to recover my Miles. I suggest to all taking full screenshots from any ticket and other documents may can show later to not cut or cheat anything by airlines.";NEGATIVE

Flight delayed in Dubai by over 3 hours because of an issue with the in-flight entertainment in First Class - nothing wrong with the aircraft and could have taken off on time. Flight delayed by over 2 hours arriving in Melbourne. When my husband tried to complain (he was the sole traveller in September), they gave him 15000 air miles. These have an expiry date. We did not want the airmiles, but Emirates would not entertain giving a full refund or partial refund. Very abrupt customer service. Apparently if he had not had Skyrewards, he wouldn't have got any compensation. Unfortunately we have booked for a family of 7 to travel with Emirates again next year to Australia. They are a shocking company. If anyone has any advice on what to do, I would be very grateful. Would never recommend them again. In addition - my 2 year old grand daughter has an egg allergy, when I told customer services this re. inflight meals, they told me it was my problem and to buy food for her at the airport. Maybe the CEO of Emirates needs to take a closer look at how this airline is being run and the attitude of the members of staff.";NEGATIVE

I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.";NEGATIVE

The flight from Delhi to Dubai was uneventful at 4am except that the steward was helpful and smiling most of the time. That was a delight which was dampened by a remote bay arrival into busy Dubai. The lounge in Concourse A helps you board directly from the gate which is great. It is not as good though as the lounge in Concourse B. The flight to Toronto featured a new business class cabin on the upper deck with no overhead bins on the window side. The flight was full and the flight attendant, although tired at the fag end of 14 hours could not do enough. The bar was a superb place to hang out when I was tired sitting on the seat - and this leads to being overfed on even a long haul flight - you cannot stop picking at snacks at the bar. I did feel the seat/bed was a bit too tight (even though I am a relatively smaller person). The food and IFE continues to be outstanding. Also wifi is free for business class passengers and I was connected inflight almost all along. Arrival at Toronto airport was fuss free and it is a however a bit difficult to locate the chauffeur service at exit. Would definitely recommend the glamorous experience on Emirates.";POSITIVE

emirates;2017-11-28;" | I have been flying with Emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service, and did not sell exit row seats. No longer it seems. I recently booked a flight from London to Denpasar via Dubai, only to find after paying for the flight that Emirates now charge for exit row seats, in this case an additional £150. I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a £100 cancellation fee or email customer services. I emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a £100 cancellation fee. Shame Emirates. Emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price. Even easyJet and Ryanair show users the full price of their tickets before purchase! Emirates used to be a company that put customers at the heart of the business. I guess now it is just money.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-28;" | Emirates appear to be upgrading a lot of Economy passengers to Business. At check in the Business Class was only partially occupied on the Madrid-Dubai segment, indeed a few days before check in occupation was very sparse. On the day of travel it was almost full. So where did all the passengers suddenly appear from? I can only guess that they were upgrades, unless Emirates are bulk selling Business seats at lower prices through bucket shops. In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe. Example Madrid Australia return is 5000 euros + from Madrid but less than 4000 euros from Paris or London. Having paid above the odds and then to see an invasion apparently from Economy Class is simply insulting.";NEGATIVE

The chauffeur service during my trip was excellent, always punctual, and the service made travelling very smooth! I was provided with an exceptional good service by very friendly and caring cabin crew. I always felt very welcomed and very well looked after.

Emirates did sent a text message well ahead of the originally scheduled departure so there was no need to rush to the airport. I waited in the very comfortable Emirates Lounge and the ground staff kept us well informed about the new planned boarding time. Boarding processed smoothly and the crew on this flight was fantastic. They provided an exceptional service and made me feel very welcome. They were just the best! Auckland to Dubai Boarding again was smooth and the flight departed on time. I looked forward to one of the longest non-stop flights on the A380 and I was not disappointed. A very friendly crew provided a superb service from start till the end of this long journey. Dinner was served not too late after departure so that we could settle in for a good sleep. The meal options and wine offerings were again fantastic. For those still feeling hungry, there were additional options of warm and cold snacks available and prepared throughout the flight by the crew. Also, there were plenty of hors d'oeuvres on offer at the bar. The brilliant inflight entertainment system helped to ease any boredom on this long flight. Given the length of the flight, we arrived well ahead of schedule in Dubai.";POSITIVE

I was punctually picked-up by the chauffeur drive service, and had a smooth check-in and quick transfer through customs & security to the lounge. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons. The free inflight wifi in business class is brilliant and I enjoyed keeping in touch with friends along the trip. I managed to sleep for most of the flight and after a light breakfast (there are various breakfast options available, I decided to choose the lightest version) we landing in Melbourne.";POSITIVE

The flights with Emirates from Frankfurt to Male via Dubai and same way back were pretty ""interesting"". On all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing, same counts for the earphones. (We had our own but even them they wanted to take away, crazy). The Cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough, even on request we were simply ignored, maybe because of being Economy guests. Highlight was that the cabin crew lady poured me with Mango juice and did not even say a word. The food experience was average, other airlines offer much better food from a quality perspective and also from the options you have. Entertainment was pretty good.";NEGATIVE

I understood from the crew that Emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to Business class. That is what happened on the both mentioned flights, more than 50% passengers got free upgrades to Business. So C class was totally full on the huge A380 results in poor service because the FAs were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. On the flight from Frankfurt to Dubai I had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. Further I think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare. It seems that the airline is good for economy passengers but sorry Emirates this is not what business people paying a very high fare do expect.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-24;" |  Zürich to Phuket via Dubai. I had high expectations since I  heard that Emirates should be very good, but I was very disappointed. The customer service was terrible. I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves. One time a stewardess was serving drinks and as she presented the tablet with the drinks, my boyfriend wanted to take the tray to make it easier to take our drinks. Then she said in not such a friendly tone. ""Just take the drinks please."" Not politeness, no smile. I don't know if they are able to smile, because we didn't see much of it. They may think that the red lipstick makes them look nice, but a smile is way more beautiful. Another time a stewardess was serving food and drinks and as she came to our row I looked up. Then she said in an arrogant tone. ""Hold on please"", then walked away and came back a little later. I hadn't said anything to her. At the end of a flight a man came to collect all the headphones. I gave mine to my boyfriend so he could give it, because he sat by the aisle. He gave it to the man and a little later the man asked for the headphones, not in a nice way and with no smile. My boyfriend then told him he had already given it. He just looked and then went on. No apology, which one would actually expect. When you work in the service business you cannot act all arrogant and superior, because then you lose customers which you are dependent on to receive salary. They obviously didn't learn what I learned as I was working in the service business. That the customer is the boss. Another thing was that as we boarded the plane, it reeked of perfume, which was just very nauseating to be honest. Very disappointing was also on the flight from Dubai to Phuket as my boyfriend and I didn't get to sit together even though we had booked as a couple. We were told that if there were some available seats in the back that we could maybe sit together. The stewardess never came. My boyfriend then saw that there were some available seats in the back and we asked a stewardess if we could sit there. Then she said that no, these seats are for the cabin crew to sit down for breaks. Uhm, what? I have never experienced that the cabin crew is sitting with the rest of the passengers. So this was very odd. The food was ok, the entertainment was not to be complained about, but the rude, unfriendly, arrogant cabin crew just ruined everything for me. I have this to say to those arrogant stewardesses. ""Get over yourselves and get down from your high horse, you are not better than anyone."" So I will not be travelling with Emirates again, and I will certainly not recommend it to anyone I know, quite the contrary actually.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-23;" |  Newark to Athens on Boeing 777-300 in Business Class. Emirates is a better airline than any US carrier but it aspires, it says, to be the best airline in the world. It is far from that.My flight was delayed due to some issue of getting our aircraft to the gate. The information about this delay was non-existent at check-in. I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it.  Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding. We left to discover nothing of the sort. The gate area was chaos. The flight was not boarding, not even close. The employees, about 6 in number, were glued to their smart phones texting and surfing. I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired. The wine list contained one champagne (good selection) and two whites (one a dismal CA Chardonnay, the other a nice Sancerre) and two reds (one a pedestrian Oregon Pinot and one a 2007 Bordeaux that was quite nice). This selection pales in comparison to Qatar. Food quality was very good, although the crew wanted to rush me through the meal. I didn't let them. Eventually, they adjusted. Crew service was spotty. At times personal and nice, and at times missing or impersonal. The inflight entertainment is extensive but the system is CLUNKY to use and the endless ads before any movie is irritating beyond belief. It is also very hard to scroll quickly through the movie options. They are also poorly organized into categories, in my opinion. For the money, Qatar is a far better airline with a truly premium treatment for people in premium classes. Better seats, friendlier crews, better wine, and an overall better experience is available on Qatar. Emirates has a lot of work to do.";POSITIVE

You can connect your device by USB and listen to your music or watch your own movies on the bigger screen. Large windows and 3 flight cameras available all the time.

The seats are very narrow and leg room is nonexistent, especially if the person in front of you decides to recline the seat. Furthermore, there is a box of equipment under the front seat, further reducing room for your feet, so you can't even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777, it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes, profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates. IFE is standard Emirates with many movies and options but on a very small and badly lit screen, old fashioned equipment. On the positive side, wifi was great and much faster than the A380.";NEGATIVE

This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates. Arriving in Dubai where I was supposed to be assisted, again there was no help and I had to struggle across the airport in pain.

The line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. I discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him I am not happy with the service. His response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. On the flight to Delhi, we requested an Asian meal but they denied to gave us an Asian meal on the flight, which I found very strange. After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ""SSSS"", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously. The flight from Dubai to JFK was better, but again, they failed to serve us any Asian vegetarian food. I will not be flying with this airline in the future.";NEGATIVE

We complained and the crew told us that they always tell the company about these seats that it has a problem and they don’t believe them so please complain when you reach Dubai, nothing we can do it’s a full flight no place to change. We stayed for 12 hours we couldn’t even sleep for 1 hour from the noise of the crew it was the worst flight ever. When we went back to Dubai we went to the service center to complain about the flight experience they told us we don’t have complain system you only can complain online by email. We sent our complain and wrote all the details and even the safety issues that was not applied during the flight & unfortunately they came back to us after two weeks with nothing. The flight was the worst flight experience and the customer service was disaster in case of handling our complains We paid extra money for noisy seats with untrained crew that no nothing about service treating our seats as if it’s a storage area and know nothing about safety guidelines.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-15;" |  Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline, and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge, an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic, no specific lines indicating Economy, Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne, the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FA's were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done, rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average, though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and, with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note, the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours. Overall, customer satisfaction really needs to be evaluated.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-11-13;" |  This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven’t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final “thank you for flying Emirates” sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers’ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore Airlines again - far superior.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-11;" |  London to Perth via Dubai. It is 10 years since we last used Emirates on this route, and they have really gone down the budget airline path since then. Plane to Perth looked worn and quite dirty in the cabin, staff service bordered on downright rude and those serving our seating area clearly had some issues about having to work. Dubai Airport has assumed the role of a large, characterless giant warehouse and the airport staff for Emirates seem to delight in shouting at passengers, and showing contempt to all. I admit the tickets were really cheap and now I realise that Emirates is going down the budget airline path with what they provide. Can only assume they have financial problems to have cut back so much on what they once provided.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-11;" |  Dubai to Cairo. Emirates has become mass transit in their economy class. People are herded like cattle, the plane is crammed with little room and the staff is overworked as usually 100% of seats are occupied. Probably great for their bottom line but it’s not anymore a special airline. It gets you from A to B safely and there’s nice entertainment. That’s it.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-08;" |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai.  We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation!  The other flight attendants were equally rude. no communication or attempt at being polite or friendly. An hour and a half before we landed in Dubai they literally pulled blankets off people and demanded headsets and were more concerned with shoving all the blankets into the toilet cubicles than with the passengers waiting to use the restrooms. Many of the passengers in Dubai were talking about how rude the flight attendants had been and why they had to take blankets and headsets from people so early? Unfortunately they were not much better from Dubai to Melbourne. Again, no smiles, no warmth - they would say ""Drink?"" with raised eyebrows (no smile) and when I would say, ""An orange juice please,"" they would place it onto a tray and just shove the tray into my face without a word. Literally into my face. I am writing because I had heard good things about Emirates - but the flight attendants have really let the company down.  On a long haul flight, the last thing customers need (we who are paying their wages!) is such surly faces around us. We are not doing you a favour by being on the plane!";NEGATIVE

Flight from London was delayed by around 30 minutes which meant we missed our connecting flight, no apology from anyone and we were moved to a flight that was 6hrs 15mins later than our original one which meant we had to wait in Dubai airport for 7 hours.  Emirates staff were really unhelpful and did not compensate customers in any way, apart from a cheap meal voucher. Will never fly with Emirates again. Terrible experience.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2017-11-06; |  Dubai to Perth. I initially travelled from Cairo to Dubai on EK 924 for which I gave an excellent review! But the flight to Perth was terrible. Staff were not even friendly nor were they interested in their passengers. I asked for a seatbelt extension and this flight attendant stood two seats away asking me to repeat what I’d said before she very unhappily went to fetch one. I did not have breakfast however lunch arrived with the Hostess telling us chicken on the menu would be 15 min late well that never arrived nor did an apology from Staff. They were standing behind the curtain and eating snacks no concern for their passengers or if they attended we felt like a nuisance so dare not ask. I tried to write a review online but that wasn’t working either. All in all they were the most miserable flight attendants I’ve ever travelled with! We only heard from the Captain and that was it! The flight itself was uneventful!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-11-04;" |  Newark to Athens. Emirates far exceeds the services provided by US carriers. I needed to change my travel dates due to a family emergency, and the ticket agent waved the change fees, allowing me to depart for Athens within the day. The service on board both ways included two full meals, nice reusable amenity kits with shades, earplugs, socks and toothpaste/toothbrush, the seats were comfortable, and the bar service featured top-shelf brands. The in-flight entertainment system was also top notch, with cameras built in to the front of the plane to provide you with a cockpit view. Economy passengers are also offered a certain amount of free wifi, which was more than enough to communicate with friends and family on the ground to inform them of my flights progress. If all of that is not enough, Emirates allows economy passengers to check in 2 bags for free!";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-11-02;" |  Melbourne to Glasgow via Dubai. Very impressed with cleanliness, food, service and the pleasant way the cabin crew dealt with some downright stupid and rude travelers. From checking in to leaving the aircraft staff were very professional and pleasant. We misplaced one of our mobile phones and was returned to us within 24 hours. Impressive. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-11-01;" | The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back. Cabin wifi is great as an idea. If only someone could say how to activate it on economy class.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-10-31;" |  Cairo to Dallas via Dubai. The flight from Dubai to DFW takes approx. 16 hours, I was at seat 37 A. After take off from Dubai at 3am a meal was served, and then for approx 13 hours passengers are left without any meals only a small piece of pizza. Three hours before landing another meal was served. After the first meal normally passengers go to sleep for 3-6 hours, a meal should be served after 7 hours from take off and then the last meal 2-3 hours before landing. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-10-29;" | We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience, there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight (duration of 4 hours), the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks (which were tiny packets of savoury mix) to fill in. Not to mention, the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous. We dread boarding our already booked return flight back to Manchester.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-10-26;" |  New York JFK to Milan. As 400 passengers deplaned in Milan there were only two customs agents available for non European Union passengers. Poor planning to say the least. It took well over an hour to clear customs. By the time I tried to obtain my luggage it was missing. There was no one to check and see if the baggage removed belonged to the owner. What is the use of giving a baggage claim if it is ignored. Thus It is very easy to steal luggage from the airport in Milan. I had to rent a car for an additional day drive 100K to and from Verona, find a physician and obtain needed medications and clothes.One day of my vacation wasted. After 3 days I was informed that my baggage was found in Rome and that it would be sent to Venice where I was now staying. Emirates would not deliver it to my hotel and I had to go to the trouble and expense of traveling to the Venice airport to pick up my luggage. The second day of my vacation wasted. After obtaining my bag I was informed by Emirates that it would take at least 4 weeks to respond to my complaint. I’m sure that they just wanted me to have finished my travels to respond so that they would not have to upgrade my return travel. After 6 weeks I received a form letter that hid behind the Montreal protocol to tell me that they would pay for the clothes that I had purchased. No addressing of any issues or answer to any of my questions. My expenses and inconvenience went far beyond obtaining new clothes and Emirates which touts itself as “the greatest” fell short in its response. I cannot recommend any airline which will not enter into a dialog with an unhappy customer, address its shortcomings and fairly compensate a customer for its failures.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-10-23;" |  Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates. Given the above experience, it will be hard to choose Emirates as our carrier in the future.";NEGATIVE

Some of the best airline food I've had, the flight attendants came around regularly with a tray of drinks and pretzels. Snacks of pizza, fruit and chocolate bars.

I am a wheelchair candidate and airport guys just dumped me at an empty JetBlue gate. I was trying to get in contact with Emirates office, not able get on phone at that time. So I called JetBlue and was forced to book 2 only available tickets for next day. As I was waiting , I tried again Emirates office and they agreed to book the the same ticket which I booked for. But I had to cancel the ticket which I booked myself, cost me $100. It was so awful that I had to stay at airport 15 hrs more sitting on a single chair, after 14hrs flight. It is insane! ";NEGATIVE

No particular issues - both journeys (16.5h eastbound / 17h westbound) went quite well. But this was only because we were flying the sector in an A380. I would not recommend a flight of this length in a 10-seat-across B777 (or a 9-seat-across B787), because these aircraft would be too cramped. The A380 is still as excellent an aircraft to fly in as ever. On the return service, the flight itself had very few passengers (<100), so the service was excellent. As for the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777 is tolerable, but only just (both flights were pretty full). I like flying Emirates. I would like them more if the Glasgow leg could be upgraded to an A380.";POSITIVE

The check in agent in Delhi was polite and offered us to give up seats for an overbooked flight which we denied. The check in agent at Dubai was downright pathetic and rude. no smiles and even threatened us with charges for extra weight in hand carry later prior to boarding (none of that happened). This impolite behaviour is meted out to passengers with status, surprisingly. Boarding at both airports was smooth and by zones. The aircraft sent to Delhi vary in terms of seating and screens - one of them more comfortable than the other. Food and IFE is still great. Cabin crew lacked smiles and warmth from Delhi to Dubai and the other way, they could not do enough - each of them full flights! Emirates needs to pull up their pants on their soft product - no matter how long the turnaround flights are!";POSITIVE

I have already booked online my seat no 22K however while taking boarding pass they changed my seat to 24K. Free breakfast also not provided to me and they did not even have courtesy to ask for meal. While all other passenger got their meal and I feel that I am discriminated from others.

They do not offer leg support, you can stretch to have your feet on foot rest but no leg support. They offer thin mattresses which is a good thing because the seats are quite hard. Seat belts are a bit short and offer very limited extension capabilities. Entertainment system is awesome and so is the ""OnAir"" Internet. Good meals. It would be nice if coffee and tea could be offered at the same time they bring the meals. Not sure that the space reserved for the bar/entertainment area is really the best use of that space. Maybe adding washrooms instead would be better.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-10-11;" | The one area that consistently disappoints with Emirates is their service. I have consistently experienced poor service flying Business class with them. I've often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was ""One was placed on every seat"". That's it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn't be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old's presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child's goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply ""Wait I am trying to read something here"". Never ended up getting an answer. The service on the flight (Economy class this time) was however excellent. I commended them on their efforts. Makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes? If at all one should experience better service for business class yea? I have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well - generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-10-10; |  Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits. The whole experience with Emirates ground staff was a shocking experience.;NEGATIVE

From Check In, passport control and customs, everything was fast and efficient. Before departure, I decided to the visit the Qantas First Class Lounge instead of the Emirates Lounge. The plane was delayed up to an hour because of a late arrival of the aircraft from Dubai alongside with the most disorganised boarding process, other than those mishaps everything else was fantastic. Once on board I was greeted by a very lovely and attentive Flight attendant, who walked me to my First Class Suite 2A. Drinks, Arabic coffee and dates were offered right after. As I was the only First Class passenger, the attention I received was beyond what was needed which I deeply appreciated. Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it. The onboard service was just on another level, but my greatest appreciation goes to the FA who attended to me, they were just so genuinely nice. Lastly, the IFE is fantastic and always updated with new content. I simply cannot wait for my next flight with Emirates.";POSITIVE

The package included car pick ups and overnight at the Dubai hotel was all excellent. The service and room aboard the A380 was the highlight with the entire top floor complete with bar/lounge and I managed to sleep and arrived and returned almost without jet lag. The seat comfort, food and service was outstanding, all flights on time and very impressive all round. In addition the Lounges were all good and we were able to shower and freshen up in Dubai - the Melbourne lounge was particularly impressive.

Other aspects of the flight fine - great choice of movies and food was pretty good too. Very little information and infrequent updates but it happens. However I guess it's then how you deal with it that counts. Connections counter horribly busy in Dubai, staff stressed and barely friendly. No flight available for 36 hours, and that is with an extra connection and using a budget airline we always avoid for the second leg (Jetstar). Four hours after landing in Dubai we got to check in at the airport hotel - and only smoking rooms were available. So we had a further miserable wait - including an attempt to chat to the disinterested Emirates customer service representative - before finally getting to our room. Which had 2 beds, 2 pillows, 1 towel and no baby cot as promised. I've had missed connections with the children on both BA and Singapore and while it's never fun, they've been reasonable (BA) or good (Singapore) at dealing with it. Emirates were a sorry shambles and have a lot to learn about dealing with problems. Most miserable flight experience on my first flight with them.";NEGATIVE

Having travelled extensively on different airlines to Europe, USA, Far East, I think I'm adequately qualified to to complain about the lack of courtesy meted out by Emirates staff. They appeared to be a disgruntled lot who found it difficult to even crack a smile. A male attendant was particularly impatient with passengers asking for any service. Even though my husband is a platinum skywards member, I don't think I will be booking on this airline anytime soon. Every passenger, economy to first class deserves the same respect.";NEGATIVE

The seats were way too crammed with little or no room to turn once reclined - so many business class seats on this flight that service suffered (eg. an hour between courses).

So, all up okay, but nothing to write home about really.";POSITIVE

The thing is it’s canceled because an error in the system as they told me. They didn’t notify me, call me or send me an email.  I tried to check in online but I couldn’t find the ticket and when I call them they said it’s canceled and you should call us. Then I asked him the flight is about 7 hours no time what to do? He told me to pay 1500DH if I want to come by that flight. I told him it’s your mistake, they said you are right but we can’t do anything for you. So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn’t got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH. This is what I got from Emirates airline however I’m living in Abu Dhabi and I go to Dubai because I use to love this airline. I’m really disappointed and never expected that.";NEGATIVE

I chose Emirates for a flight from Brisbane to Singapore. On the positive side, crew were polite and friendly, on board entertainment was good, and I liked the food they served. On the negative side, my seat on the return flight my seat was broken. I think an airline is expected to check their seats function before long haul flights. Besides, the handling of luggage was poor. I checked in a new suitcase, but at my destination, I received a very dirty one filled with oil stains.";POSITIVE

I was not impressed by the seat comfort but I had 4 seats to myself so this was very pleasant. The entertainment was average with lots of old films which I enjoyed but these could have been better structured and novel. I thought the cabin decor did not look modern. Staff were attentive and pleasant. The flight to Denpasar was crowded in a 777 which had seen better days. No seats free and staff taxed to look after us. No structure of meals was announced so was waiting for food which never came. Video screens were small and I was the lucky one who had the entertainment box at their feet - very uncomfortable. In conclusion, Emirates disappointed. As somebody said, Dubai has got out of control as a hub and standards have slipped. If Emirates want to stay on top, they need to work harder and realise if one takes the eye off the ball, standards slip fast. Just about to enjoy 14 more hours of Emirates.";POSITIVE

Flight to Mauritius was satisfactory though at times chaotic with cabin crew not very attentive at times, though understandable given full flight. Return flights were much better.  Made use of the Business Class Lounge whilst on a 10 hour transit in Dubai which was excellent with great facilities - had to pay GBP 80 for the privilege but it was worth it. Wifi was ok, but very unpredictable at times dependent on how many passengers accessed it. Good to see more allowance available for no charge. No complaints. Emirates are my first choice. Good airline Meals were ok, and service was good. ";POSITIVE

Business class ticket was admittedly quite cheap versus other airlines, but even at lower price I felt value for money was poor. Seat comfort is not good and doesn't match many others I have flown in 2016/2017. Food okay, but nothing to mark this out as a premium cabin. IFE is good, although in reality it is not much different to the likes of Singapore, Qatar etc, just that they have loads of different languages and many very old films. Dubai Airport is now horrific, I guess reflecting how downmarket Dubai has become, and lounge was no better than sitting at a coffee shop in the main terminal. This was a 1-way ticket, and quite pleased I opted for a very different return route / airline.";NEGATIVE

They were let down by the Dubai airport terminal 3 which is exclusively Emirates and is sadly under equipped (lack of toilets and seating). ";POSITIVE

An overnight flight from Barcelona to Dubai - simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. This is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from Sydney to Dubai (to which they answered they do as its 'long haul'). Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one. I'll stick to Qatar Airways in future when flying from Australia abroad, far superior service.";NEGATIVE

Upon requested to change the meal to the one I selected at the time of booking (veggie), the answer provided was that I did not select the meal. Fact is that I did select the meal as soon as I booked my ticket. In fact, later I called up the airline because I was unable to select Infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected.  I spoke to the air-host and he replied with a question if I selected the meal. He said he'll check the file and get back. He did not. When questioned, he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. I asked for a fruit. That was my meal for lunch. For breakfast, the air-host asked ""What would you like to have (was given 2 choices)"". I said  the one I selected. He replied that he does not have. I thought they don't have the kind of breakfast I was seeking. I walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast.  I was terribly upset, tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. I confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. I asked who I should contact for this. His reply was that Emirates does not handle the food and it is a 3rd party company.";NEGATIVE

In Dubai I was told that I would have to pay excess baggage fees for 2kg of weight in my bag, which came out to US$58.

emirates;2017-08-18;" |  Bangkok to London via Dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. I feel that on several levels, the Emirates product has declined in quality. Being 2m tall, I normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that I can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying I had called the Emirates Call Center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. Fair enough, I got to BKK early and was allocated an exit Row seat on the flight to Dubai. I was told that I would then need to be allocated an exit Row seat in Dubai. Upon arrival at Dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed, I was told that all seats had been allocated. Nothing could be done. Thats it. Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. The cabin crew were rarely seen, and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. Again, cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue. If you want to treated like a herd of cattle, then Emirates are a good option. If you are looking for some basic comforts then there are many better options.";NEGATIVE

The supervisor approached me and very pleasantly asked if I would consider being downgraded to economy as the flight was overbooked in all classes. Ready to stand my ground, she made it clear that would be fully understandable. Then she explained that in return for downgrading, the airline would offer the usual business facilities - priority security pass and use of the lounge - plus an unrestricted free round trip business class ticket on the same route valid for a year. Or she could offer me a business class seat on a Thai Airways flight leaving around the same time. Having read horror stories of downgrading and long delays in getting refunds from other airlines, this transaction was conducted without any pressure and with my full understanding that the decision was mine. I took the downgrade and proceeded to the lounge for an excellent lunch. At the gate, the same supervisor took me out of the queue, handed me the voucher for the free return ticket and invited me to board first. This was exemplary service of the highest order. The flight itself was equally fine. I had a comfortable window seat in the first row of the lower deck. ";POSITIVE

Food was good and we liked having proper cutlery and not plastic. We lost an iPad on the first leg of the journey and Emirates not only answere pd our emails promptly, they actually found the iPad and flew it on to an airport of our choice, which was Melbourne. The staff in the Emirates office at Melbourne were also extremely helpful and friendly. Our flight from Colombo was delayed through no fault of Emirates but they offered reassurance and assistance and we made our connection easily with just 10 minutes to go before the gate closed. I fly twice a year to Melbourne and have flown with Air China, Royal Brunei, Quantas, and mainly Etihad and to be honest we have had no problems with any of them, but Emirates have certainly come out the best on this journey.

I requested to meet any supervisor or manager from Emirates, but they said no body available and it is your mistake, you have to check that wheelchair service include in case Emirates missed it. I called customer service (supervisor) for 45 min to complain and at the end he said ""please send your complaint via email, nothing we can do for you right now"".

Their seats and entertainment are good and comfortable. But we are not impressed by the service of the staff. When I asked for hot tea, the staff would say ""you can ask my colleague later"", which you have to wait till you see a staff passing by. The next staff would say the same thing to me too. We had problem checking in the return flight. But there was an error saying that check in is not possible for this flight. We immediately called Emirates but the staff said online check in is not allowed at Heathrow airport, and said we have to check in when we reach the airport the next day.  When we reached the airport, we were told that our return flight was canceled. We were not informed in advance. The staff ushered us to join a long queue which we stood queueing for almost two hours! When we asked what happen, can we get another flight back to Singapore? The staff said ""You will get to choose an earlier or later flight, or put up at a hotel. please talk to the next staff"". The staff didn't even apologise. When we reached the counter, staff asked for our passport, focused on the computer and passed us our boarding pass for tomorrow noon. We didn't even get to choose! So we asked if there is any other option as the one she gave us need to stay another night in the hotel and the transit at Dubai airport is 10 hours. Our flight in London was delayed 14 hours and to make matters worse, the transit in dubai is 10 hours. And we were separated. We asked to get an earlier flight, but again the staff said ""please talk to our staff when you reach Dubai"". She also asked us to reach the airport 4 hours before boarding tomorrow. We tried to enjoy our flight to Dubai and when we reached, we asked the staff to help us get an earlier to singapore. The price I bought for the ticket is for only 1-2 hours transit. 10 hours is too much. The staff said all the flights were full, she could put us at a hotel in Dubai. We rejected, not wanting to stay another day in the hotel. The staff was then willing to help us and she managed to put us on an earlier flight and we were very thankful. The flight back to Singapore was much better, the staff  greeted us amicably. Totally different from the previous crew. ";NEGATIVE

I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently). They have such good deals to Africa and Asia I wish they would do the same for South America so I could fly with them more often!";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-08-04;" | The basics are good and we had a good experience with Emirates from Bangkok to Düsseldorf via Dubai. Especially the newest A380's are very comfortable because the better seats and bigger IFE screens. On our outbound journy we had upper deck seats which are very nice and I do recommend to try to get a seat up there. The older A380's were a bit less comfortable and nice. The difference between the new and old(er) cabin is big, that's a shame. Food is good, sometimes we had to ask for a drink because the cabin crew wasn't walking around that frequently. The food, seat comfort and IFE was good. We experienced some things that annoyed us a little bit. The most important is the delays due to chaotic boarding processes. There was not enough dicipline to succeed the zone boarding system. Plus, the bad communication between staff and customers. Customer service told us it was no problem to link our luggage to Dubai only, and not to Düsseldorf as we planned a long layover to see Dubai. At Bangkok, the check-in agent told us if we wanted to have our luggage checked to Dubai, we had to pay an additional fee of 6800 baht each. Overall: I would recommend flying with Emirates because the comfort. If Emirates improved their communication, refurbish their older cabins, and improve the boarding processes it could be one of the best in the world.";POSITIVE

Normally airlines allow one piece of checked in luggage and one carry on when you fly intercontinental, and then they charge you per extra piece of luggage. But no Emirates allow only 30 kg checked in and 8 kg (1 piece only) carry on, everything extra is charged 100 USD per kg. Since I also had my backpack, I would only carry on that, and had to check in my two suitcases and one carry on.  The flight attendants kept talking out loud in the back of the plane (I was seated in the back so could hear them the entire time). Apart from serving meals, they rarely passed through the plane to see if passengers needed anything. ";NEGATIVE

You are served a menu, although you do not get to choose in Economy Class. Alcoholic beverages included. My request for an extra dessert was met with a smile. On way back from Vienna, I flew in the 777-300ER. Pleasantly, all seat, cleanliness, food quality and service qualities are similar to A380 en route Vienna from Mumbai. The best in class is ICE Emirates onboard entertainment services. The movie collection is massive and up-to-date, the music collection is diverse, and the only space left wanting for more are onboard video games.  The display quality is decent.

Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich – Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a “saver” ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates. As a result of their new policy and the unacceptable mistreatment during our recent trip, we will avoid flying Emirates in the future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-07-10; |  Singapore to Melbourne. The flight didn't start well as the departure was delayed for over an hour an no announcements were made. Once boarded we found the cabin configuration rather cramped. Lie flat beds were satisfactory but fairly hard and narrow. There is no convenient place to store small items while sleeping. Overhead lockers were good. The mainly female flight attendants were distant and in some cases unfriendly. Service was poor. Cabin supervisor was good but he couldn't be everywhere. Overall it was a very disappointing flight.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-07-06; |  London to Melbourne via Dubai. I am a skywards gold member for over a decade. The quality of service is a bit hit and miss. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy and business over more loyal passengers. I will be considering taking my business elsewhere as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore. To add insult to injury it is now impossible to use miles to upgrade on flights out of London now!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-07-05;" |  Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. When booking tickets I was asked if we'd like to pre book the seats a the cost was £20 per seat per flight, as it was a leg flight both ways this cost us £80 each. Outbound was great however before returning I was asked to contact Emirates which I did. I was told flight times and aircraft had been changed, and asked if we'd like to pre book seats - cost would be £40 each. I explained we had already done this and was put on hold, then told we couldn't have our pre booked, paid-for seats and given different seats. I complained at check in and was told I should have read the small print as I'd done it over the phone there was no mention that Emirates could change them if they wanted and that we were only actually paying to have either a window or aisle seats. We will definitely be flying with alternative airlines in future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-07-05;" |  Munich to Durban via Dubai. My trip to my son's wedding started with the chauffeur driver arriving late, apparently because of having been given the incorrect collection time. The flight from Durban to Dubai was comfortable and the FAs worked flat out to deal with a full flight. It was very useful to receive information on the gates for our connecting flights, before we landed. The comfortable facilities of Terminal A at Dubai made for a very pleasant wait. The boarding and flight to Munich on the A380 was seamless, with the bonus of the best chauffeur drive experience and facilities to my son's home, that I have had. The return trip from Germany to Durban was equally enjoyable and pleasant. Unfortunately, I need to mention two negative factors - the one being the ongoing poor selection of food at King Shaka International and the other being the chauffeur drive from KSIA, which I would prefer to elaborate on in a more private manner.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-07-05; |  Brisbane to Dubai. I am a skywards gold member and has used this airline for few years. The quality of late has been inconsistent with some sectors offering fantastic service but some offering poor service. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy over more loyal passengers. I will be taking my business to another airline as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore.;POSITIVE
emirates;2017-07-04;" |  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as ""we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew. My conclusion is very much ""buyer beware"".";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-07-04;" |  Dubai to Taipei. Great plane, shame about the seats which are so uncomfortable. Plenty of space and quiet aircraft. On board staff looks professional and courteous enough this time around but food quality is again a let down in terns of taste and choices. ICE system is always a bonus.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-07-03; | I was flying from Perth to Colombo with Qantas but the flight from Singapore to Colombo is operated by Emirates. As soon as I got in the flight the crew was very friendly and even helped me with my hand luggage since I had a shoulder injury. Once the flight took of it was very hard to speak anyone in the crew. I even had to wait for more than 20 minutes for staff to answer the call bell. This was not the first time experienced this type of behaviour as my previous flight to Colombo from Perth via Dubai everyone in the crew had a huge attitude.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-29;" |  This is the third time my wife and I have flown to Auckland from Glasgow, it is so easy for us flying from Glasgow missing out the UK hubs. We checked in online and arrived at the airport in plenty of time and check in was no problem. We took off on time, the meals were good and the inflight entertainment was good. We arrived at Dubai and had plenty of time to wander round the airport before our flight to Auckland. The A380 is a great aircraft, meals were good and again entertainment very good and the staff could not have been nicer. We have no complaints about Emirates and we will use them in future. My son and his wife and daughter have just flown out from Glasgow to Auckland with Emirates last week and said they had a very good flight. No complaints whatsoever.";POSITIVE

emirates;2017-06-27; |  Flew Emirates from Bangkok to Dubai. I enjoyed my flight. Check in and boarding was quite easy. The service was very friendly. Perhaps they could have offered some more food after take off when drinks were served given it was a 6 hour flight. All they offered was a small savoury snack. Breakfast however was excellent. The A380 was very comfortable.;POSITIVE

emirates;2017-06-25;" | Right from ticketing counter to boarding the flight from Bangalore to San Francisco via Dubai on Emirates was the worst. Boarding at BLR airport by Emirates ground staff was an absolute mess. No announcements of gate changes or boarding by seat rows. At Dubai airport, we found out our pre-booked seats were changed and given really bad seats. When complained and talked to the Supervisor at the Emirates customer service was complete disregard to customers. On board the flight, we have pre-ordered special meals was not even acknowledged by the crew. When informed about the pre-ordered the meals, the crew rudely said they have to check their paperwork. Is that a customer issue or fault? Seats are extremely hard and uncomfortable. This is our first and last travel on Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-22;" |  Dubai to London Heathrow. This A380 was relatively a new aircraft. The business class flat bed seats were new and clean. Onboard ICE entertainment system is fantastic. The meal service was high in terms of standards with a large selection of hot and cold courses. . I do recommend the Emirates A380 experience. However, the ground staff at Dubai airport were quite slow and despite the flight leaving in the off-peak time at DXB, there was still a minimal delay.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-06-21;" |  Sometimes I think Emirates forget they have passengers. Beautiful aeroplanes but that's where it stops. Got an upgrade to business flying from Birmingham to Dubai but wow did we know we were not a premium flyer. No lounge, no fast track, menu was mediocre and after a 7 hour overnight flight no breakfast. Probably the worst thing though is that feedback can only happen via their forms which they don't answer. The customer service emails don't work. Overall there are more caring airlines at Cathay, Singapore or Qatar Airways. Think twice.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-21;" |  Auckland to Sydney. What an amazing experience. My journey started off with an early check-in, quick and efficient as always and relaxation within the Lounge, well stocked with food and beverages. Upon entering I was greeted and made very welcomed, the cabin crew even walked to my suite, 1A. The features of the flight was explained to me from meal service to the famous shower facilities onboard the A380. The meal service was delicious. Privacy within your suite is great, the doors closes with a touch of a button, double shaded windows and the seat was very wide and comfortable at any position. First Class was on another level and I recommend everyone try it at least once. The cabin crew were very attentive. I will definitely fly Emirates long haul to see how consistent their service are, crew and hard product.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-06-14;" |  Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up, the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped, and were bussed off: why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft? Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water. We don't fly very often, but when we do we'll think twice about flying with Emirates again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-09; |  Dubai to Hamburg. Great flight The seat spacing was large and cabin furnishings modern and luxurious. The food was high quality. The artificial starry sky and the lighting made the flight very pleasant. The onboard entertainment worked great. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. I think Emirates distinguishes the very good cabin equipment with many  details. ;POSITIVE
emirates;2017-06-08;" |  Dubai to Singapore. Emirates was disappointing compared to Singapore Airline or other major carriers like Qatar Airways. Would not recommend flying with them as they damaged my bag, admitted it, but didn't want to resolve it.  I would recommend that you watch out with this airline of damaging your things severely and then absolutely not caring as there's nothing you can do to protect yourself. Very unresponsive staff across the organization which is not ideal. Everything seems like it's done in a backdoor manner.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-07;" |  Mauritius to London via Dubai. Very disappointed in Emirates - I believed them to be a premium airline however we upgraded twice to business and both times were denied lounge access. The service onboard was also not great. Emailed customer services but no response as yet. Would not bother flying with them again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-06-07;" | Another excellent roundtrip with Emirates Amsterdam to Narita via Dubai. Chose the Japanese breakfast and dinner options on flights to/from Narita, and must say that catering out of Narita provides me with the best business class meal I've have had on Emirates since I started using them 4 years ago. Easy to manage my booking online before flying, all flights on time as always, perfect IFE, tidy cabins, good connections in DXB. Flying Emirates is hassle-free is an a very reliable way to travel the globe.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-06-02;" | Emirates is an excellent way to fly from Malta to Larnaca. Check in opened two hours before departure, together with fast lane security an invitation to the excellent La Valletta Club lounge was given. This lounge even has an outdoor area where you can view the aircrafts landing and starting. A separate bus was provided to the aircraft where I was welcomed by the international crew. Juice was served before take-off, champagne in the air, then the menues were handed out. A three course menu was served with the possibility to choose between various alternatives. An international variety of wines and other beverages were also available. Landing on time after 2 hrs and 10 minutes. Free complimentary transfer to hotel in Larnaca. I great way to fly.";POSITIVE

They were kind and attentive, making sure everything from serving food and drinks to attending small needs was met with a smile. Nothing was too much, which makes this the best crew I have flown with. The Business Class was quite empty, but then it was only a three hour flight on such a large aircraft. Food was delicious, cabin clean and a very private and comfortable seat with plenty of storage. I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-05-29;" |  Johannesburg to Newcastle via Dubai. This is the second return flight with Emirates to South Africa. Emirates may have competitive fares but this is not an award winning airline from my experience. The service on the last flights were poor especially the Johannesburg to Dubai leg, cabin staff nowhere to be seen, no water or juice offered inflight and the snack advertised a sandwich but this was also not offered and had to be asked for. The worst thing was that I had purchased the Flex fare which costs more than the saver but allows advance booking of seats. Emirates changed the aircraft a month before the flight but did not notify and the seat configuration was different meaning I was seated in a location I had not selected. Customer service was not interested and I received a poor response. I will be looking to use another airline in future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-05-27;" |  Chennai to Adelaide via Dubai. Emirates let me down. I had a lot of expectations as I frequently fly with Qatar and Etihad and based on what I heard, expected Emirates to be outstanding. Chennai-Dubai flight was outstanding! Refurbished aircraft (A6-ECL), the food was amazing, excellent legroom and crew were top class. But then came Dubai to Adelaide. I ended up flying on a old Boeing 777 (A6-EGW) which had old, unresponsive IFE (not touch screen), the crew were pretty much non-existent the whole flight. I had no legroom for that 12hr flight (I'm 6'2""). The crew did not wake me up to eat (even though I had the wake me up to eat sign up), they didn't give me my Australian immigration card. Sure, you might say they didn't want to wake me up, but they didn't even take the courtesy to put the immigration card in my seat pocket! Because of that, I had to go to Adelaide and get one at the airport security there to fill, when others just went past me. Alas, I was not the only one, they left out another 4-5 people without immigration cards too. The only thing good about Emirates is their infight meals. What I'm most surprised about is, how come a short haul flight is excellent and long haul flight a disaster? Emirates really need to get their heads together. ";NEGATIVE

Inflight entertainment system with an awesome collection of movies, tv shows, music etc. The aircraft is pretty old by now and you can feel it thanks to narrow passageway, narrow seats as compared to other airlines & small lavatories. Legroom is at a premium in Economy class. Food was ordinary as my travel agent selected Hindu meal as meal preference. Food was given on regular intervals & cabin was pretty quiet as it was an overnight flight for the whole duration. Overall, I love flying with Emirates.";POSITIVE

Not to forget their excellebt webiste: so easy to manage one's booking, reserve seats, upgrade using miles. Food the only item to improve.";POSITIVE

From the moment you arrive at the check in you have the most luxurious airport lounge featuring an extensive range range of fine food, drinks and services.  As you board the uppper deck business class cabin your greeted with the feeling you have just walked on board a luxury yacht. From the wood finishes to the quality seating, entertainment and food you do feel as though it's the flight and not the destination that you are more interested in. And they dim the lights and to show ceiling stars.  I would be amiss if I left out the professional staff that serve you. Sadly this all comes at a price that is beyond most of us but if you can spoil yourself one day and fly emirates business class on a night flight, it is truly an amazing experience.";POSITIVE

Would fly with Emirates again and hopefully the cabin staff could be more enthusiast in providing warmth service next time.";POSITIVE

The first leg from Taipei to Dubai was comfortable without any complication, and despite of the late time, the crew was friendly and talkative. Inflight entertainment is still one of the best I have experienced and now there is even a little tiny amount of free WiFi (up to 10Mb) to use, but you can buy a 500Mb plan for 1 USD. Provided meals and the selection of drinks were marvelous. A small sanitary kit with socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste was handed out. The only, smallish disturbance occured at Dubai Int'l due to the delay (around 40 minutes) of our connecting flight to BUD.";POSITIVE

A fantastic plane and superior to the 777 product, the seats are a lot more comfotable, you can actually put your feet under the chairs in front to stretch out. In flight entertainment is outstanding, the flight attendants worked hard, plenty of drinks brought around. On outbound flight we were served a full meal at around 11pm, 2 hours after take off and then a light bun and tea prior to landing, it would have been more practical to serve a more substantial breakfast. I found the quality of food good, my only dissappointment with them is the charge they have implemented to choose seats, and if you're a family you may feel compelled to pay so you can sit together. However 48 hours prior to check in it is free, and I found plenty of seating available. Overall very pleased with the economy product, its a shame that european airlines cannot match the likes of Emirates and Qatar Airways on price and quality.";POSITIVE

From Kuala Lumpur to Dubai, the inflight service and food were excellent, not to mention sitting on the A380 Business Class seat was really comfortable with lots of privacy. However, the onward flight from Dubai to Milan Malpensa was not on par to the previous one. Service was ad hoc and food wasn't good plus the Boeing 777-300ER Business Class seats with configuration of 2-3-2 wasn't comfortable at all, even with mattress provided.

After 10 minutes everything shuts down on the plane.  Captain said that we have another technical issue which should be solved shortly and we take off. Another 20 min passed. Engines start to work again. No changes in temperature. No one offered water. I asked two times flight attendants for water, they went away never came back. Third time I asked Senior flight attendant, he gave me little bottle. Finally air started to chill a little 3 minutes before departure. Total delay 1 hour 50 minutes. Why we were board to bus and brought to the plane if it was not ready and no staff provided clear comments what was going on.

On a last return trip flights itself were faultless - well almost - my original seat was slightly out of the shape and I had to change seats once. However my complementary Dubai Connect overnight stay was a mess - after landing in Dubai a little over 1pm I finally got into hotel room just before 6pm. I spent all time waiting in queues. Also nobody at hotel knew how and what time I'm going to be picked up in the next morning. Next morning the Hotel staff advised me to take a taxi to the airport and that the bill will be refunded by Emirates. They were wrong - Emirates customer service basically accused me of being cheat after I requested refund for the taxi. I took a taxi but apparently I had to wait for some mysterious bus Hotel staff didn't know about - I would never request the refund in the first place if I new it will turn out this way. Basically - Emirates, don't over-promise if you can't deliver.";NEGATIVE

And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked, replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works (Emirates knew this before), we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help, for instance helping to find a hotel, a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had pre-booked a dietary request: Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint, some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude, in general Emirates is excellent, but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner. Disappointing and I do not know if I would recommend them.";NEGATIVE

There was Sterfan instead of Stefan (so letter r too much). I called Emirates to ask if this was a problem. This had to be changed, because at the airport this would cause problems and could not be changed. Cost was 47 EUR. Really absurd. This feels worse than a traffic fine because you drove 4 km too hard. I understand that this is something in the Terms & amp. Conditions state, but for me a reason not to choose for Emirates anymore.";NEGATIVE

The level of service I received in Emirates is equal to the service I got from Etihad Airways. Crew is very attentive to passengers needs, and are very convenient. I asked for little gifts for my children, they gave me four times (on each flight) a complete set of toys and miscellanous for kids. On the Perth section, we were only 127 passengers onboard the A380 and the flight was very pleasant, with a very fascinating InFlight Entertainment system. However, I got disapointed by the attitude of the Cabin Crew manager on one flight, and it made me think about never flying with them anymore. I saw this manager seriously harassing one attendant.";POSITIVE

Food was also rather uninteresting, staff 'forgot' to offer any drinks with the meal, very impersonal service. Not that flight was full.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-23;" |  Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in Düsseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.";NEGATIVE

Free floating Veuve Clicquot, very well mixed drinks and food choice. The full flat beds were extremely comfortable and the space was more than enough (I couldn't see my neighbor). Also I liked the idea of having your own minibar next to you. But I missed an amenity kit. This was a little bit of a negative point. Also there was a little bit of confusion during check-in. A lot of business passengers did not find their assigned waiting zone. The free Wifi is great albeit quite slow. Massive entertainment program like no other. All in all, a great experience.";POSITIVE

Later I made a complaint via email including the details. They took more than 5 weeks to reply and then just told me it never happened. From what I understand, this is par for the course with their customer service. I'm horrified by the customer service for this top-rated airline. I won't be flying them again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-20;" | Hong Kong to Newcastle via Dubai with Emirates. Had such a great journey back from Hong Kong yesterday. Flew Economy from Hong Kong to Dubai and slept most the way. Got woken up for food and loved it! Arrived in Dubai, used the lounge as I'm a silver member so got a shower, ate some food and then as I was boarding for the second leg of my journey from Dubai to Newcastle I got upgraded to Business class again! It's just what I needed for my eighth flight in two weeks! Needless to say Business class was incredible, the service was flawless and I had more than everything I needed for the flight. All the flight crew were lovely. Emirates never fails to disappoint me and for all these reasons is why I choose to fly via Dubai instead of direct from London to Hong Kong with BA or Cathay.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-04-20;" |  Appalling customer service from Emirates. All good from London to Dubai, but then we were told we were not booked on the flight from Dubai to Brisbane as it was over booked and they needed someone to take another flight. We had booked this flight and our seats 6 months before. So after an hour arguing with them we were permitted to fly but were given alternative seats next to the kitchen. Subsequently we could not sleep because of the noise plus my entertainment system was dead. I complained 3 times and was told they would reboot it but it never happened. So on my return I contacted customer service and was informed my it would take 30 days to look into my complaint. Here we are 52 days later and not another word. All in all very poor and disappointing service from Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-19; | Bangalore to Budapest via Dubai. My first international travel was with Emirates and it was quite pleasant. Airport transfer was a little bit confusing as the transit time was short which caused a rush in Dubai. The food and beverages provided were quite lovely in both the flights and the staff were more than friendly. Wifi connectivity was available but it was quite slow. The seat pitch was upto the mark and overall experience was pretty good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2017-04-19;" |  Dubai to Lisbon, EK191 on 17th April. Was this the same airline as we flew out on? The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told ""okay but it will be cold"". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef). The whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor - so if anyone from Emirates reads this I would hope they investigate. On the good side the flight was on time, seat comfortable and flight crew informative.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-19;" |  Lisbon to Dubai, EK192 on 8th April to Dubai for our sons wedding. This flight was superb from beginning with special assistance at Lisbon, on time, comfortable seats, informative flight crew, very good meal, through to special assistance at Dubai. The cabin crew were one of the the best we have come across, genuinely friendly on an a full flight, welcoming everyone onboard, regularly coming round to check that everything was alright and enquiring if we wanted more drinks and wishing all passengers a friendly farewell. Cost cutting was evident in that the seafood option has been removed as has the pre-landing snack/icecream, but the meal provided (braised beef) was tender and tasty and larger than previous. Price was higher than normal because we had to travel over the Easter period.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-04-16;" | Delhi to Amsterdam via Dubai. You know what to expect when you are flying with Emirates. The 777s are inconsistent in their economy class seats - some have USB ports and other have older seats. The food (AVML) is always superior and especially flying out of Dubai - actually the best plane food is served on Emirates. Seat comfort on 777 is sub-par in comparison to the economy seating in A380 which is the most comfortable I have been on in terms of leg space, seat width, recline and fittings. The quietest cabin on the lower deck on the A380 is the one at the back and yes, it does give a premium economy experience being exclusive with fewer seat rows. WiFi on board is inexpensive but can be spotty depending on the routes. IFE, of course, remains, fabulous. Cabin crew are mostly friendly - some are heartwarming and very helpful, while others forget their smile at home. All aircraft were very clean, have great in flight lightning including StarLight on the cabin ceiling (which I love) and well stocked, clean washrooms. The business class lounge in Dubai is sometimes very busy and the Concourse B one has the coveted Moet and Chandon bar which is a must visit if you have status. Showers are great and so is the food and service the lounge. Definitely recommend this airline.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-04-15;" |  Zurich to Cebu return vua Dubai.  On the outbound, there had been no weighing of carry ons. On the return, I used e-boarding passes.  When went to board the second flight at DXB, they weighed my carry ons at the gate and asked me to pay $241. This would have made the return 40% more expensive than the full ticket price. After some screaming, they let me on without paying. The other sheep all paid, and there were a lot of them. If you want to weigh something, weigh people and carry ons together. That would be fair.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-14;" |  Hong Kong to Cairo via Dubai. Emirates first class is a special travel experience. I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list! If you got the budget or mileage to upgrade, here's the way to do it to pamper yourself. I took one star off for the inconveniently closed Bangkok lounge due to renovations. A shared lounge (CIP) was used and it was very lack lustre..";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-04-08;" |  I made a return trip on Emirates where I had booked in first class from CDG to Colombo via Dubai returning from Lyon after a stopover in Dubai. On the return flights from CMB to DXB and DXB to LYS they made aircraft swaps (without warning and without any technical reason). They put a 2 cabins B777-300 instead of 3 cabins B777-300. So, I was downgraded twice (at different days and on different flights). I asked the refund of the difference of fares. Emirates denied it and made a refund of only 500€. As I had kept screenshots of my booking, I produced the screenshots to Emirates. Finally, Emirates  refund the actual difference of fares (total of 1 000 € as I asked). It seems that Emirates has aircraft swaps when they maybe have in mind that there are too few first class passengers booked on the involved flights.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-08;" |  Cape Town to London via Dubai. Flew Emirates on family recommendations and to be honest they were okay but not worth the hype. The 777 with the 3-4-3 configuration is uncomfortable and cramped. Asking £20 per leg to select seats is robbery when you are only transiting from one aircraft to another. that would have added £160 to the price of 2 return tickets. The crew were indifferent and did not really communicate with you, they were distant, I asked for a drink with my meal which never arrived and part of my meal tray was missing but by then I had given up. They seemed disorganised at service times. On 4 flights only had one 'comfort' bag with socks, eye mask and toothbrush in.  The A380 was a much nicer aircraft and reasonably comfortable and we did have a spare seat next to us. Food was again okay. Overall pay a bit more and go Qatar Airways. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-04-08;" | Milan to New York JFK. We were so pleased with our Emirates experience. The lounge at Milan was clean and well appointed and staffed by super efficient and friendly people. Our flight went without a hitch. Lots of leg room, variety of entertainment, and so many food choices. We fly international about 7 times a year and have sworn off Delta. We are so grateful to have found an airline that appreciates their customers. ";POSITIVE

Good choices. Food good - drinks on request and brought with a smile. Plane incredibly clean they have 2 designated cleaners on flight! On 777 to Arlanda again good service, food and space. Emirates have a lot of crew and it really makes a difference. Some tricky demanding pax excellently handled by Crew. I particularly appreciate the 2 meal over 6 hour flight service. Loads of drinks runs in between. One of the best economy carriers.";POSITIVE

We noticed some of our fellow passengers were quite rude to the staff at times, they did not seem to appreciate the effort the staff put into looking after them. Our sincere thanks and gratefulness.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-30; |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Nice economy class seats. Good inflight entertainment system. Good inflight catering and good wine. Quiet aircraft cabin. The gate was quite far in walking distance from the check in counter and also far away on arrival into Hong Kong. Friendly cabin crew. Extremely slow bag delivery in Hong Kong that drag down overall total. Waited 1.5 hr for the bag.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-03-27;" |  Dublin to Tokyo via Dubai. I secured a real bargain rate for a first class ticket. I did not see any evidence of cost cutting throughout the experience. Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers. The Timeless spa concession at the 1st class lounge I found to be a white elephant, unable to get an appointment and they did not mention this is only available at the main concourse B, after the long walk to concourse C. The only downside was not Emirates fault. A long reroute from Tokyo because of the tensions in the area and 11 hrs of heavy turbulance with the crew struggling even with the basics.  All in all couldn't fault them given the culture of cut everything to the bone by some airlines at the moment.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-26;" |  Seychelles to Lisbon via Dubai. There was a huge line of passengers to check-in. The waiting time at that line took us about 2 hours. The online check-in was not available. The local airport personnel was rude and unprofessional. Coming to Seychelles we had more then one piece of hand luggage, but leaving Seychelles they insisted on Emirates rules of single piece of hand luggage at 7.5 kilos max. The Emirates representative was absolutely helpless.  When I offered to pay extra for 2 kilos of hand luggage she just said there is no such option and she cannot help. Emirates do not respect their customers. The rules that are enforced are very inconsistent and depending on your departure airport, but in Seychelles I was told that they do follow the rules while at other places probably not.";NEGATIVE

I booked this flight six months ago and was travelling with infant so I had already selected bulkhead seats at the front of both legs of my journey. However, Emirates decided to change my seats two weeks before from 8A to 38D on DXB-ISB route making me furious. Upon calling them I was given the usual answer that the aircraft was changed which was a blatant lie as it was the same aircraft. Emirates need to honour the commitments they make as it was a nightmare with an infant moving right back in the aircraft so all the hypes of portraying itself as a family friendly airline was proved wrong. On the other hand IFE was great but food lacked taste and variety.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-20; |  Warsaw to Bangkok via Dubai. The planes were dirty.

emirates;2017-03-15; |  Karachi to London via Dubai. Truly disappointed with Emirates and the overall quality of service that's provided. My flight from Karachi to Dubai was really comfortable. However in Dubai the business class lounge was like you had arrived at the bus depot - big and impersonal. The staff was stoic and looked as if they would rather be anywhere but where they were. This is the second time while travelling business class the crew has informed me that they are running short on the main entree and I could not have the food at s later time as they were warming all the food together. The food which came looked unappealing and dry. I will try my best not to travel emirates again. It's become impersonal and now have an I don't care attitude.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-03-12;" |  Washington to Manila via Dubai. They weighed our carry on baggage and if you exceed more than the permitted 10 kgs, you had to pay approx. $50 per kilo. Usually in the past they don't weigh it, even the items that you bought inside Dubai Duty free. I paid almost $100 for my excess. They tried to make money out of the carry on luggage/back pack. I will not fly Emirates if price is the same as with other airlines. ";NEGATIVE

My problem started in Dubai when I was about to take my connection flight to Philippines. I bought some duty-free items at Gatwick airport and more in Dubai Airport to take home. I wasn’t told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passenger’s hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so. If I don’t pay $200 or reduce the weight I would not be allowed to board the plane. I was speechless, and not expected this behaviour from staff.";NEGATIVE

Great attitude, good sense of humour, professional throughout. Thank you!";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-09;" |  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news. But it can't be switched off.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-07;" |  My recent flight from Taipei to London via Dubai was thoroughly enjoyable, both night and daylight flights. Taipei to Dubai sector was full yet the crew managed to address passengers by name and were attentive. I love the onboard bar and despite full capacity, was rather empty, with most snuggled up to sleep. It was a 4 hour connection to London at Dubai. Even though the Dubai lounge with its facilities for relaxing, sleeping or dining, I had to wait 45 minutes for a shower to be available. However, I was refreshed for my flight back to London, the service was impeccable. Even after a Venison main course and cheese board lunch, the crew were inviting me to the bar for more snacks. I have noticed that the A380s on the Taipei-Dubai, Hong Kong-Dubai and Singapore-Dubai flights are newer seating than the London-Dubai A380s. My one small beef about Emirates Business Class is the seat itself. It must be narrowest - just an inch wider than the Economy I think. I am small, but I find it still too narrow compared to other airline seats which are 20-22 inches wide. One passenger I spoke to said he could not get any sleep and felt claustrophobic. I guess seat width has been sacrificed to include the clutter of the Mini Bar and Tablet (I've never seen anyone use the Tablet). Overall Emirates for me is good value, and cheaper than flying direct to Asian destinations, and I enjoy the break in Dubai anyway.";POSITIVE

On the first leg the Muscat flight was late taking off and caused me to miss my Glasgow connection. I had to wait 9 hours in the airport for the next flight. The late take off from Muscat was due to late arrival, cabin crew said they'd had to wait for late passengers, their service desk said it was due to technical problems and their complaints website said it was due to weather (taking 26 days to respond). On the last leg of the itinerary they cancelled the Dubai to Muscat flight without explanation and I had to wait an additional 5 hours for the next one. Their complaints department have refused any kind of compensation. I'll never use this airline again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-03-02;" |  Emirates A380 from Manchester to Dubai was modern and comfortable and staff although friendly and polite were kept very busy by a fullish flight. IFE probably the best in the sky and on a decent sized screen too. From Dubai to Jakarta was a much older plane with smaller screens but attendants just as nice. What let this airline down was the food. First flight they had only chicken left when they got to me so even though I was hungry I declined but imagine my surprise when later I saw the cabin crew tucking into the ""left over beef meals"" including the stewardess who had served me. On the second flight I was served what is probably the worst beef meal I have ever witnessed on a plane so again nothing to eat. My moto now is bring your own sandwiches whether the airline is budget or supposed premium class.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-01;" |  London to Dubai return. Appalling customer service with Emirates. I was taken seriously ill and collapsed at Terminal 3 Heathrow. Emirates made trying to get a refund nearly impossible. No customer care and branded me a no show when I was in front of check in and attended by Terminal 3 manager who spoke to the check in clerk. Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional £200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you £213. How is that for customer services. I would have expected more from Emirates and whilst the luggage allowance is greater British Airways offers a better customer experience. ";NEGATIVE

The IFE was amazing, plenty to choose from and that what is Emirates known for, but the screen was hard to press on it. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-03-01;" |  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline. For such long flights, it would be nice to have peace of mind that your family will be sitting together.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-28;" |  Singapore to Melbourne. Before boarding I was paged to see the ground staff which I did and was asked by a rude staff if I could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. I said no. Then during the messy boarding process I was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff, I was made to wait and treated as if I had done something wrong. The staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable. But after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast - really bad! No orange juice, the crew just said don't have and that was it. No water runs between meals. Before landing crew collected the blankets and started to drag them around passengers and dumped into the toilets! Overall an average mediocre flight, crew service not very professional. I was so tired and exhausted from this flight. Emirates is dropping in standards.";NEGATIVE

The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-24;" |  Phuket to Dubai. Aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. There was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. Eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal, both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. Discounting the delay, I was not overly impressed with Emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-24;" |  Manchester to Phuket via Dubai. Manchester check in and lounge very good. Boarded A380 seats 11E/F, not as originally booked as aircraft changed to an A380 from Boeing 777. Personally I find the A380 very claustrophobic and the seat most uncomfortable. there is limited room for elbows especially with the ICE tablet and seat divider screen getting in the way. No matter how much I tried, I could not get comfortable in the seat. Cabin crew were friendly on boarding but during the flight they seemed very elusive. A walk to the bar area on several occasions found that passengers in the bar outnumbered by cabin crew. Meals on this leg of the journey were less than memorable and service was poor. I am still waiting for the cheeseboard to be served even though I reminded cabin crew three times that I had not received it. And where is the chocolate that is mentioned on the menus but is noticeable by its absence? And there was no amenity kit provided, is this a cost cutting measure? On the Dubai to Phuket leg, the seats were much more comfortable for me than on the A380. The Boeing 777 was reasonably smart but was beginning to show signs of wear and tear, Cabin crew on this flight were OK but service was still below what it should be. Meals again were not too good, although we did get chocolates this time, but only because we asked specifically for them. An amenity kit was provided on this flight. In view of the cost of the tickets, I was disappointed at the level of service and the standard of food provided, although the Emirates lounge at Manchester had exceptionally good food on offer.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-23;" |  Hong Kong to Bangkok. Flying with Emirates short haul appears cheaper than most low-cost airlines in Asia. Emirates provides full service, with generous luggage allowance (30kgs) on Economy Class. The food was great as one can choose vegetarian or low sodium diet. The cabin is so spacious. One can barely hear the noise from the engine and the flight is so smooth. We did not feel that the aircraft has taken off and landed already. The cabin crews are very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Aircraft is new and well-maintained. This is the second time I flew Emirates using A380 and I will definitely fly with them again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-22;" |  I have been taking Emirates service between Bangkok and Hong Kong a few times a year for more than 6 years. Little has changed (although on the more recent A380s there is unfortunately no side pocket for books, iPads etc.), the meals and wines remain very good, the bar at the back is excellent, service is efficient and the lounge offerings better than most airlines. Plus I love the aircraft. But I have to bring up two issues. The IFE Guide used to be user-friendly. Now the airline has jazzed it up, it is a design mess and extremely difficult to read! Movies have no timings. What is the point of that, especially for short flights? To find out timings you have to open each channel and wade through ads each time. So if you are considering which of 4 or 5 movies to select you waste a lot of time and patience with the added possibility you'll miss the end of the movie before landing. Then there are the audio programmes. Once again the classical music section used to be hugely comprehensive. Now it is another mess. What is the point of having a composer's name as the title of a channel - like just Mendelssohn or Mozart - when the works being performed are not listed? Do we have to check the screen every time? If so, then even that often does not provide the information. Wagner wrote operas and so is understandably included in the Opera section (although with no works listed). Yet he also appears in the non-operatic section. To find out what that included, I started the channel. Nothing on the screen gave me any clue what was about to be played. Never mentioned anywhere is the fact it is the opera Das Rheingold - almost two and a half hours non-stop music and singing! No indication either of artists, conductors and orchestras, all of interest to those listening. Something really has to be done to include more pertinent accurate detail in the Guide. My other disappointment was having foregone the meal and watched a movie, when it was over I went to the bar to get some canapés. As I went to the nearby toilet to wash my hands, there were plenty available. Less than 45 seconds later, everything had been dumped into the trash bins - even though there were still 35 minutes of the flight remaining and drinks were still being served. Surely you don't get rid of bar offerings so quickly - at least until the descent has started!";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-21;" |  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting. This is simply the worst experience ever.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-02-18;" |  To me, Emirates hasn't changed much since my last trip with them in 2013. It still offers free train ticket (in Germany) that connects your home to the airport. Flights from Munich to Beijing via Dubai were on-time. Onboard service was great with a good selection of food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks. I went for some vodka and they served me Russian Standard, a premium vodka distilled in St. Petersburg. That was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of the trip was Munich airport. Emirates uses Munich's Terminal 1, which is very outdated and small, especially so when being compared to Munich airport's new Terminal 2. On our way back, at Munich there were only 3 immigration windows and a small luggage carousel for the 500 passengers from a fully packed A380.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-18;" |  Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed. Overall it was fine but I would not pay for full Biz Class on any EK flight. They really don't offer the high level of service that they show on TV.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-17;" |  New York to Male via Dubai. I am sitting in the Maldives a day later than I was supposed to arrive waiting for a sea plane for two hours, because Emirates overbooked my flight from Dubai to the Maldives. They kicked my husband and I off the flight with absolutely no other option. So we had to get up at 1am and take 4:30am flight to get into the Maldives a day late. Their rude clerks informed me this was my only option. Since we had to reschedule our sea plane to our island, I am stuck at another airport waiting for hours since all flights for today were already booked. Oh did I mention this is supposed to be my honeymoon. Emirates cost me a day and a half at my beach resort on my honeymoon. Their consolation round trip tickets are all well and good except I don't have any time off of work to travel again, and we really can't afford another vacation.  Their airline is supposed to be elite, but my experience has been inconvenient, rude, frustrating, demeaning, and enraging. This is unacceptable.";NEGATIVE

Service not very pleasant and mainly in Dublin airport the Emirates staff were quite unfriendly - all this from check in up to getting to the plane, was reminding me the situation from maybe 3-4 years ago with Ryanair. But Emirates is not low cost company! The service and food onboard also nothing extra special.";NEGATIVE

Food service offered but never materialised. Child meals later provided were unhealthy and inedible. During both legs of the flight there was a mad panic from the aircrew attempting to ready the cabin for landing as if this had been delayed until the last possible moment. The flight deck reminding them that we were at 10000 feet and they really ought to be sitting down. At the end of the flight there was an announcement that 'I hope the delay hasn't caused too much inconvenience' Really? Arriving home at 1am instead of 9pm with young children? Missing the last tube? Glib nonsense.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-02-17;" |  Flown with Emirates a few years ago and it was great. But this time, Emirates what has happened to you. The Glasgow leg I was so disappointed with no hot towels and very few drink runs. Ran out of meal choice of Lamb and crew looked disinterested. Was not looking forward to second leg of the journey. When my wife and I checked in they could not confirm that we would be sitting together on the second leg even though we had booked six months ago. Then it all changed, when a very helpful gent at the Emirates counter sorted us out with new boarding passes. It was the game changer for us. We got the best seats in the house right at front of plane 41a and 41b they were great. Food was great plenty of drinks runs, this crew were on the ball. The leading cabin Steward was very efficient in his duties and his manners were impeccable. Live Football, Wifi what a great product you have in the A380. Really enjoyed my time on your flagship route to Auckland. Will be looking forward to using you again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-16;" | Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option. Emirates is very much a last option for myself now.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2017-02-14;" |  London Heathrow to Dubai. The service we received today was appalling. This is the second time we have flown with this airline and the service has been consistently poor. First of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. The hostess snapped at me when I asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for. Another staff snapped and told us we should wait when we requested for juice to eat our meal which was served an hour after everyone had eaten, as our preferred choice had .";NEGATIVE

Boarding was very punctual and well organised. Warm welcome from the excellent cabin crew when I boarded and throughout the flight the cabin crew was just lovely and very attentive. Seats on the A380 are so comfortable and the IFE is just brilliant. There was just not enough time to watch all the new releases. The food was absolutely delicious (I had salmon and saffron rice), the service impeccable and the flight overall just amazing. Emirates is just the best airline I have flown with and I am looking forward to my next trip with them later in the year.";POSITIVE

Particularly like that the entertainment system is working as soon as you enter the plane. Plenty of hot towels throughout the flights. Downside would be the soups which were served either lukewarm or cold and the showers within the A lounge, which were dirty with mould staining. Highlight was the fish starter. However no waiting for the facility this time. Also found the quiet seating area. Chauffeur service very efficient and no delays on either flight despite late departures from both airports.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-08;" |  Warsaw to Hanoi via Dubai. There was a significance difference in the quality of service between the 2 flights. The mainly Polish crew on the Warsaw to Dubai leg were quite abrupt and rude. The chief purser seemed very stressed and the crew did not seem professional at all. The TV screens were also quite old and not very responsive. The Dubai to Hanoi leg was much better. We had more comfortable seats towards the rear of the plane and the crew were excellent. Especially, the Brazilian flight attendant who saw we were trying to take a selfie and kindly offered to take the photo herself. Her colleague even went and pulled down all the window blinds in the last few rows to make the photo clearer. I was seriously impressed with this level of attentiveness. So overall, Emirates is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the quality of the staff. Some are amazing, others mediocre at best - and some downright rude.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-06;" |  Dubai to Manila. I am a first time Emirates passenger. Boarding process was disorganized. Flight attendants seemed tired and never smiled. Even if I said thank you, not even a single response, just nothing.  There was no amenity kit given to Economy passengers. Food was so-so.

I am not happy with my first time with them but I have a return flight to Dubai with Emirates and I hope it will be a better experience from the first one.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-02-06;" |  Rome to Dubai. Very pleasant flight with A380. Check-in counters open more than 3h before flight, DXB offers an early check-in block counters. Fast boarding . The cabin crew on both flights were friendly as professional. A complimentary play kit was provided to the child. Our seats in both flights were on row 44 (economy starts at row 41) so we were in front of engines allowing a very quite and comfortable flight. Entertaining system boasts loads of movies, music, video and other information (also 3 real cameras). Meals were served prior to children and other special requests menu. Tea, coffee, juices, etc, never lacking. 6hr flight were spent pleasantly thanks to the cabin arrangements, ICE entertainment and spacious seat legroom. Overall, a fantastic experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-02-05;" |  Christchurch to Sydney. After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. We have flown Emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to New Zealand. Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal. If you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money. I know we were transferred at short notice but by taking us we were still entitled to expect certain standards.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-02-05;" |  Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai with Emirates. Reasonable check in, in both Glasgow and Bangkok. All flights arrived pretty much on time, even if late in departing. Usual variable cabin crew with BKK routes so-so, but much more attentive crews on the Glasgow legs. Economy class food seems to be improving in recent years though I think the IFE choice of films is not as good as it was. No remote stand bussing in DXB which is an improvement. Good availability of flights and good prices which are the main reasons I choose Emirates, though they are now charging £20 per leg to preselect seats in advance of the 48hr online check-in window which I find ridiculous.";POSITIVE

Changed onto a Boeing 777 in Dubai for the 13.5 hour flight to Melbourne - ouch! This aircraft was so cramped, width of seat excruciating and has put me off every choosing Emirates again. The fare was cheap and now I know why! Entertainment onboard was good, but couldn't distract from the pain and discomfort. To anyone thinking of Emirates on this Melbourne route, think again and choose another airline.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-02-01;" |  Dubai to Beijing in business class, and what a mistake. I could have routed through Doha or Abu Dhabi, but Emirates was a little cheaper for business class and now I know why. The Boeing 777 had seats in this cabin arranged 2x3x2, and being in the middle block I couldn't believe how cramped, uncomfortable and positively horrible this is. One expects this from premium economy, but not business. The IFE was okay, but I had expected something much more and realised they bulk up the quantity by many multi national offerings and a plethora of old (not proper classic) movies that other airlines wouldn't bother with. The cabin staff performed their duties, not with any friendliness or courtesy, and I'm glad my return route flights are arranged with China Southern who at least offer proper flat bed seats and comfort in business class. Never again via Dubai with Emirates.";NEGATIVE

From smooth check-in in Zurich through to transit in Dubai and a short connecting flight to Muscat, where we were served a snack and coffee / tea on a 35 minute flight, everything was perfect. The meal from Zurich to Dubai was delicious. I had ordered beef and it was tender and tasty. The cabin crew on both flights were very friendly, attentive and helpful. My seat on the A380 was very comfortable and inflight entertainment kept me entertained. On the flight from Dubai to Muscat I was seated at the aisle and even though the Boeing 777-300 has a 3-4-3 seating it did not feel crammed for me. Overall, a fantastic experience.";POSITIVE

From check-in, the flight crew, food and drink selection,  seat comfort and inflight entertainment selection, the experience was 10 out of 10!

At Heathrow we checked-in 3 hours in advance and it was very easy, however the staff didn't seem that engaging with the customer or enthusiastic, so I felt a bit dissatisfied. Check-in at the gate was also speedy considering the size of the aircraft. You get your passport checked before being called in for boarding. Again similar experience with the staff - no eye contact, no smile, and very low voice.  Boarding was well managed, my seat was on row 83. Very pleased with the seat size, legroom and overall cabin space. I consider myself to have long legs (183cm height) Food was excellent, metal cutlery and little details like chocolate and small snacks complement the meal well. The red wine was a highlight for me. Overall cabin experience was excellent including entertainment.";POSITIVE
emirates;2017-01-28;" |  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai. Emirates do not care and customer service is a joke. I received a bland apology and they flatly denied I was booked in as vegetarian, something which I double checked as I booked through an agent. Unfortunately I was served vegan food, which was appalling. They tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip. Not the gourmet food promised on their website. The cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible, but when I finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip - a meal which had been rejected by another passenger - it was a very hot, spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it. Not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and I am one of them. Dubai Airport is a disgrace - the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful. I was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate, (the gate number was on the pass, so that would not have been difficult) resulting in a long, last minute dash to the gate. On the return flight, finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible, and I and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen. The signage was inadequate. As for the Fast Track passes handed out on both the flights, these were meaningless and we were herded through with the rest of the passengers. A 15 minute (at least) bus ride from the plane to the terminal was the last straw. To summarise I paid three times the economy price for a lie flat bed and a few glasses of champagne. Not the exciting, wonderful experience promised by Emirates, and they are so big they really do not care.";NEGATIVE

The screen from Jakarta to Dubai was more interactive as it was a newer type of screen, depends on which aircraft one'll fly with. Food had a middle-eastern style taste and it was unexpectedly good. Wi-Fi was available, but didn't check it out. On the other hand, staffs were curt. The use of ""please"" from staffs can be increased. On the bright side, everyone still did their job. In a nutshell, hospitality can be enhanced.";POSITIVE

Most flights were delayed 7-8 hours on arrival in Gatwick. I explained this to Emirates without luck. Gatwick only had departures and not arrivals from 6am to 2pm that day. Emirates refused to put me on the next flight despite explaining that it was not my fault. As a result I lost 500 Euros and had to go back to Copenhagen, and my hotel bookings were lost. Holidays ruined by Emirates are not humane and they do not care about you! ";NEGATIVE

Pleased to see that there is a business class lounge in Yangon, shared with other airlines, as this is not mentioned on Emirates website. The lounge was very comfortable though with very limited food post-midnight. The cabin crew were very helpful on both legs of the journey and provided much better service on both legs than on recent trips. In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately. The food is never exceptional on Emirates but it was tasty. The New Zealand Pinot Noir wine was excellent. The cabin crew were very attentive in bringing and removing towels / food and drink. I didn't manage to connect to wifi, though this sometimes depends which country we are over.";POSITIVE

I flew four flights with them in a week, London Heathrow to Mumbai via Dubai, returning from Delhi to London via Dubai, and all flights were perfect. The sector DEL to DXB was delayed as Delhi airport authorities decided to shut the airport for an hour due to national day preparations so we sat there for an hour meaning that the time at Dubai for connecting my onward flight was minimal. However Emirates pulled it out of the bag and I made my connecting flight and my bags were there at Heathrow as well! Despite flying economy my seat was comfortable with plenty of legroom, the entertainment was superb with thousands of films and TV programmes to watch and the food was fine.

However, when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. Now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport, they let you ""get out"" of the dilemma by paying $75 (USA). Most passengers I met on board stated they had to pay this amount. When myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff, we were all rudely told ""you need to read the fine print and that it a new Emirates policy"". I was also shouted at by the senior manager in Cape Town because I asked him to explain why this policy was in place. After we argued for almost 30 mins, he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. They also ran out of food and I had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. Staff on board also don't seem to like their job as they don't respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. As a frequent traveller to all parts of the world, this is the worst airline I have ever flown. Emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff. I will never travel with them ever again.";NEGATIVE

Good points - prompt chauffer service at both ends, good lounge at Gatwick with reasonable range of food, wide range of films and the entertainment system is available as soon as you board, heated towels at regular intervals, comfy seating with mattress topper for sleep, fast track security pass. Negatives - patchy on board service, untidy and tired looking plane on the Brisbane leg, lack of sleep suits. Major problem was the transfer at Dubai. Gatwick flight's arrival into Terminal A was delayed by over an hour due to fog. We then found that the Brisbane flight was leaving from Terminal B, a train ride away where the Business Lounge is much poorer than in A. Due to restricted time for transfer my wife did not use the shower facility, the gents was ok but tiny cubicle. Went to the Boarding Gate on time but plane was parked off stand on the other side of the airport. Bus transfer needed and chaos seemed to ensue. We were at least an hour in the lounge/queuing on the stairs - not acceptable for business customers. Plane was then delayed leaving Dubai and arrived at Brisbane about 2 hours late. This created issues with our ongoing transfer. We are hoping that our return to the UK in Feb will not suffer the same delays.";NEGATIVE

We tried a lot to reason with the online customer service and ground staff but they refused to work around the issue. We were travelling with a 1 year old and it was a miserable 14 hours. After the long wait in the terminal, we had to board a 13 hour flight to New York which unnecessarily made our travel very hectic. There was an earlier flight to New York but ground staff refused. They were rude and belittling, likely due to lack of sensitivity training. They spoke broken English and got aggravated when asked to repeat.

My seat was changed a few minutes before boarding with this unbelievable reason “your child has autism so he can’t seat near the business area”! We were then moved to the lower deck to the end of the plane (from 27 to 87) where we could enjoy the toilet flushing sound throughout the 7hrs flight from Dubai to Birmingham. Not only that I was relying on my son’s pushchair as he gets tired walking long distance. They lost the first pushchair on the way to Dubai, texted me the next day and asked me to collect it, had to take taxi from Sharjah to Dubai, waited in the lost luggage office for hours to be told the text message was wrong and they haven’t yet found the pushchair. Ok, organized another pushchair and this was again lost on the way back to Birmingham. I have been calling their call center for the last 10 days, every time talked to a new person but same reply, “we will email Birmingham airport, they will get back to you”!  So far nothing has happened and I had to buy a new pushchair for my son. ";NEGATIVE

Very friendly, hard-working and charming team of international crew, a medium load, free wifi for 10 mb, or only USD1 for 500 mb, all made for a great journey. Catering standard was better than average, a great choice of drinks and wine etc. The bar at the back of the upper deck is a must do. A lot of passengers went to sleep, I was having fun with the crew counting down to the new year, a first for me on the air! If ever there was one minor imperfection, that would be the dining table of my seat, which was badly designed in a way, when opened and folded down, it cuts almost into my stomach (I am stocky). Dining was not exactly comfortable with this fatal design fault. I took one mark off because of that. Otherwise, it's a perfect 10 from me.";POSITIVE

There was money in the accounts but they couldn't take the money. I was advised to bring in cash to the airport on the day of travel. So I painstakingly managed to get 20,000 Rupees when currency was scarce in India and took it to the airport. The rude woman over the phone at the airport Emirates office just said she couldn't take my money because the call centre people didn't put the amount to pay on the ticket but it was confirmed conditionally? Didn't get that logic at all. So I had to call the call centre after putting some more credit as the average call time for a call to Emirates is a minimum of half an hour to an hour. Then the manager comes on the phone and directs me to someone else in the airport. I was due to fly at 9:20pm and hadn't paid for my ticket until 7:15 pm. I was scared to death as I had to report to work the next day.  The casual and careless attitude of the Emirates airport staff didn't help relieve the tension. Somehow after going through so many people and so many phone calls I have finally managed to pay for my ticket and nearly didn't get my change if I didn't impose on it. It has been an absolute nightmare journey with Emirates. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-01-08;" |  My flight from Dublin to Hong Kong via Dubai was pleasant. The flight is good value for money, cheaper than flights that I used to go on that connect through Heathrow. I felt the service was standard and comparable to other airlines I have flown long haul. The journey is split into two 8 hours flights with a layover between. Due to the timing of the dinner and breakfast service, getting a long period of rest was difficult. They were slow to turn off the cabin lights to allow passengers to rest. In the past when I went through Heathrow I felt the crew were quicker to serve the first meal and served the last meal much closer to landing, maximising the rest period. And they were quicker to turn off lights. In my second leg from Dubai to Hong Kong, a child had vomited at the back of the plane by the lavatory. The crew seemed to struggle to come up with a way to deal with it but they improvised in the end. I would have thought vomit on the floor would have been something they had a procedure for.";POSITIVE

emirates;2017-01-07;" |  Seattle to Thiruvananthapuram via Dubai.  I was travelling with my kids, which includes an infant. The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people.  I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs. The airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. The other passengers (elder people) were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that I can use the restroom. On our return flight, I had requested for gluten-free meal which was provided in the flight from TRV to Dubai but was denied on the flight from Dubai to Seattle stating that I had not made the choice, even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro. I do want to thank the crew on the flight from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram who were helpful and accommodating. They helped me out without even requesting. They took care of the baby so that I could use the restroom and also made sure that the passengers travelling with kids had a comfortable pleasant flight.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-01-06;" |  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day. Again, staff were slow taking more than an hour to process the 10 of us in the queue.";NEGATIVE

I won't be using this airline again.  Flight was delayed for more than an hour due to bad weather which one can ignore. However, flight from Islamabad to Dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. Staff was cooperative. But as soon as we landed in Dubai, we were like stranded. There was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. The fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. We had 18 hrs connecting flight to Bologna. It took us more than a hour to find the Emirates counter regarding hotel room. My mother cannot walk a lot. Finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room, Emirates staff was rude and denied us room. Finally, seeing condition of my mother I offered to pay for the room. Even then, the woman sitting on counter said her shift was over and she wont help us out. we should wait till after 5 (our flight landed in Duabi at 3:00PM). After waiting for almost an hour the Emirates took around 1100 Dirhams from us for one night stay (visa fee included). But all this process took around 4 hrs as we reached hotel at 7:30 PM , extremely exhausted. When we thought all that was bad was behind us, the flight to Bologna turned out to be even a worse experience. The air hostesses were not cooperative at all. The rating I give for Cabin Staff Service is only because of staff in flight from Islamabad to Dubai.";NEGATIVE

Purchased the ticket last minute due to sudden change of plan, approached check in desk 60 minutes before a supposedly 13:45 departure and was told off about being late. Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear. Despite such rudeness, service was slow and inefficient. They only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent. Inflight entertainment was good and a saving grace so that you do not have to speak with the crew.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-01-05; |  Bucharest to Perth via Athens and Dubai. Booked online thinking they are a 'premium airline' that offers great all-round service and the flights they had would get us home a bit quicker than our usual airline so we took a chance. Booking went smoothly until we tried to select seats! Couldn't select first leg at all (understandable as with another airline and of course directed to that airline that didn't even recognise the booking!). Second leg booked seats together OK. But site wouldn't give access to third leg - Dubai to Perth. Kept trying and after day of trying got access. 5 seats left and none together! You have to be joking. Booking made as two people. So they get your money but then you can't even sit together. Absolute joke Emirates. Needless to say we won't ever use Emirates again. We will stick to our usual airline in future. Unfortunately I see many have the same issue with seat allocations. Should have done my research better.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2017-01-04;" |  Paris to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai.I am disappointed with Emirates. The entertainment is excellent, the food is good, the seat is comfortable, the aircraft is clean, the staff are okay. My flight from Paris to Dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. The ground staff at Paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. We landed at Dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. We need about 5-10 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. There were 2 staff holding boards, for the Bangkok flight passengers and other destination. We checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. All of the Kuala Lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate, just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. We were very shocked. If it had waited 10 more minutes, all of the passangers would not be stranded at the Dubai airport, on new years eve. We were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. My family got lucky. We got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. We were rerouted, flying from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Dhaka, using Bangladesh Airlines. We paid for Emirates, got Biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. Amazing way to start the year. I would be much grateful if the ground staff and the cabin staff had communicated better and at least some direction or guidance from the Emirates for the lost passengers. I would be happy to never fly with Emirates again.";NEGATIVE

I had problems both legs of the return journey. Firstly our flight got cancelled from Maldives which caused a lot of stress and losses (time and money). They gave some skywards miles as goodwill gesture which were worthless. I have been going back and forth with their customer affairs team but getting nowhere. On the second leg home the service was diabolical, never have I experienced such bad customer service. Emirates really need to sort out their customer service.";NEGATIVE

We boarded the flight at Newcastle and found our seats were not the ones I had booked back in March! I told a member of the cabin crew and she said she would get her supervisor that didn't happen! So when we arrived in Krabi minus our luggage because that was left in Bangkok due to the late arrival our our Dubai flight I emailed Emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped, but I feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. Why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. What makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat I'd booked all those months in advance. I have since replied to them and asked the question again. I think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. I know to some people the seat saga is petty but it's a big thing to me. All I hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights. I will not say I won't fly with them again but it has made me think there maybe better airlines out there to try.";NEGATIVE

This was my first long haul flight, which I did alone so I was very apprehensive about luggage being transferred, reaching connections in time and the flight in general. I was pretty happy with everything overall. The seats were comfy, I ended up with a window seat with two empty seats next to me, which was great. The entertainment system was brilliant. Lots to choose from. The wifi didn't work too well, but that wasn't an issue. The staff were very polite and helpful, blankets, wet towels, warm towels, pillows and headphones all supplied. The food wasn't amazing but wasn't an issue either. The only thing I wasn't impressed with were the ground staff at Dubai. No one was particularly helpful when I asked about my luggage being transferred. Apart from that I was very happy with Emirates and I will definitely use them on my next trip to Thailand.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-12-31;" |  Bangkok to London via Dubai. Emirates is one of our favourite airlines. We have flown economy with them several times to Asia as well as to South Africa. We like their service, find the seats comfortable and have never experienced problems with the excellent ICE system. I hardly ever sleep on planes and find it comforting to have so much good entertainment during the long flights. We like the food. We have always had good experience with check-in, boarding and disembarkment. So when I had an accident during our last trip to Thailand and broke my ankle, I was fitted with an Aircast so that I could fly home. My insurance was taking care of everything but the one thing they refused, no matter how many times I asked or even with a written statement from my doctor, was to upgrade my husband so that he could be by my side during the long and uncomfortable journey home. I was unable to walk unaided and therefore needed personal assistance. I was upgraded to Business Class, which would have been a great experience under any other circumstances. As it was I daren't eat or drink much of what was on offer (all looked delicious) out of fear of being caught short bathroom wise. The Bangkok to Dubai leg in Business Class was full admittedly, but the Dubai to Gatwick leg was only half occupied. Rather petty to insist my husband sits downstairs leaving his injured wife on her own upstairs. Come on Emirates, you could have done better.";POSITIVE

Being an elderly person she can't walk for too long and she can't speak English, therefore we requested assistance with wheelchair access, which was all confirmed. However when she arrived in Dubai, my mother was left unattended, no one picked her up, no one gave her instructions, she had to make her own way to the next terminal fearing she wasn't able to make it, and we all know how big Dubai Airport is. She arrived in Melbourne exhausted and very stressed because of what happened to her in Dubai. She's an elderly women and very anxious to go back home in February, because she is fearing she could be left alone in Dubai again. I'm very disappointed about this event. ";NEGATIVE

Three out of four were on dated aircraft, the touchscreen small and the 3x4x3 seat configuration made the flights unpleasant. On the other side, the ICE system was excellent, with a great selection of movies, documentaries and games.The food was above average. The FA's were efficient, very helpful and with a smile. On the outbound flight, we had a 9 hour layover in Dubai, so the airline provided us a free hotel at the in Copthorne airport hotel, just 5 mins drive from the airport, with breakfast included. I coose Emirates because it was the airline with a straight flight to Cebu from the Gulf without a layover in Manila. I would recommend Emirates, but i think Qatar Airways is a better choice.";POSITIVE

On being shown our seats (very last ones in front of the bar) we noticed the ICE system wasn't working. We pointed this out and the crew said they needed to reboot it - this was done on take off but failed and wiped out more screens! As it was the night flight we decided just to sleep but to our horror the bed didn't work. This was sorted out but we were left with no ICE system. Staff said they'd report it and contact customer service when back home. The response was simple, no refund and we were offered some air miles! Not good service.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-12-27;" |  I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait, but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First, my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class check-in experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me, but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me check-in in the express check-in counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless, but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example, it took approximately 10 - 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich, and 15 - 20 minutes to provide me the ""um ali"" sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water, he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A, thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark, business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do.  I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-12-26; |  Mumbai to London via Dubai. Wasn't the greatest experience with Emirates - check in was a headache. We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming.  I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates? The entire business and first class were sold out on every leg we travelled so they have plenty of customers who are happy with Emirates product.;POSITIVE

We arrived in the morning local time and left in the morning local time. The food on the first leg was ok - not brilliant, but not awful just average. When we got on the next flight we were served a seafood lunch, at 9 am (ish) local time or 6 am as per our body clocks. Needless to say it remained untouched. Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future. Having said all of that it was relatively cheap for Business class so I guess in this instance you sort of get what you pay for. (Best food to date was on ANA, best seats on Qantas A380)";NEGATIVE

I have flown many times with Emirates business class from SFO to India, via Dubai. however my last flight with them in September was the worst and that is what this review is about.  Really bad food on the flights - so much so that for much of the flight I stayed hungry. I am not particularly finicky about food. This is not an issue with Dubai to India (shorter flight) but a real issue for SFO to DXB. On this occasion I swapped my Business class seat with my wife's economy class. Extremely rude staff, started an argument whether I can visit my wife in business class. This was lodged as a complaint with Emirates but I did not hear anything in the last 3 months. So rude staff, and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. Wife was pregnant and unwell, threw up on the flight in the Business class seat and requested that I be called from the economy section for a few minutes. The confused staff bumbled around for a few minutes and did nothing.  ";NEGATIVE

I am a pure vegetarian and I pre ordered it while booking tickets. But crew told vegetarian meal was not available when coming to me and then I have to argue with them to get my vegetarian meal.

The disappointing part of the journey were the cabin crew, they just didn't seem available and welcoming. They just seemed to be very tired and were too much involved and busy in chatting among themselves. Overall this leg was great, apart from the cabin crew. DXB to BNE was even worse in that field, the flight was already very long, which was stressful enough. I had a massive headache, and when I consulted one member of the cabin crew (she was a supervisor), she just told me to go back to my seat and watch movies, as they offered lots of choice. And that annoyed me, I thought cabin crew were supposed to be of support during a flight. The return flights from BNE to SIN, SIN to DXB were excellent, and even the crew were excellent and seemed professional and friendly. No comment on the DXB to LGW flight as it was well packed, so the cabin crew were busy - other than that I slept the whole flight so can't say much.";POSITIVE

However it was very obvious that the crew were struggling to provide a service. The flight lasted for 8 hours and within that time we only recived 2 cups of water, which had to be asked for. Once the meals were brought round, I was told that there were no more of what I wanted and had to settle for a the second choice. A few minutes later I saw one of the cabin crew serving my original choice and asked if I could change my meal. The reply from the cabin crew was that it was the last one. On opening the meal it looked as if it had been put through a blender and only ate half of the meal due to the fact that I was so hungry with only two cup of water previously.

A pleasant hot breakfast was served and the crew remained visible and active throughout the flight. Washrooms were kept spotless and well stocked with amenities including Bulgari cologne.

Positives - polite staff, seats comfortable. Negatives - service and amenities. Husband not able to use IFE controls as it had jammed. We ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. Waited one and half hours after first course for cheese (we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course) - told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin, even those behind us. After showing our displeasure, they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. Why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone? On a long flight that arrives at night (2am), we wanted to sleep - not an amenity bag in sight. I asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. Well I'm sorry but when I board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then I expect an amenity bag. That is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little (paid for) luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. Having paid thousands for business I do not expect an airline to be so stingy - they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. People do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. This is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry I thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. I have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. I was so excited to fly with Emirates as I heard good reports, but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money.

It was so comfortable, the in-seat entertainment the best we have seen and the staff, both in the air and on the ground, were helpful. We spent twenty eight hours on four flights and the staff did everything they could to make us comfortable. The check in staff were friendly and the process swift and easy. Their uniforms are smart and professional. Boarding was simple and, because there were three gangways, one to upstairs, it was quick. The A380 is quiet. The food was very good. The lighting onboard was perfect. During night hours it's a dark gently blue ceiling with twinkling stars. At dawn, it is exactly that. The entertainment system. Three external camera views and one little oddity that I found a complete Godsend. On the music section, I found a sleep hypnosis track by Anna Rowe. My mistake was putting it on ""repeat"" because some way into it, I had gone. But then when it started again, it woke me up! The seats were comfortable and a good non-intrusive recline. The usual cushion, blanket, headphones etc. If you bring your own headphones/noise cancellers etc, make sure enough bring the double-plug airline adaptor with you because their headphone sockets are dual-plug. You can use your mobile, get data and charge devices. The plane has its own mobile service for you to connect to, watch out though, it's not cheap, so best to go on airline mode in case your phone auto-cones and someone rings you from home.  We always choose either side of an aisle, not far from the loos. Economy class, at the front, there are four loos, which is very good. and they were very clean.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-25;" |  Delhi to Sao Paulo via Dubai. From the chauffeur pick-up and drop to boarding, the experience was very smooth. The cabin was lit with mood lighting and both long haul aircraft had the StarLight, unique to Emirates, a feature I find amazing - to lie down and look at stars while you fly! Cabin crew service differed on the long hauls, inconsistency is the name of the game for cabin service in Emirates. The crew from Rio to Dubai could not do enough for you while the attendant on the Dubai to Sao Paulo leg was asking passengers to lift out the tables for dining! The seat itself is comfortable in a lie-flat position but has terribly limited storage. The IFE is fantastic. What Emirates misses is the dine-on-demand on ultra long hauls and pyjamas. The amenity kits by Bvglari and clean, well stocked washrooms were very welcome. WiFi on board was available on both long hauls. What I love on Emirates is their food but it was disappointing on the flight from Rio due to probably a lack of catering's understanding of an Asian Vegetarian Meal. The transit in Dubai gives you access to the trimmings in the Business Class Lounge along with a Moet and Chandon Bar, shower facilities, healthy cuisine etc. All in all, a very glamorous, luxurious experience and will recommend.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-22;" |  Dubai to Doha. Discounted economy travel at its best. On time, great aircraft, terminal and staff great. 5 star service at a one star price. If you can, take Emirates on these short hauls. I also picked up an egate card on the way out. Too easy. Adds to the experience. Even faster. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-21;" |  Manchester to Dubai. . A full business class cabin but a very pleasant and enjoyable flight from Emirates. The aircraft was new and had the latest version of ice digital widescreen with a mind boggling selection of films and TV shows. On this morning departure from Manchester we were served continental breakfast and then lunch. Food was plentiful and delicious. The guinea fowl main was particularly good. Not something often served on an plane. With 42 passengers in business the crew were kept busy but were friendly and no request was too much trouble. Washrooms were kept clean, and stocked with cologne, toothbrushes, shaving kits etc. We landed on time, immigration and baggage delivery were fast and I was in the limo within 30 minutes of landing. The only slight negative was that they ran out of one of the red wines, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir, which was understandably popular.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-18; | Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. A wonderful journey with Emirates. The ground staff try their best for passengers. The seat was large for economy and the space felt good. The cabin crew from Rome to Dubai was a bit grumpy but the entertainment flight was excellent and I enjoyed it.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-15;" |  London Heathrow to Dubai. Had heard great things about the airline and my wife and I were looking forward to the flight/holiday. What a disappointment. The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping.  When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional.  All in all, a pretty disappointing experience.  The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry. Will only use this airline if I really have too. We had a wonderful holiday in Dubai but the return flight left a bad taste in the mouth.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-15; | New York JFK to Guangzhou via Dubai with Emirates. Where is the service heading? Does their management know? The AVML food on this route specially from JFK is horrible. Staff are becoming lazy and so talkative amongst themselves rather than focussing on the service. Water bottles are so small you have to keep asking for water and then an attitude is shown to you by the staff. I know this is a growing airline but if the growth is not controlled it will be a downfall for them soon.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-14;" |  Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Auckland. Seat 23K on upper deck of the A380 rear cabin. This leg was upgraded to Business by invitation, thus I was not eligible to access the lounge, which was fine. Upon boarding, ground crew saw my Boarding Pass and allowed me to enter the waiting area, which led to early boarding, that was quite nice. The cabin was almost empty to the point I was the only seating passenger at the rear. Crew members were all overly friendly and took their turns to greet me individually by remembering my surname - I never felt so spoiled. One flight attendant even handed me an amenity kit, which was not complementary for such a short hop across the Tasman. Bar service was exceptional as well, I was invited to have a drink and talk to the crew members, who are not shy at smiling towards the passengers and being professional at the same time. Breakfast was tasty, signature sweets were particularly delicious. I consumed two bottles of drink from the mini bar, and it was replenished in-flight. WiFi was slow and hard to use. The cabin flown was not fitted with the airlines' brand new products, edges and corners have started showing some tiny wear and tear - this was the only drawback that I am able to think of. The crew members deserve the highest praise, I felt that they walked the extra mile to maintain a conversation with me, just like being with friends. I am looking forward to flying with them again sometimes in the near future.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-13;"Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai. Check in good in all airports. I'm Skywards Silver, so boarding is good. All flights pretty much on time but arrival in DXB and having to bus from a remote stand to the terminal is nonsense. As usual variable standards from the cabin crew - infrequent drinks runs and disorganised meal service resulting in myself and another passenger, not even being offered a meal - it's not exactly very complicated, and the flight was only half full. Emirates are well priced and reliable and I make use of the lounge in Dubai but the service in the cabin is average at best and too often pretty poor. Emirates were better a few years ago but standards have not increased as fast as their route network.";POSITIVE

emirates;2016-11-12;" |  Manchester to Dubai return on the new 2 class A380. The plane is basically a flying cattle market and it is obvious that Emirates are moving towards to a pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap service, except that it's not so cheap. The service from cabin crew was virtually non-existent apart from serving the meal and collecting headsets/blankets at the end of the flights. Call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. No drinks runs other than with the meal. Seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class A380 (no doubt to cram more seats in). Emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months. I used to sing the praises of EK, but not any more. Will be flying with Qatar Airways next time.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-11;" |  As part of a Sydney-Singapore-London-Sydney trip, flew with Emirates on a Qantas ticket. EK335 from Singapore to Dubai and then connecting to EK7 to London. The aircraft's are in impeccable shape and the usual, low, levels of noise with the A380. Comfortable flight in both cases. It has been noted that the FA quality can be variable. On these two flights the FA's were pretty good and attentive. One with Emirates is that they have their FA's clean up the cabins. That means collecting rubbish, blankets, headphones, whatever is not tied down. It bugs me as I just do not think it is a good look for the airline to have their staff act as cleaners and rubbish collectors. That is the job of the ground crew and its messy to look at with bags of blankets walking up and down the aisles. The IFE is less good than you think. Movie selection is great when you have many hundreds but not when they are mostly foreign language. The English selection is poorly made up and could not find many or any I really wanted to see. Overall a solid experience with EK";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-07;" |  London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-03;" | Arriving in to Delhi from Kuala Lumpur, I was in the transit zone to catch my flight the next morning with Emirates with a final destination to Lisbon. I had no checked luggage and warned Emirates prior leaving (early that morning) of my arrival in order to allow for a smooth transfer and me to check-in at the hotel in Delhi Terminal 3. I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues. AirAsia, a budget airline, ensured that I would be brought to the transit area and confirmed twice (additionally to my early confirmation) with Emirates staff in Delhi that I would be arriving. Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up. Needing a ticket to pass the security in the transit area, the Emirates staff had to go and print it outside. so I was told. I was expecting this to be already printed upon my arrival as everyone was warned. This not being that case, I was told that it could be arranged in 15 minutes. It took a total of 6hrs during which I was told constantly every hour that it will be another 15 minutes by Emirates staff. I couldn't sleep all night and obviously didn't get to the hotel in terminal 3. On top of this, no upgrade was available on the flight to allow me to get a bed when when I was promised by staff that I could do this at the gate counter. Some staff were completely incompetent by either constantly pointing at other individuals saying that they couldn't help me or giving wrong information. Overall, I can say that this has been by far the most unpleasant experience I have had with an airline which ruined the first 2 days of my 1 week holiday in Portugal. I simply cannot comprehend this lack of professionalism from a company like Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-02;New York JFK to Doha with Emirates. I've come to love the service provided by this airline. Very affordable tickets to begin with as I was flying in the off season. Efficient check in process. Awesome inflight amenities. Food has been a very pleasant experience. I love the A380. It is spacious and quiet. Love the lighting. Crew are attentive and professional. Inflight entertainment is the best in the business and quite clear as to why that is. I really don't have anything negative to say about this airline. Efficient in its timings as always. I will always consider this airline whenever possible. I just wish that they would start flying to Philadelphia.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-11-02;" | Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. This perhaps is my worst flight experience ever. My flight and seat was booked and confirmed 3 months in advance. When arriving back at Dubai airport for my Dubai - Frankfurt flight EK045, they informed me that the flight was over booked and refused me check-in despite arriving more than 2 hours before departure because I did not do online check-in. Apparently my seat has been allocated to another passenger. They offered me the next available flight and free ticket but I refused as I was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in Frankfurt for a meeting. The customer service said that I have to wait until check in is closed to see whether is there any available seat. After waiting until almost boarding time, they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. Onboard, I checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65C which is right next to the lavatory. Throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey, it was just horrible. I'm entirely fine with me with people going in and out of the toilet. But every half and hour or so, someone and somehow loss their sense direction and came knocking into me. Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed. Obviously I was the last to board the plane and the last to leave the plane in this flight. To me, this is unacceptable for a world class airline they claimed to be. Even a budget airlines has better service than the Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-02;"Mauritius to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. The night flight from Mauritius to Dubai departed 11 pm. Business as usual, very positive reception on the aircraft, hand luggage was stored away, crosscheck and takeoff. Then Emirates showed their way of customer care once again. First beverage service 90 minutes after take-off together with dinner - actually not a meal but disgusting. After lights were turned off part of the crew was gathering in the service-station directly behind row 51 to loudly exchange their experiences on Mauritius while slamming some compartment doors. Passenger complaints did not bother them at all. Any cabin sevice was discontinued. Even on request. I never ever was confronted with such a rude cabin crew behaviour - Fly Emirates does not mean Enjoy Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-11-01;" |  In short: Unprofessional and rude cabin service, awful meals, dirty cabin, and most annoying is that the cabin crew just don't seem to care about anything. I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ICE system is good, but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function - who has square ears? EK385, was met at BKK airport with stairs on the tarmac about 20 minutes after landing, and free bus ride to the terminal. Even LCCs like AirAsia afford their passengers an air bridge to walk into the terminal.";NEGATIVE

I asked for a hot chocolate during the meal time, it took ages and I had to ask another flight attendant. When it arrived it was cold and had been filled with cold milk. I made a complaint to the purser, she apologised and they served another one. During the dessert, they served ice cream, but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. We ended up with the tea stirrer. Furthermore, I saw a flight attendant queuing for the toilets in front of me, and refusing to assist passengers. Usually, they use the toilet at the far end, in the back. I really regret picking Emirates.";NEGATIVE

However due to the delayed take off, I was sprinting through Dubai airport in order to not miss my flight to Houston, reaching it just 3 mins before the gate closed. Such a delay is not my first experience with Emirates. Staff onboard were just okay except one - the rest of them all seemed stressed out. The economy class seats are extremely uncomfortable for a 16+ hours long flight. Non-spacious and no leg space.

I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777-300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats - it was now 2-3-2 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out, the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lie-flat seat, which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down. If they had not indicated that this was going to be a A380 I would never have flown with them and given them my money. Emirates then did an about face when I contacted them via email saying its well within their rights to change equipment and not inform passengers! Really for all their big hue and cry of looking out for passengers its pretty obvious that they could not care less. Not even a decent apology for pulling the old bait and switch and then feigning ignorance.";NEGATIVE

The cabin crew was friendly and they are busy so take time if you request something. The food is not special, the toilet is clean. And when 30 minutes before landing the cabin crew will take your blanket and headset, and that make me uncomfortable, I think they shouldn't do that.

Although our seats had been booked prior to arrival at the airport we were advised to change them by the check in clerk who said we would have four seats between two of us in one particular row. This was not so. Although we passed one man who was stretched out across several seats to himself, the two other seats in our new row were occupied by the largest lady on the aircraft plus her hand luggage. It happened to be my birthday on the day that we flew and I must say it spoiled my birthday somewhat. When we flew two days later from Dubai to Johannesburg, boarding staff asked how my birthday had gone, I replied that since she had brought it up it had been spoiled by the events during the previous flight. I was then told to request a particular row on this flight where we could have better seats as some way of recompense. When we boarded the plane once again, we were let down and the seats were not available. I tweeted and complained formally to Emirates about this. It actually took them 32 days to reply and that was after prompting and more tweeting. Many tweets and private messages on Twitter were actually ignored. When we eventually received a response it was disappointing and did not even refer to the fact that one passenger had four seats to himself. I have never come across such poor customer service to be frank. We certainly would never fly with Emirates again. ";NEGATIVE

Second part of the journey Bangkok to Dubai with a flight coming from Hong Kong seats assigned could you imagine all dirty, made me sit on them until other place was free, it was really dirty, in the end after some complaint got me a place on the rear of the plane - at least the plane was half full so could stretch a little and sleep all the way. Final leg to Lisbon on my favorite Boeing 777 because it has a fantastic last three rows with 2 places and lots of space.

Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay. If you have an issue on the flight don't count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything, try and get what you want while your on the flight.";NEGATIVE

The chauffeur service provided by Emirates for business and first class customers is amazing. Also the best IFE that I have seen. There is free wifi on board upto 10MB however it is very patchy and I didn't have connectivity for the most part.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-10-18;" |  Guangzhou to London via Dubai. The best thing about Emirates is their cabin crew who are excellent. The worst thing is their business class seats which are appalling on their older A380's. To get into the seat is very tight unless you are a fashion model, if you are anything but a model then the tray that pulls out for eating is just crazy - I would need to lose at least 3 stone to be able to use it. It will not go past my tummy and what pregnant women would do is just beyond me. On the later A380's they have changed this tray realising that their first effort was hopeless and very badly designed. However their is very little space in this business class seat and I was very disappointed. Travelling often on business to the Far East this has to be the worst seat I have ever sat in. The food is OK but not being able to put it in front of you is frustrating. The crew know all about this problem as they told me they often get complaints. Add all this to the extra long flight by travelling via Dubai and I will be going back to good old Far East airlines who fly direct.";NEGATIVE

Only item were Emirates have ample room for improvement is on-board catering, where Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines are much better, but I do not fly to eat well, would always prefer a better seat and IFE above better food on ultra-long haul.";POSITIVE

Emirates A380s compared to European airlines A380 aircrafts are a totally different experience: cabin nice and bright, seating comfortable with nice seat pitch and amazing inflight entertainment. My Asian vegetarian meal was excellent. A staff member from another part of the cabin served my meal. She spoke Slovenian and this was such a nice gesture. The whole cabin crew nice and professional. I hope that they will add more transatlantic routs from Europe. They are above the European standards, not to even speak about substandard transatlantic economy product of US airlines.";POSITIVE

My first time on Emirates, the A380 is a great plane to travel being spacious and quiet - I felt less fatigued than normal I think its spaciousness may be a factor - plenty of toilets and comfortable seats. The Boeing 777 300 is a good plane and looked quite new although the seats didnt seem quite as wide as on the A380. The service was good and I thought the food and drink service above average. The cabin crew were efficient. We arrived on time, the travel experience was very good.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-10-14;" |  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.";NEGATIVE

They were very efficient, helpful and able to provide exit row seating for our three passengers who were 6 foot and over.

It was a full flight and the attendants did an excellent job and you could see they enjoyed their work.

The seat/bed is spacious, stylish and comfortable. The selection of beverages and food average and the service on this flight, appalling. The staff made flying business feel like the new economy. They do not make eye contact, answer the call bell, return with requests (even if you ask four times at twenty minute intervals) or serve you breakfast if you ask not to be woken for it (regardless of your slumber status). They do: congregate in the guest onboard bar/lounge talking loudly in a manner that could lead you to believe they were having their own cocktail party.";NEGATIVE

I was amazed by their IFE - so many movies, games, etc. I didn't use the WiFi.  The flight attendants were really friendly and I enjoyed the fact that they have a crew on board that can speak so many languages. The food was also very good. One thing I thought was a bit annoying that you only have that big assortment of movies on the longest flights, so I could watch many more movies from Durban to Dubai than from Dubai to Brussels.

emirates;2016-10-07;" |  Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777-300ER was just 11 months old, clean, tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples. it felt spacious and comfortable. The 3-4-3 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue, however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice (FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori). The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 3-4-3 economy layout. this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable, and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older, with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional. my partner's screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent, both for me (normal diet) and my partner (vegetarian-lacto-ovo). The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent, particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didn't feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic, as I said above you didn't really feel overly welcome or waited upon (it's not their main job but it's nice to be looked after). Check-in staff at Glasgow were helpful, pleasant and efficient, but we were caught unawares by the strict (weighed at check-in) 7kg carry-on limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partner's case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repaired/replaced. Emirates were initially helpful, sending me a form to fill out and asking for photos etc, but 3 weeks later we have heard nothing. In this respect Dubai-based customer service needs to improve.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-10-06;" |  Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent! The aircrew were truly professional and made every effort to accommodate us. Hopefully our next trip with Emirates would be better experience. The weak link as always is the ground staff. Reservation, check-in, ground crew.";POSITIVE

British Airways started this process of revenue some time ago but it lost the respect of clients.  This as a concept works for a couple or single passenger but if your a elderly or a family this is a disaster. I just had to pay 120 euro for a normal seat in 44A/C, no extra leg room etc just to ensure my parents over 73 had a seat together. Emirates,  greed over service.

Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment.  On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule. The journey was comfortable and pleasant enough although let down by a haphazard soft product and poor food offering.";POSITIVE

During this period of long-waiting time, Emirates didn't make up anything for us. There was no meal voucher, no nothing. I won't rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly, during my whole itinerary, I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal, or from terminal to flight. It's definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed, hot bus, and the transit time was long. I travel average 8-10 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide. I have never experienced anything similar before (with other airlines).";NEGATIVE

No one even bothered to ask whether we need anything for the baby - when I asked a crew member I need to make formula for the baby she asked me to wait till the service over, that is for another half an hour. Can a baby wait like an adult. I wanted to wash her milk bottle and she asked me to go to the washroom. No helping hand at all. Luckily I had my parents with me to help. Even though they advertise they give a baby kit, no one came to us when the baby started crying. I must say if you plan to travel with an infant don't select this airline. ";NEGATIVE

Some of the crew on certain legs were fantastic while others fail to make a mark remaining within borders of being professional and nothing else. The crew on the Sao Paulo to Dubai leg were fabulous - very warm and attentive. On ultra long haul flights, the seats seem to recline a lot more on a lie-flat arrangement. Hot towels, Bvglari amenity kits, very soft and warm blankets and well stocked washrooms await onboard on these ultra long haul flights. Some of the cabins had the StarLight belongs only to Emirates - bringing a great mood in flight. Emirates, while being a great airline, has inconsistent cabin service onboard which is surprising. The ICE entertainment system was spectacular - the best in the skies. What I give it to Emirates for is their food and it's quality - marvelous! There are 3 meals on the 14 hour leg - in addition to main meals, there is a light bite service. Due to the lack of on demand dining, they have snacks in the galley in between for the hungry.

Our flights home beginning on August 3, 2016 had us travelling with British Airways, Emirates and JetBlue Airways. We had no issues with our flights on British Airways and Jet Blue. Our luck ran out upon dealing with Emirates for our return flight home. I called Emirates August 2, 2016 (24 hours prior to our flight) to request kids meals and a vegan meal for 3 of our passengers. While on the phone with the representative, I inquired on our current seating arrangements to ensure the children would be sitting with the adults in our party. When I provided the booking number for my husband, I was advised his ticket was cancelled. You can imagine my shock upon hearing this. I asked the representative why it was cancelled, who cancelled it and when. I was advised it was cancelled July 24 – 1 day after we started travelling – and 6 months after booking the flight. The representative advised Emirates cancelled the ticket as they saw 2 tickets for a Brett Hale. My son’s name is BH Jr and my husband is BH. There is no space to enter a suffix within the Travelocity website. However, it is noted that one ticket was a child’s ticket and one was for an adult. In addition, I had to input the date of birth for each traveler.I never once received a phone call or email from Emirates to confirm I did in fact book a duplicate ticket. And I did not receive a refund for the cost of a ticket that they cancelled. After the representative informed me that Emirates made the error in cancelling my husband’s booking, I requested his ticket to be reinstated as it was, so we would all be travelling together. I was told that the second leg was full and that wasn’t an option. While informing the representative that that was not acceptable and that Emirates needed to find a way to ensure my husband was travelling with us, I was told he would send an email on an “Urgent Basis” and someone would be in touch with me. At this point, it is 7pm and the first leg of our flight home (via British Airways) is at 8am. I had been on the phone with him for over an hour. We were in a game reserve in the middle of South Africa and my cell phone did not have service. He advised I could try calling back in an hour. Long story short, it took over 4 hours and multiple phone calls to multiple people to get his ticket reinstated. Even then, I was not confident he would be flying home with us. I was extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service and how they handle their own errors.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-09-19;" |  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time. I will never fly with them again and I would recommend others to choose another airline.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-09-19;" |  Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress.  Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions.  Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers.  One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. Overall, I am quite disappointed with Emirates and next time I fly this sector, I might seriously consider other airlines.";NEGATIVE

I have flown several times both in Economy and Business Class. I have flown in Business Class both on the Airbus A380-800 and the Boeing 777-300ER. Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking. In Economy Class, you also have the possibility to see the menu and they pass with drinks many many times.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-09-12;"For my first flight on Emirates, it was fabulous. Even though the flight left at 2.40am (which meant we had to sit around in Melbourne Airport for 7 hours, as we arrived from Wellington), the crew made it bearable. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. The flight was operated by a newish 777-300ER (A6-ENG) which was great. The ICE system was faultless, which on top of the generous size of the screens made the flight fly by. The seat size is a problem however, the 3-4-3 configuration is just mean. But the foot room was better than any other economy class. The food on-board was very average for Economy, as a small snack was provided after take-off and then before landing a large Breakfast was served. I also really liked the fact that the crew handed out hot towels and face wipes before takeoff and before landing. An added bonus was the great (but understandably slow) Wi-Fi, a first for me on a plane. All in all, I would definitely fly again, which I will be in April, but this time on an A380, which should be excellent.";POSITIVE

Gone are the days when on the evening flights you got a small amenity pack, even in economy. They have a great TV system but more often than not, the crew are surly, seem not to want to work and if you want a drink, you do have to keep buzzing for it. Whilst the newer A380 planes are great and a lot more comfort, the older B777 planes can be OK dependant on the crews!";NEGATIVE

Flew the week (a few days) after the incident at Dubai Airport and although there were delays out of Johannesburg we managed to catch our connection to Athens the next day courtesy of efficient ground staff at Dubai Airport. Arrived on time in Athens but without luggage which was a ""pain in the neck!"" apparently due to operational issues. Fortunately we were headed directly to the Greek islands where a swimming costume is all you need. Luggage arrived within two days but Emirates flights on all sectors were a pleasure and you will use them again on my route next year.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-09-04;"Los Angeles to Beirut via Dubai with Emirates. Excellent service and wonderful crew. Airport check in was a bit slow and staff looked like they didn't know what to do. Aircraft was super clean and comfortable. Smooth flights, A380 tend to handle turbulence really well. Inflight entertainment was a 5-star and food was okay. But they run out of choices repeatedly once its your turn at the back of the aircraft. As I said, on board cabin crew are very professional. I would highly recommend and fly again. Excellent service.";POSITIVE

The legroom was enough, the food was adequate and delicious, the cabin crew were attentive and smiling. Everything we asked was provided. The wifi was good and very cheap. The check-in in Warsaw was easy and pleasant. They offered us a meal voucher because we had a 4-hour stop at Dubai. Everything related to the flight was great. However, the experience at Dubai airport was disappointing.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-09-03;" |  Upgraded to First private suites on Brussels to Dubai using 777-300ER. A very agreable flight of course, but with a long series of problems that should not occur. After take-off, the seat could only operated through the large TV touch screen, not through the remotes, which is a bit painful as the creen is about 1m from the seat. This was fixed after 15 min. Then the TV screen started going black for 30sec every 10min while the soundtrack of the movie still played. The system was reset and then worked fine. Although only 3 people travelling in the First class cabin, crew brought a wrong entree, and insisted it was the right one even it was obviously not the case. After 10 min they apologized, and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. Halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed, but I could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. I must say Emirates' first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the A380s. Upon arrival in Dubai, I used Emirates chauffeur service, was assigned one of their cars but the driver told me he didn't know the (Meydan) hotel and asked whether I could guide him. Which I could not, so I asked for another car and driver, and left the car. But the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted I wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver. I did not want to wait at midnight with 36C temperature outside, and only after insisting really hard did they call another driver.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-09-01;" |  Manchester to Tokyo Narita via Dubai. First leg from Manchester to Dubai was very good in A380 with good legroom and excellent inflight cabin service. However, WiFi did not work. Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Narita was very cramped. Emirates have taken off 1 inch from each seat to squeeze additional one seat in a 3-4-3 configuration. This makes the seating very uncomfortable. ICE system did not work very well. Return journey from Osaka to Dubai was also bad. Boeing 777-300 cabin had a dated look. Seating very uncomfortable. My seat did not recline. Passenger sitting next to me had to move as that seat would not recline either. Toilets were dirty and had no water in the basin to wash hands. Cabin crew very slow in serving any foods/drinks. It took over three hours before any drinks or food was served after departure. Headphones did not work properly. Had to try 3 different headphones before I found one that worked. Airbus A380 from Dubai to Manchester was fine. I will avoid flying on Emirates Boeing 777-300 to Japan in future.";NEGATIVE

I pressed the bell 6 times and the second time 4 times on another connecting flight, but no one showed up. The service from Europe was no better. I waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag (there was a line for both toilets). Service so slow and they act like they are doing you a favour. I asked for a red wine and got a cup of tea! When I mentioned this I still did not get the red. Two Sauvignon blancs is not smart for a choice of white wines. On board ICE entertainment system clumsy. Chaffeur did not confirm and we had to chase them to see if we were being picked up for two legs of the trip (website section said booked but empty?). Business lounge outdated and they have the childrens play room down in the smoking section. What has happened to my favourite airline?";NEGATIVE

Staff are the same as every other lounge. Service In Flight: The first time in my experience of flying business class that I was not greeted with a welcome drink, while other people in the cabin received it. I had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff - an overall indifference.  The only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. I think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. There is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming.  Even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. Food quality varied - some were delicious, the others not. Seating was very uncomfortable.  I was reconsidering my decision to upgrade. I couldn't sleep properly as I am a side sleeper. Emirates makes a big deal about lie-flat beds but does not deliver in all of their business class cabins.";POSITIVE

I couldn't update my many friends about the situation. Took another flight next day which was delayed more than two hours in Maldives. Staff denied to enter in Dubai on our schedule fight stating they don't have seat available and overbooked despite we were holding boarding pass. After raise complaint to duty manager he adjusted on same flight which was also delayed for two hours. Till today 29th August 18.15 pm UK time we haven't received our two luggages.

Crew were very friendly and helpful. Transit in Dubai was very smooth though we landed at peak time in Dubai. We were given meal vouchers as our transit time was more than 4 hours. Would recommend.";POSITIVE

This trip the crew disappointed me as they were talking about some new rule of not serving me a drink from the bar till they take off which is unheard of. Also past few trips on Emirates they always have shortfall of water bottles even after 3 hours of take off and their food choices have gone so commercial and reminds me of cheap United Airlines food - specially the light bite and they should stop serving this uncooked doughy pizza. The flight manager never showed up in the cabin, usually they always come and greet their Gold and Platinum members.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-28;" | Birmingham to Colombo via Dubai with Emirates. Poor throughout, specially onboard food and service which is what I thought Emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit cross-legged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to non-existent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights, Dubai to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham, we had the smaller and older aircraft B777-300. This was noticably older, dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a non-functioning screen and an hour later, nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end, I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23, they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham, after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane, apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast, no drinks runs to even offer people water. On walking around, I saw all the service staff at the back of the plane with tea and biscuits having a good old jolly. Overall, a very disappointing experience, completely unexpected from an airline with the reputation of Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-08-26;"Milan Malpensa to New York JFK with Emirates. The A380 is a beautiful plane, and the version that Emirates has outfitted is a little to flashy for my taste, fake wood and gold trim. The seats are great, lie flat with direct aisle access, the ICE inflight entertainment has a mind boggling array of movies and shows from every corner of the planet. Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish. The free limo service home is awesome. Also the agent at the lounge at Malpensa was really great, made sure we were checked in, confirmed the limo in New York.";POSITIVE

The transfer arrangements at Dubai airport were well organised and everything ran smoothly. I will be using this airline as much as I can in the future.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-25;"Flew Emirates from Colombo to Hamburg via Dubai. Nice flight, super meals and kind crew. Both flights were on time, and even though we had to wait over night in Dubai, we got enough meal vouchers so we did not have to pay for food both at night and in the morning, in the Airport. Emirates ICE movie system works very well, I have never tried anything as good on competing airlines. Only problem was in Colombo airport, where there where only two people at the check-in, so it took some time to get through.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-24;" |  Flew Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires with Emirates. At Rio International Airport Emirates use the Gol Lounge. This is a simple lounge with no frills. The food and drinks were poor and the seating not very good. The Emirates ground staff kept Business and First class passengers queuing at the boarding gate for some time while some ""priority"" economy passengers boarded - I have never seen this before. Even when allowed to board the problem was that economy passengers had to come through the Business Class cabin, so stowing hand luggage etc. became a problem as to do so meant blocking the aisles while these passengers were trying to get past. The aircraft had a very tired feel and look. The seat layout in the Business Class cabin was 2-3-2 which made leaving your seat if you were not on the aisle a problem. The cabin staff were good and efficient. The food was possibly the worst I have ever had on any Business Class flight. Although there was supposedly Wi-Fi available I was never able to connect to it. I didn't really use the in-flight entertainment much but it was a little awkward and fiddly with a strange ""tablet"" type control which didn't seem to control anything.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-08-24;" |  Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Dubai. Our flight took off and about about 2 or 3 hours into the flight the captain of our flight announced that our flight had been turned back to Johannesburg due to a problem at Dubai airport. No further announcements were made. On arrival back in Johannesburg we disembarked the plane and waited approximately 2 hours to receive our luggage, after which we were ushered to a bus taking us to a hotel where we would spend the night. Bearing in mind that our hotel arrangements were in place when landed back in Johannesburg, this could have been communicated to passengers over the PA system or by Emirates ground crew. We were not given any update as to what would happen to our connections.  We were shuttled back to the airport at 2am, boarding commenced at 3am and we took off again at 5 am. At no point were we given any indication of what would happen to our connections. When we arrived in Dubai (around 3:30pm) we were greeted with the chaos that was Dubai Airport, and then spent 11 hours waiting to be assigned new connecting flights. I was eventually given a connecting flight to Hong Kong 2 days later and put on standby for a flight leaving 3am on 5 August.  Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications. Passengers on flights that arrived an hour or 2 after hours sailed through to their connecting flights as is customary because they had been issued with connecting boarding passes at their departing airports. They also lost my luggage for the duration of my trip!";NEGATIVE

emirates;2016-08-14;" |  To me, Emirates A380 has one of the best business class seats in the industry. However the food and service can be unpredictable. On this early early morning flight from Dubai to Bangkok we had only breakfast served - ordered the egg dish - which was horrible. The sevice was also slightly arrogant. Shame, for most of the time we fly Emirates, it's a superb flight. But on this one some elements didn't come together. I wish EK was more consistent in their experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-12;"London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai flying with Emirates in economy class. There was a long line at check in at LHR Terminal 3. Security was smooth, though. There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite. At Dhaka our baggage took at least two hours to come even though in the domestic terminal we had another flight with a different airline 2 and a half hours after landing. We have a return flight back the same way with Emirates in August, hope the next one is better than this one.";POSITIVE

I was lucky to grab the bulkhead seat so had a huge amount of space in front of my legs. Flight departed on time and breakfast was served as choice of cheese omelette or Arabic option. I chose the former and was not disappointed at all. For once the service was very good without any crew attitude issues as has been seen so often with Emirates. There was free wifi as well. We landed on time and disembarkation for this huge plane was done smoothly without any air-bridges in miserable Jeddah airport.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-09;" | The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home. A journey memorable for all the wrong reasons.";NEGATIVE

Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin's seat cannot be reclined, so we weren't able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It's a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what's happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just ""in a few minutes"". What the heck, you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila. We're supposed to be back to work by tomorrow. Please give fair treatment to all your passengers. The reason for delays must be explained. ";NEGATIVE

Very pleasant and efficient crew who served meals fast. Emirates did not have any women's amenity kits onboard, so I received a men's one. Some of the passengers in middle rows had seats that were malfunctioning and would not recline, I felt very sorry for them, at the start of a 14.5 hour flight when you've paid a lot of extra dollars for a lie flat seat, that isn't very good. Our previous flight which was shorter had the same issues with seats. Business class was full on this flight, so no way to move seats. Seats are comfy enough with the mattress topper but a little on the short side for me. Much room is devoted to the minibar at the side of your seat, I would rather have a wider seat, the drinks are not chilled either, so I just got chilled drinks / water from the bar. Good selection of movies and TV shows etc. The bar was fabulous, I woke up early (3am) and had a coffee. Could not fault the attentive and very helpful staff, any problems were due to lack of maintenance of seats and ground crew not loading amenity kits.";POSITIVE

Hungry and thirsty we entered the plane. The personnel aboard seemed very reluctant and after calling the stewardess to ask for some water they just did not come.

Emirates is still one of the few airlines to offer a courtesy chauffeur service at selected airports, this is a huge cost saving and always appreciated. The moment you board the plane, you get the feeling that your custom is valued, that every effort will be made to make your journey as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The seats are spacious and luxurious. The choice of beverages superb, the bar at the back of the cabin an excellent escape, and great opportunity to socialise with other passengers and cabin crew. The dining option was a decent choice, and as good as you'd expect if you were dining out.

There were real problems and long lines boarding the A380 in Manchester and this was not well handled. The food when we got it was cold and a 7 hour flight only provided one meal? The paying passengers seemed to be a inconvenience to the cabin staff - very slow and poor service and they never smiled or interacted. You press the call bell and wait and wait and wait. Then get out of your seat and go and find them. This is not the sort of service I expected and if this had of been my first flight with them I would never have used them again. I have been flying with them and other airlines for 20 years. I shall be using them in the future as I have never had a problem like this before but would not again fly in a A380 from Manchester.";NEGATIVE

I asked if any first class seats were available as I cannot bend my knee. I was told both business and first class were full. This was not the case, after arguing my case with a member of airport staff, I was given a business class seat and it's occupant was bumped up to first class! I cannot believe I was lied to and that given that Emirates had sold my ticket to someone else they did not just offer me the first class seat. Instead leaving me upset and distressed in the airport. Since then they have lost my luggage. $6,900 was paid for my flights. Emirates, what are you playing at?";NEGATIVE

Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. Other airlines like SQ are more flexible on such requests. No food served for babies even if you ask. Lastly, difficult to get help when asking assistance with my baby's milk.

Instead of clearing the issue with Qantas themselves, I had to go and talk to Qantas and forward Qantas message to Emirates, because according to Emirates (expressed in pretty arrogant way) I booked the ticket with Qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. For me as a customer it does not make sense, as I would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport, a couple of hours before the departure. Once the issue was resolved, the seat I originally booked, was also changed (from aisle to the window).

Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only – the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations. I understand the airlines has not anything legally wrong, but otherwise did not find any redeeming feature in Airlines handling of the issue, let alone appreciation of the inconvenience caused.";NEGATIVE

I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv. That, however, is not enough to convince me to fly on Emirates with my own money again, particularly as I paid a 25% premium to fly on Emirates this time. Very disappointed.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-08-04;"Dublin to Manila via Dubai. As a frequent flyer on this route but typically with Etihad, I was booked with Emirates by a colleague who heard good things about the airline. Unfortunately this proved to not be my experience. When you fly long haul as often as I do the one thing that really matters is the seat - that's what I'm paying for. I don't believe I have experienced a more uncomfortable seat ever. Not flatbed but angled - no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep. Unfortunately I get to enjoy it all again on the return trip in 10 days. The food was pretty awful also. Firmly back to Etihad for me and my team in future.";NEGATIVE

Straight to the LHR EK Lounge which was very well serviced and enjoyed very good pre-boarding dinner for what was the last evening departure to DXB. Boarding direct from lounge a real bonus with EK. A380 full as ever, but enjoyed a couple of hours at the bar before grabbing some good rest. Arrival at DXB gate delayed due to a ground issue, but crew kept us informed. DXB can prove a little tiresome as its so big. An hour in the lounge allowed a chance to grab some breakfast and a shower before boarding for CPT. Good seat in row 7 of the small front Business Cabin in 773ER. Enjoyed excellent service from the crew all the way down to CPT. great food, great wine, very good seat and IFE. On time arrival in CPT and bags quickly delivered to belt. For the fare, EK is hard to beat in Business Class.";POSITIVE

This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home. An outstanding flight experience and actually good value for money, considering the reasonable price paid. Highly recommended.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-08-03;" |  Manchester to Dubai in Business Class. An excellent experience from start to finish. Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down. Outstanding business class experience in all aspects.";POSITIVE

Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted, nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side, The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served, I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates. only one chocolate between us! The bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink, at least you get one there eventually. The pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in Manchester bang on time. Much prefer the A340 or Boeing 777 to this plane. We have the same trip booked later this year and I am wondering if I can change to another flight to avoid the A380.";POSITIVE

Seats were a little bit hard, seemed to have little padding on the cushion. Legroom was OK but I could not get really comfortable in the seat. One major annoyance was the removable tablet on the seat frame which got in the way of my left arm and which restricted movement. The food service was good but the wine list is restricted when compared to Qatar Airways. The inflight entertainment was good but a bit fiddly to operate. Cabin crew were generally good and plane was clean and tidy. Overall a good flight but not as good as I was expecting.";POSITIVE

Chinese-speaking FA treat the customer poorly, ignored customer needs. Could only tell customer need to English speaking FA.

emirates;2016-07-25;" |  Paris CDG to Cape Town return via Dubai.  Paris CDG - Dubai leg operated by an A380 and Dubai - Cape Town leg by Boeing 777-300ER. both airplane types were new, clean, and excellent overall. This was a very nice experience, cabin crew was friendly, and we had stars in the ceiling at night. Food was delicious and came in more than fair portion sizes, I think it reminded me of Turkish Airlines which provides very tasty and large portions of food as well. I was even offered a 12-year old single malt Scotch upon asking (I flew economy class). There are lots of movies to watch in a fairly big display, seats are comfortable and spacious, and some amenities are provided in the long haul legs (eg. toothbrush/toothpaste, night mask, and socks perhaps, I do not remember). They gave away hot towels pretty often, in the return leg from Dubai to Paris CDG they gave a hot towel 3 or 4 tiles, which was very welcome. I do not think I have ever had a better long-haul economy class experience. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-07-24;" |  Flying Emirates from Christchurch to Sydney in Business Class. EK operates a Boeing 777-300 on this route. The seat configuration in this aircraft is 2-3-2 which I personally think was quite strange since many airlines around the world have installed 1-2-1 arrangement in business class for large airplane types. The seats recline to almost 180 degree flat which are quite comfortable. The stewardesses were more hospitable compared to their male compatriot. When I asked for some more water to be filled up in my empty glass, he kept showing me the already provided bottle of water. Before landing all business class passengers were given express cards for being used at the immigration counters. All in all we were quite happy flying with Emirates.";POSITIVE

Food for such an airline miserable, with totally tasteless shrimps, and no fantasy in the menu at all. Seat not very comfortable: because of the removable screen controller, less space for elbow. Interesting also to note that all Emirates pictures show business class cabins in 2-2-2 configuration, never in 2-3-2.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-07-23;" |  Bangkok to Newcastle via Dubai with Emirates. This is business class on an industrial scale - literally. Onboard the service feels entirely scripted lacking any sense of personality or personalisation. The business class lounge in Dubai is akin to warehousing premium passengers - a cavernous space with no redeeming features. There was nothing good about this experience. And a queue of 10 for the rest room in a supposed premium lounge area? Really? This is not a premium experience, period. Thankfully I only to have to endure EK on a bi-annual basis. I'm so pleased to be able to reacquaint myself with ANA and Singapore Airlines as my regular flying partners.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-07-21;" |  Child Escorted service. I am so angry at Emirates. Paid for escorted service on London to Perth via Dubai route, that gives priority baggage only to have the luggage go astray. If this is how Emirates are with under 18's travelling alone and supposedly looked after, it makes you think what service you get for your payment. Now our little one has had to go shopping while very tired to get the basics. Come on Emirates, get into gear.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-07-19;" |  Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. These were our first Emirates flights. Excellent cabin crew, friendly, attentive and happy to engage with the passengers. Both aircraft were very comfortable, but we prefer the extra smoothness and comfort of the A380. For a couple we recommend the central pair of seats which are positioned together with the mini bar section between the seats and the aisle. The wine selection was excellent and food very tasty and of a high standard. Regular supplies of hot towel throughout the two seven hour flights. The only negative was that I struggled to get the wifi set up, but that is probably down to my ineptitude. I could have requested help there but I didn't as I was into a film at that point. The Emirates lounge at Manchester was very good and is soon to be updated we were told. We were very impressed with the food in all the lounges we used, the KUL lounge was excellent too. There very good quality wines, coffee etc on offer in each lounge. Prior to these Emirates flights our most recent business class flights were from LHR terminal 5 and BA, Emirates offering is many levels higher than our experience there. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-07-19;" |  Emirates just won my worst airline experience. I was supposed to fly the simple Manila-Dubai-Washington route. But instead, I got Manila-Clark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. We then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. Eventually, we left at 2AM after a 8 hour delay. Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made. Those that ticketed me in Clark airport in the Philippines was not even an Emirates staff.

The Entertainment options were exceptional. I guess Emirates takes a lot of pride in this. I managed to watch local Indian TV interviews and I managed to catch a glimpse at my Nigerian neigbour who seemed to be watching something local too. So, a wide diversity and variety of IFE. I ordered a Vegetarian Oriental Meal which was just okay. I was expecting something more flavourful. I'd ordered the same on the DXB-BOM leg, but they chose to give me the standard vegetarian option (Paneer lababdar, I think) already available and I was thankful. Both very comfortable flights. The journey back to FRA was even more so. There was WiFi on the flight (so I could literally make a call over Whatsapp from my flight which somehow didn't work at the Mumbai airport). The Jain Meal (BOM-DXB) was excellent and the Asian Vegetarian Meal (DXB-FRA) was okay. I still have memory of the snack (muffin) they provided later - it was that good. I was impressed by how good Emirates is in terms of room space, food, staff, everything. Oh, the views for the morning flight from DXB-FRA over Iran, I think, were simply stunning - white, snow-capped mountains.";POSITIVE

I left DUB on the late evening flight, supposed to leave at 22.25 but was delayed by 30mins or so because of an off load. Getting to the airport and similarly, on return, the chauffeur pick up worked extremely efficiently. Emirates is still, unfortunately, using the the DAA lounge in DUB. I had hoped, 2 years ago, that when they went to 2 flights per day, they would have their own lounge, like Etihad, but we can still hope. The DAA lounge is extremely basic, with no added frills. I flew in First with Emirates, DUB/DXB/BNE. Then transferring to Qantas Business for the Domestic connection to TSV. Out of DUB, it was very lumpy for the first 3 hours, to the degree that all the cabin crew had to be seated, so I didn't manage to get my evening meal until around 1.30am, by my clock. The 4 flights I had with Emirates in First Class, were all of a very good standard. Comfortable, good service and good food / wines. When I go back to Australia, Emirates First will certainly will have to be considered, if I can still afford it.";POSITIVE

There are a lot of food and dining options that you can pre-select and I did try to select some vegetarian food. The overall food experience on flight was great. The soup and entree was nice but the main was probably left in the oven for longer time leaving the rice very hard and the the green beans a bit burnt. Apart from this down side, the entire experience was truly amazing.

emirates;2016-07-12;"Difficult to fault, although I felt the cabin crew on the Delhi - Dubai (777-300ER) flight had an edge to them, attentive as soon as you board, called you by your name, introduce themselves and have a chat. Very welcoming. The upper deck of the A380 has so many cabin crew, they say hello as your go to your seat but then stand around for a long time before fully engaging, they seem to engage with each other more than the passengers. This is only an observation, but I have noticed it on a previous flight as well. Catering was very good from Delhi - Dubai, very good Indian meal, and Arab Mezze, lots of drinks offered and a beautiful Mango Mousse for desert. Cannot fault ICE the Emirates in flight entertainment system, its got an absolutely monster choice of movies / albums, more than enough, it took me ages to choose my movie as the selection was so good. Catering from Dubai to London, was OK, some sandwiches after take off which was early morning, were not particularly fresh, where as if you go back to the bar area the food there looked a lot more enticing (and fresh). I asked to borrow a pen, 5 times from the cabin crew to fill out my breakfast form, eventually had to go back to the bar to borrow one from the bar tender. Breakfast was good, and served just before landing at Gatwick. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft and just seems to float, little turbulence was felt, and the cabin / seats were superb. Strangely given the choice I would take the Boeing 777-300ER purely because the crew seem to be more on the ball, but overall the Emirates experience was very very good. Landing at Gatwick means quite a walk over the large bridge to get to the main terminal, assume due to the assigned parking areas for the A380. Bag was lost on arrival, no fault of Emirates, someone walked off with it by mistake, but Emirates were very helpful contacting the passenger who was on the M25 and had to bring my bag back - unbelievable.";POSITIVE

New planes and the expected Emirates service/experience. 2nd leg from Dubai to Tunis left a lot to be desired - on a very tired, old 'workhorse' 777. Narrow width seats. Old generation ICE, no working power supply (at the time). 2hrs in Tunis - you are not allowed to disembark the aircraft and for the first hour are vigorously encouraged to remain in your seat while headcounts, security formalities are completed. Having just endured a 6-hr flight and probably a couple of hours in Dubai before the flight - and in need of a stretch, drink and to freshen up - it was frustrating not to receive better on-ground 'transit' care. Delayed outbound from DXB - TUN meant the flight took close to 20hrs all in all.";POSITIVE

Food was OK, I ordered the seafood meal. Flight attendants were attentive to passengers needs. There were fruits, juices, chocolates, water at the back in between the meal service. The small pouch that contained the toothbrush etc was nice. Adequate number of restrooms, almost always no queue to use. Did not have to wait long for baggage in YYZ. My wife asked for a motion sickness pill on the YYZ to DXB leg of the trip (EK 242, YYZ-DXB, 13 Jun 2016). Flight attendant politely advised there was none on the plane and asked if another pill would do - gesture well appreciated. Wasn't able to use the wifi.

There is a wide range of movies, TV shows and music in different languages. Even the latest movies are available.

This was our first business class trip with Emirates rather than Qatar Airways, who we normally choose. A catalogue of problems, beginning with the chauffeur being an hour late to collect us, leaving us with a really stressful Friday afternoon journey around the M25 to cope with. We made it, but not by much. Seats on the A380 are great, but we were prevented from using toilets closest to us (reserved for 1st class we found out) and having to go to the back of the Business cabin to use an inadequate number of dirty toilets for what turns out to be a huge cabin. Food was mediocre. dried out (overheated) bread rolls and over-cooked dinners for both my husband and I. Staff are super though, that's their strength for sure. Arrived DXB, long bus ride to terminal (almost 15 minutes), very long walk and another change of terminals to find the next gate. Boeing 777 was really outdated. if you are not travelling with a partner, get ready for a stranger to climb over your not-very-flat bed to reach the aisle. Not acceptable in today's business class choices. TV screens are huge but the pixels make for grainy viewing and both my husband and I experienced our screens reverting to a puff-piece on Dubai and Emirates quite a few times when we were enjoying a movie. We could not connect to onboard wifi. Emirates lounge in DXB over-crowded with totally inadequate, smelly toilet facilities and queues at all times in both the men's and ladies loos. Emirates were cheaper than Qatar Airways but the choice for us will be to spend more to achieve the really high standard of care Qatar gets right. We still have out last leg to go to LHR and hoping for a meal which is not cooked to death and a taxi which shows up. Never again. ";NEGATIVE

Went up to the business lounge - lots of comfortable seating and delicious food and drink available. Went straight to airplane from lounge. My seat was at the back of the section. There was a male passenger in the seat over the aisle and I must admit I felt very exposed and too close to him. Luckily there were several empty seats so I moved to a window seat - this time seat over aisle was unoccupied. Seat was very easy to move and very comfortable. Later I was offered a mattress but didn't need it. Staff very pleasant and helpful although during the flight I did ask for a drink of hot water which I never received. Meal served on white cloth. China by Royal Doulton. It felt lovely to drink out of a porcelain mug. Food was ok - better than Economy of course. I was able to have my choice but I think I chose wrongly. Later I had afternoon tea - bread had dried out but fillings very pleasant - much better than economy's which are sometimes inedible. Nice big screen to watch. I visited the bar area which was fun.

Catering has recently improved, quality of the FAs is still erratic, but Emirates find it increasingly difficult to depart on time, both in AMS and DXB. When departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catch-up during the flight as the sector is not long enough. Turnaround time in Amsterdam is very short, and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed. Not sure why leaving Dubai on time is so difficult, but according to announcements made by cabin staff it is often due to passengers arriving late at the gate.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-06-07;"Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Outstanding. Comments apply both ways. First time on an A380 and also first in Emirates business class. Normally fly with BA but for various reasons decided to give Emirates a go and very glad I did. Speedy check-in and straight into a very quiet and large lounge at LHR T3 with excellent food and beverage. Boarding straight from lounge onto top deck of A380. Had 3 aisle seats for the family, noticeable that Emirates have narrowed the aisle to allow for the wider seating arrangements. Very nice to have a near private seat and no neighbour, nice touch having the soft drink mini bar at each seat, and lots of good accessible storage. Seat took a little getting used to, I prefer being able to put my feet on the floor rather than on a foot rest and when lying flat out the shape of the seat in front encroaches where your legs go so means for taller people you have to adjust your position in the seat to be comfortable. The food was excellent, best I have had on board in 20 plus years and the crew were friendly and worked hard (I had slight concerns before flying as reputation is Emirates can be a bit hit and miss). Nice touch was the barman taking souvenir photos on request for passengers at the bar in an old style 60s technology Polaroid type camera - quite exciting for my daughter seeing a picture appear. And yes, being able to walk down to the bar makes for a good experience. Entertainment system and screen excellent. Phone can be used, wifi slow but ok for basic browsing. Large accessible toilets that were kept spotless for the entire flight. Fast tracked though immigration and priority luggage turned up first and escorted straight to the waiting limo. Overall this trip was on a different level to any I have had for many years, I will certainly now use Emirates as carrier of choice where possible if this is the normal standard.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-06-07;"Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. Dubai won't allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. This I found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough I needed the liquid. I tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. Never before have I pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. Hardly enough to keep well hydrated. When disembarking I spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy I could have used, had I been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me - the perils of the window seat. I will try another airline for my next trip. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-06-06;"Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. It was disappointing - paid to upgrade to business class and maybe expected too much. After queuing for check in we were immediately welcomed by the staff saying ""You are on a saver business ticket so you can't use the lounge"". Yes we knew that, but thankyou for making us feel so welcome. Onboard we settled into row 18 in the lovely A380 seats. The cabin supervisor was coming through welcoming people onboard - she clearly missed us out and carried on. No smile or hello. We hadn't paid enough, obviously. Next my husbands seat did not recline or indeed move. The centre partition was jammed half way down. The cabin supervisor came over and shrugged. We will reset the seat and see what happens - it got stuck half way to lie flat. We changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy men's pub area (inflight bar). If you want a peaceful flight don't sit in the rear section. It's like lying down at a party. The food service started - they took our orders early on but oh dear, our choices weren't available. No apology even though they would have known that already at time of taking the order. The food we got was lovely but really - back row problem in any class obviously. After being at the party a while, listening to some loud stories and eating something we didn't really want we found yet 2 more individual seats further down the cabin to try and sleep. It was shoddy the whole trip. Downstairs it was half full and people no doubt had 3 seats each anyway. We upgraded not for the food but to lie down and be more comfortable. I guess we got that bit eventually but at a price we personally wouldn't pay for in the future.";NEGATIVE

Increased checked baggage allowance, now 2 x 23 kg, was great. Check in online very easy with free seat selection. NB: if you require a visa for the country you are traveling too, you can still check in on line but will not be able to print your boarding pass as the check in counter must first verify your visa.";POSITIVE

They could have worked that out hours before as I was unable to eat the other selections. They said they would write it up to ensure it didn't happen again on the next flight but the next flight knew nothing about it. So the eat anytime wasn't true, nor was their resolution. The travel instructions for the business class driver showed the wrong address on his chit in Dubai. It was not the address we provided. Obviously we got lost. The lounges were very ordinary.

The snacks that came along with the food were good. There is also free 10MB wifi which was good enough for me to send a text. Generally, I enjoyed my first time flying with Emirates. Not to forget, the cost of the tickets was reasonable. Kuala Lumpur - Dubai - Casablanca and return for approximately 500 Euros, which is not bad at all.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-05-29; |  Bangkok - Hong Kong. Greeted with indignance at Bangkok Lounge which was my very first impression of Emirates having flown Singapore and Qatar many times. Comfortable lounge. On board brand new A380-800 was comfortable with all the latest gadgets. Food ok and wine list a credit to the selectors except for Champagne. Why would you choose such a large House as Moet which seems totally out of balance with the rest of the wine selections? Friendly service although not as professional as Singapore and Qatar. HKG-BKK on an older A380 was a real experience. Seats feel more cramped than the new version although I have read they are the same width. Nowhere to put your arms when reclining and it feels like a very cramped space. Food was downright awful and service was staff who in their attempt to be over friendly and hip just got it wrong. I would much pefer to pay the extra money for Singapore and Qatar where I am almost guaranteed of a better experience. Upon disembarkation the staff were very rude. They forgot to give me my arrival papers on board. ;NEGATIVE

Unhelpful Emirates Staff at Heathrow - could barely muster a smile. Completely oversold their family friendly service. It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way. They are clearly more important than you. The toilets were not maintained. I have always flown with Virgin in the past and will continue to do so in the future.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-05-24;"EK208 from New York JFK to Dubai on May 18. Check-in lines were slow and the agent that checked us in acted like he wanted to be anywhere but there. Boarding was late and done by Zone numbers on boarding passes. The agents were strict about it and I like that - board when it's your zone and not just push and shove. Friendly flight attendants throughout the flight except one attendant who was stoic and robotic. All the others were smiles and happy to get water or snacks. Smooth take off and delicious meal (and plenty of it) was served within 90 minutes of take off. Tons of movie/TV options on ICE - but wifi wasn't working. No big deal but Emirates touts it so much it was a bit of a bummer. Screaming kids throughout the flight - not EK fault but they put the families with children in the first 2 sections of economy so if you want quiet sit in the last 2 sections. Pizza snack provided mid-flight, and in the galley fresh fruit, drinks and snacks available throughout flight. Landing in Dubai around 1pm they provided a breakfast which was good but better if it had been a lunch due to the time. One thing - the seat is ok at first but after 10 hours your bottom will be sore. Bring your own pillow or cushion and save yourself some pain. Smooth landing and short taxi to Terminal 3, but sat on the plane an extra 20 minutes as gate agents had some issue with electrical connection to the plane for the APU. Off the plane and quickly through immigration, but bags took a bit of time coming. Overall a good flight and for the price ($800 round-trip) worth the value.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-05-17;"Barcelona to Dubai with Emirates. Barcelona is one of the most passenger friendly airports we have ever flown through. From arrival to departure everthing to negotiate is very easy and it is for sure one of most favourite airports. However, the business class lounge is really in the dark ages. The food offering is really just appalling. Yesterday, there were 3 bowls of crisps, tortillas chips and bread bits. Sandwiches which had no butter, and just a piece of meat shoved in between. On another tray with a sign that says no pork, there is another tray of small rolls with cheese and stuff etc. It was lunch time when we went in and I was hungry having had a 4 hour journey to get to the airport. A tray of danish pasties appeared from the kitchen, at lunch time. On another counter there were plastic bowls of pasta salad. Just pasta with a dollop of cesar dressing. Getting on wifi is a huge mission. This is not in anyway shape or form Emirates standard of lounge and really needs to be addressed. Business and First class fares are not cheap and we have come to expect better than what is offered in Barcelona Airport.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-05-12;"Good trip with Emirates from Bangkok to Hong Kong on A380 which is a great plane. Great entertainment system. The meal service appeared disjointed but this is because they have 2 sections of service on the upper deck which is not consistent and gets confused - often you hear ""my colleague will be back with this or that"" but it never appears. The staff are individually very good though and the bar service onboard is great.";POSITIVE

I think the Premium cabins are too big for the staff to handle. They have devised some scheme of serving meals but are very confused about it. It ends up with the second line of means not being served consistently like the first. That is wine not served till food is done, etc. This actually needs managing and maybe a different approach. Otherwise, entertainment system is good, fascinating and will provide hours of pleasure. I noted that meal service has been cut on the sectors.

Over the last 3-4 years their inflight service can be best described as indifferent, this is especially true of the younger set of flight stewards. At Dubai airport the Emirates ground staff service is abysmal, it has been that way for a long time, even the food in the business lounge can be best described as average. The inflight service has been going downhill. Service it seems mainly depends mainly on individual personalities rather than as mantra. I used to complain before but no longer.

Food was OK, though concerned that the quality has somewhat changed as opposed to previous flights with the airline. Some meals were nice, though could have been better in some aspects. The WiFi service is ad-hoc and did not always work properly. This could be explained by virtue of the fact that there are Internet restrictions when flying over certain countries. No complaints otherwise.";POSITIVE

The B777-300 looked a bit tired compared to the B777-300ER, seat pitch seemed tighter, the entertainment screen was cracked and did not fully respond, the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late. When I complimented the purser on the staff performance she invited me to their area at the rear to repeat my comments ""because I want them all to hear your compliments"" and gave me a couple of Drambuies to take home as a souvenir. There can be no better way to fly economy than this although try to get the B777-300ER and possibly bring your own noise cancelling headset.";POSITIVE

Take off and landing on time although parked away from the terminal at Dubai. The cabin crew were excellent - smart and friendly as always - to the extent that, knowing the habit of serving drinks after the food, I asked for a wine when getting seated and it was brought even before we were at cruising height. The seafood meal of chargrilled salmon was delicious and accompanied by yet another wine. After dinner coffee was accompanied by a wide range of liqueurs. Cabin staff were regularly coming through the cabin to offer drinks and to check after passenger comfort and finished with ice-cream about an hour before landing. The other thing to mention is the 'assisted passenger service' which was superb at both ends with a helper staying with you from check-in to the aircraft door and again from aircraft door to pick-up transport and then actually refusing a tip.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-05-10;" |  I was flying Emirates from Muscat to New York via Dubai, with a friend who has an Arabic last name. During boarding we were called aside at the boarding counter as his name had to undergo an additional security clearance. We were the first ones to commence the boarding procedure, but after 2 hours of waiting they still had not resolved the issue. They told us the visa was OK, and that it was some kind of issue in the Emirates systems. We were not told exactly what the issue was, all we could see was that the boarding desk in Dubai was arguing with the Emirates office in JFK for the boarding release. The debate affected three travelling parties. Despite the flight already being 45 minutes delayed the JFK office refused to support the Dubai ground staff in clearing the passengers, but instead opted to open a roughly half-hour general debate with the Dubai desk on how to use the system and on the trainings they needed. This debate was held on loud-speaker. Long story, short: In the end I was told to board the plane alone or lose my flight while my friend was offloaded to take a following flight. (Curiously enough 5 minutes after Emirates closed the flight my friend was cleared, but by then it was too late to get aboard). I ended up waiting for him half a day at JFK. I found the whole incident to be quite unprofessional, and I believe the airline ground staff (especially in JFK) should collaborate more in the interest of the customer rather than power playing games with each other. This is the third incident I had with Emirates (I was once told to choose another carrier if I didn’t like flying with Emirates after they kept delaying my flights for 2 working days). ";NEGATIVE

We switched to a Boeing 777-300 in Dubai. Can't help thinking anyone in economy who was able to lie across 3 seats would have had a better trip. The Boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. This flight seemed understaffed. Too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean. The focus seemed to be on serving those who wanted alcohol throughout the flight rather than basic quality care to everyone. Definitely not value for money - at best I would describe it as poor premium class.;NEGATIVE

After waiting 2 hours and only being given 50 dollars to cloth ourselves, no explanation where our baggage is or when it will arrive.

Greetings at the door. I like seat 16K, mini bar is aisle side giving you well defined privacy, plenty of storage in the stowage below the two windows. The décor, some say bling, suits me. 15 inch screen, with separate tablet, so watch a movie and monitor the flight at the same time. Business class seats have aisle access. Served pre departure drink, with a drinks menu if required. Amenity kits are handed out on night flights, Bvlgary fragrances. On this leg, I elected to forego onboard meal and sleep, and the crew woke me for a meal. 4 hrs sleep and headed to the rear bar area which was buzzing.  Food is plentiful in finger picking style. Hennessey XO brandy and other branded spirits. The crew make flying fun. After arriving into Dubai, the lounge is the same, good food and drinks, lift to the boarding gate.

She took time to chat to the passengers - even though the flight was full, kept us topped up with drinks, snacks and meals and even took our photograph, it made the flight fun and go quickly. The plane was clean and although not one of the newest, comfortable and everything worked. On the second leg we were on a new A380, again the staff were friendly and responsive but we slept most of the way. The seats were comfortable and the plane was clean and the food tasty and plentiful. We did the same journey but obviously the other way around on our return to the UK, all fine although a bumpy flight but the staff were not as friendly and it did jade the experience.

My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma, or a nightmare I can't get over, with them misplacing my luggage - on both flights - back to back and then in Bangkok it wasn't delivered until I had to leave the country, when I got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong, they misplaced it (""erroneously"" according to the response of the customer service staff) only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also, their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. I'd never recommend Hong Kong at all, since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them, it is outsourced to an agency (Jardine services) who don't speak English properly. Their A380 planes not having a proper recliner seat for many passengers even despite being an 8.5 hour flight.";NEGATIVE

I did stop for a couple of years when they went really bad in almost every aspect, but lately they have picked up on service and everything. On my recent flight though there were many things not right again. The service with Emirates is hit and miss. You can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. On this trip I experienced both. When a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold, ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know I wanted it hot, then there is something severely wrong. Within Asia you will have good staff, within Europe you won't. The new A380 is a pleasure to fly, it is more spacious and new. The second leg of my journey was on an older model, a Boeing 777-300 and that was awful. It is impossible to move, eat, sit or do anything. My worst concern was the disgusting food.  Also my folding table was dirty, so they might want to look into cleanliness. The entertaining system is marvelous, but in the older planes many gadgets do not work properly.";POSITIVE

The seats for economy are very comfortable and for me plenty of room (I'm about 5'8). The flight attendants are friendly throughout the flight. The thing I look forward the most are the meals which are delicious. I'd recommend joining their rewards program if you use Emirates regularly as you start getting enough points to reach Silver/Gold membership. For me the benefits were, checking in can be done in a separate line or the business class counter, then when boarding members are called to board before everyone else and in Dubai you have access to the business class lounge, makes the economy flight much nicer.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-04-14;" |  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'. I don't believe they have adhered to their conditions of carriage in both instances with my cancelled flight and delayed baggage but the airline has not offered me any compensation nor apology and I am still waiting on getting my delayed luggage back from the most incompetent airline.

He scared me saying, I will be charged $150 fee for my carry on bag since I have a laptop bag also. He reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a A380. Very poor form and service. I didn't expect this from Emirates. I declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. Nobody stopped me at the gate.

emirates;2016-04-13;" |  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one. Certainly, going East-West via Dubai there's no competitor.";POSITIVE

emirates;2016-04-09;"A real tale of two halves flying with Emirates. Boarding at Birmingham was fine. Seat pitch was ok for someone who is 6'6"". Food and entertainment both acceptable. However, the service on both this leg and the Dubai to Bangkok leg was sadly lacking. Pressing the call button usually resulted in a 10-15 minute wait. The same couldn't be said for the return legs 2 weeks late where the crew couldn't have been more attentive. Couple of points of note: The A380 is a wonderful aircraft. Spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable. If you are sat towards the front downstairs there is a slight lack of overhead locker space due to the way the aircraft tapers in. It is much quieter sitting at the front compared to elsewhere in the aircraft so do try and sit in the forward cabin. Boarding was hit and miss at both DXB and BKK. Some announcements were done via the tannoy and some by the ground crew shouting out instructions. From DXB to BKK, there was a drunken passenger who kept singing and waking passengers up. The crew kept coming to speak to him but then also kept bringing him drinks. The situation could have been handled better. Now that the A380 is flying into/out of BHX, will certainly look to book with Emirates again in the future";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-04-07;" |  I stepped onboard my Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Phuket via Dubai to that lovely aroma of business class. It's not a normal thing for me to travel in business class, but it isn't a distant dream anymore. The seats appealed to me, and I loved the layout. Once I had settled in, I spotted one flaw, which was the lack of storage everywhere, but the storage available just about accommodated all my items. Once we had taken off, I sat down to what I would have described as a 'bumpy flight' coming from a nervous flyer though. However, the wide selection of movies, space available for sleep and excellent dining occupied my thoughts to more important things. There are only a couple of words to describe this cabin - beautiful, elegant and stylish. The second flight had a more tranquil atmosphere in a smaller cabin with a different design, due to an older, smaller plane. The entertainment was a little disappointing, as the response for all the channels (which were very limited) was far from instant. The dining started and ended on a slightly different tone, it couldn't disappoint. Overall I strongly recommend Emirates.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-04-06;" |  I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston. Am hoping the flight back home in two weeks are better.";NEGATIVE

I tried many times to check in and choose my seat but the system locked me out. When I made a phone call to Emirates they told me of their inability to do a thing about it. This resulted in being allocated a horrible seat in the middle, for the 13 hours long flight with the aisle person making it almost impossible for me to even go to the toilet. Topping it up the Emirates staff was unresponsive on the plane. When the staff was called they did not come even after pressing the tab 5 times. The entertainment system had so many glitches that I could hardly watch it. The worse thing was the bus from the plane to the terminal herding us like cattle.  The experience was not to end there since when I got my luggage back from the conveyor belt the lock was broken. When I sent the complaint to Emirates they said sorry for the things but passing on the blame to the respective authorities.";NEGATIVE

Our flight was expected to leave at 1415 from London Heathrow on 31st march, but departed at 1520. We expressed concerns to the staff in London and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. Onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which Gate etc the flight would be on. This left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. As we arrived in Dubai at 0100, we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays.  We chose this flight due to the short connection. If we wanted a longer layover, we would have booked it, but timing was important to us. We truly experienced a journey in a class of its own.";NEGATIVE

The new lounge at MEL impressive and elegant. Food and service of high quality. Flight from MEL departed on time. Crew good. IFE top notch, however sad to see how far south food on board Emirates have gone. Unimaginative and bland. Far worse than what other airlines serve in Economy class. Arrival into Singapore was on time. Singapore to Colombo the crew were good and IFE excellent. Food most passengers left untouched. Arrived on time into Colombo, priority bags took more than 30 minutes to come out and this is not acceptable.

emirates;2016-04-02;"Manchester to Johannesburg via Dubai. I am a big fan of the Emirates A380, quiet, comfortable and plenty of personal storage space. On the last flight out of Manchester that day I had dinner in the lounge prior to boarding and watched a movie on the 21"" screen during standing, taxi and take off before getting my bed made as soon as the seatbelt sign went out. I got about 5 hours of sleep before landing. The second leg in the 777-300 is very different. I sat in the aisle seat and my partner had the window. Unlike the A380 window and middle seats of the 2-3-2 layout need to clamber over the aisle seat to get in and out. Seats are comfortable but not full flat bed when reclined. There is a slight angle although not enough to prevent my getting to sleep. Dinner choices were nicely presented and the curry had flavour and heat, as promised by the menu. Both legs on time and bags were on the carousel soon after arrival in Johannesburg.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-04-02;" |  The large upstairs business class on the A380 is often relatively empty on the Bangkok to Hong Kong route route but on this short 2-day round trip both sectors were virtually full. Only the excellent bar at the back seemed to attract just a few passengers. The privacy in the window seats is superb, the large IFE screens make those of some airlines seem small in comparison, and a very extensive IFE programming. FAs go about their business calmly and flat bed seats are popular with some passengers who prefer to nap than partake of the meal service. With Emirates ticket prices for business class vastly cheaper than any other airline, this flight is quite literally a steal!";POSITIVE

I would still fly them again next year though.";POSITIVE

From our visit to the Emirates Lounge at Heathrow until our chauffeur dropped us off in Perth we enjoyed every minute. The cabin crew were hard working, attentive and cheerful. Food and wine was excellent and the A380 is a very comfortable plane to travel on. I have seen reports that the crew can be inattentive but I can honestly state that wasn't the case in our experience. It pains me to say, having been so loyal to BA for many years, in future our airline of choice will now be Emirates";POSITIVE

emirates;2016-03-27;" |  London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong. All in all there doesn't seem to be any benefit of flyng Emirates anymore - other carriers do this better now.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-03-25;" |  Tried Emirates for the first time from London to Melbourne via Dubai, UK having previously travelled Singapore Airlines. The difference could not be more stark. My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end. I may have been spoilt by Singapore Airlines and it may have been a one off bad experience, but serious improvement necessary.";NEGATIVE

The meal service starts very late and it takes ages for them to clear the trays. The announcements were bad and confused. Its amazing how a crew can make the difference on a flight.

The cabin crew was very nice and friendly, the seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in economy class, and the economy toilets were quite large. I had plenty of room to move around the toilets, and they had air freshener in there. The seats were comfy with lots of leg room, and the blanket they provided was quite long. When it was dark outside, they had little ""starry"" lights on the roof of the cabin to mimick the night sky. ";POSITIVE

Upon arrival at the airport it was obvious something was up, check-in row was E, queue snaked all the way to C. It took about 40 minutes for someone from Emirates to show up, in flight attendant gear, that knew what was going on (destination immigration system down, requiring manual checking of passports, etc). Some supervisors walked around looking harried, and useless. Anyway, having done online check-in again saved some time. Overall check-in would have taken more than an hour. At check-in desk I was made to take my cameras out of carry on and put camera bag in hold (12 kgs, my partner had less so we would have been within the allowance of twice 7 kgs but got ""it is for your safety"" lines, full flight etc), never had to do that. Anyway my lenses survived the trip. What was worse is that rules seemed totally inconsistent in terms of application.  Hold luggage we had no more than 2/3 of our 32 kgs each allowance. Onboard service in line with Emirates reputation, in terms of quality of seating (Boeing 777-300 with ten across) food, friendly attendants, 13 languages across them). Upon arrival in NZ very surprised with both passport control and customs/ quarantine being so friendly compared to Sydney Airport.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-03-22;"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight. Dubai Airport looks nice, but is very badly organized, and this for a new Airport! I know Emirates can be cheap, but I prefer to have a smooth journey and not to be in hurry all the time. ";NEGATIVE

More recently though I have been less than satisfied with their service levels and customer service, this has accelerated since the ""merger"" of routes with Qantas. This flight was not so pleasant - the flight was delayed from Gatwick due to an oil spill and impacted the whole journey. The inflight service was generally good, food okay, the A380 seats are in the top quartile at the price point for comfort and pitch, I was comfortable on the A380 for the whole journey despite being a tall Aussie. I even snagged some good seats near the bulkhead which made legroom no problem. The 777 segment from Dubai to Melbourne (via Malaysia) was not pleasant. The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia. Emirates have refused any form of compensation in breach of European rules and refused to supply any assistance at the journey end for this delay. The obnoxious behaviour of customer service staff makes me rethink my loyalty to this brand.";POSITIVE

No information was supplied in Bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. Once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. Arrived in Dubai and no help with connection flight. Went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight.

emirates;2016-03-12;"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome.  Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2016-03-08;"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good. A few grumbles where perhaps they could have been more adaptable but recently flew BA to Barbados and Emirates pretty much topped them in every department.";POSITIVE

Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants. We asked them in the beginning of both flights whether they could synchronize their service as much as possible, and this worked perfectly. Cabin crew were very nice and attentive. On both flights the food was plenty and of good quality.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-07;"Glasgow to Hong Kong via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 is superb, and this makes for an interesting comparison with the Boeing 777 used on the GLA sector. The latter suffers from ten-across seating in economy, which is okay for GLA-DXB flight duration, but I would resent for any sector more than eight hours or so. Otherwise, recommended. The inflight entertainment system is the best I have ever used.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-07;London Heathrow to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew were aware of it and they couldn't have been more attentive and considerate. This was based on the fact that the flight was quite empty so he said he had more time to spend with me. The food was amazing and the inflight entertainment is exceptional. On the way back it was a Qantas flight and their flight staff couldn't give a monkeys that I was terrified. As far as I'm concerned Emirates are outstanding compared to Qantas.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-07;"A quality product and service across the Tasman with Emirates from Sydney to Auckland. If you are an economy passenger on this route this is the only sensible alternative. 32-34 inches of space on a wide body jet compared to the cramped narrow bodied aircraft of QF or NZ. Service with a smile, economy meals that include extras QF did away with years ago to cut costs. Buy it with a QF flight number and you still get points, status credits and lounge access if a Club member.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-07;"Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore. I was allocated the wrong seat from check-in despite having booked it 2 months ago. I wouldn't have minded except that the new seat was near the toilets. When I inquired, it was found the seat I booked was still vacant. The ground staff at the boarding gate in Colombo were not very helpful except for one staff officer from Emirates. He was very professional and made the seat correction promptly.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-06;"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons.  However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew. Overall I was not very impressed with Emirates, their flight attendants could be more friendly and on ground crew could me more helpful. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-03-06;"Dubai to Paris with Emirates, and this time with my kids we have experienced an overbooking. At the checkin counter they told us we have no seats and have to go to another counter where they told us you have no seat, so we offer you an hotel 5 stars, dinner and breakfast (it was already midnight and the next flight scheduled at 7 am). I said I refused and they immediatly found 3 seats next each other. So problem solved quite quickly. The flight was good, the seat is comfortable. Food is good, staff is really nice.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-05;"Flight no issues, inflight entertainment was not as expected or advertised. Food was not good at all. On my flight back to SA, the only good option I had was vegetable and was told that the other options were not available as it was finished. Most of the time cabin crew had to be asked twice as they had forgotten. Just some info for passengers, if you are asleep while serving food you will be left to sleep.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-03-03;"Our flights to and from Cape Town using Emirates for the first time were in the main very good for economy class. The 777-300 ER is a fine aircraft, but as a lot of reviewers have mentioned with Emirates having a 3-4-3 seating arrangement it does make it quite cramped, and being in an aisle seat I was constantly bumped into with people moving up and down the aisle. The crews on all our flights were very good, happy and willing to serve and help the passengers. The food for economy class was very good indeed, and the individual menu was a nice touch, and there were plenty of water and juice runs throughout the flights. Compared to other airlines I've flown with, Emirates don't have a general bar service before they serve their meals, although they do offer wine, water or juice with your meal, but right behind the meal service comes the bar service which just felt odd. The ICE entertainment system was excellent, large screens, huge selection of films, TV, and music to while away your flight, and the external cameras showed you views you normally don't get to see unless you are a pilot. If Emirates changed to a 3-3-3 seating arrangement and increased the pitch too they would offer their economy passengers a fantastic service instead of a very good service.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-03;"So I finally flew with Emirates and apart from one thing it was a really nice experience. You can tell that their planes are young, seats are comfortable and ICE is really good, so many movies and you got nice headphones even in economy. Food on board was good, I liked the taste and was actually full. On my flight from Vienna to Dubai, it took almost 2 hours to serve the food and since it was a 6 hour night flight you want to sleep, however, on my second flight it was better. Price was really good, it was the second cheapest ticket I found. We had long layover in Dubai (on purpose because we wanted to see Dubai) where we were given a meal voucher for Dubai airport for a couple of restaurants which was really nice. I will definetelly fly with them again, already purchased tickets to Bali and plan other destinations this year as well.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-01;"Kuwait to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai with Emirates - a pleasant experience. I was overfed (which is a pro in my opinion), the seats were comfortable, the ICE system was amazing and helped pass the time, and overall the crew were amazing. I would definitely fly Emirates again in the future.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-01;"Chauffeur pick up worked excellently, and is a really nice touch. The lounge at Birmingham was fairly small but large enough for the number of passengers and with good food and drink. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was on an old 777, and the 777 business product isn't as good as the product on other airlines for this length flight. The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground. The chauffeur pick up worked well although could have been better organised at the airport itself as you just had to look around the busy bundle of Emirates chauffeurs trying to find your name. A central person who located your driver would make it much smoother and more professional.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-01;"Mumbai to Gatwick via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur pick up and check in/security at Mumbai went smoothly. The lounge is a shared one at Mumbai but nice and the staff excellent. Mumbai to Dubai was on an old 777 but was suitable for this length flight. The seat is comfortable and spacious, and the IFE screen of reasonable resolution and had a good selection. Food was fine. The lounge at Dubai is not a particularly good one in my opinion as it is huge and chaotic and not a particularly nice layout. I appreciate this is only business not first, but still would have preferred less of a corridor feel to it, as well as self service drinks areas dotted about. Dubai to Gatwick leg was excellent. The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration. Gatwick is awful at the moment and the queue was enormous. This as well as the ridiculous and terribly organised baggage reclaim (which clearly is not able cope with the A380) let down the whole premium experience of Emirates down.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-03-01;"Sydney to Dubai with Emirates. We were allocated the wrong seats from check-in. Ended sitting next to an inebriated passenger that made the trip the worst. Tried to change the seats before the flight but the ground staff were very rude. On return complained to airline, but not even an apology.  The customer service team is a computer. The only response I got was a computer generated letter. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-29;"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-29;"Dallas to Dubai with Emirates - amazing airline. A380 with good service, tasty food. The seat comfort was good. The cabin crew are friendly, entertainment had some good games and the latest movies to watch. The personal video screen size was good. Every 4 hours they serve a meal or snack. You can also get get free drinks any time in the flight. Every 1 hour they come along with some juice and some refreshments. Ground service was nice, little busy but overall good.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-28;"So the boarding was chaotic. Not much. The crew distributed hot towel in other section but not ours.  The ICE system had an amazing variety of movies, shows, music etc. Once in air crew immediately distributed the food and drink. Pillow and headphones with magazines and.  The serving of food just had 1 choice. Well it was fine for a short haul flight. The flight was of 1.30 hours. The food was fine not bad and drink was average. Not much variety. The landing was good. Crew were also good.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-26;We were very pleased in all respects with Emirates. The check in both in Gatwick and Dubai was swift and efficient. On board the seating was fine with plenty of leg room and the meals served were tasty. The best aspect is the in flight entertainment system which has a huge variety of films and TV and large screens to make viewing a pleasure and cameras on the plane so you can watch the take off and landing from the pilot's view. I even read my emails using on-board wifi. It's a million miles away from British Airways! I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-26;"Mumbai to Dubai and Emirates staff was very considerate. I was travelling with a active toddler. Dubai to San Francisco and the air hostess are least bothered. Not a sight of smile while welcoming. Young kids needs milk, is it not obvious or let parents carry them. Irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. In a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler. I guess cabin crew staff needs to be trained to handle young kids and learn some patience instead of making faces. This is annoying for passengers.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-25;"From the moment I checked in, Emirates managed to make a mess of things. I asked the agent at the check in counter if I could use the lounge with my One World emerald status (Platinum with Qatar Airways), given that QF and EK code share the flight I was checking in for. She took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with QF instead of QR. I didn't notice her error until I arrived at the QF lounge and was promptly denied entry. EK also switched my seat without informing me. When I asked about it at the gate, I was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. That is fine, but EK could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. Onboard, FAs did the minimum. I asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the FA completely forgot about. The best was when I asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata - exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. I was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. What? Is ketchup the new Dom Perignon? Give me a break. Requests with the call button went ignored. Last time I flew with EK was in business class from NBO-KWI via DXB. I didn't find it to be a very good experience. The final kicker is they broke a wheel of my dependable and well constructed roll on bag. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-22;"My husband and I enjoyed our outbound Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai to Bangalore. No problems there. However, on our way back I was given a seat that doesn't recline (Dubai to San Francisco) and for a 15 hour flight, my back was toast. I have a bad back.  I mentioned it to the stewardess and she tried to fix/push the button for the recliner, to no avail. She however tried to put me in another vacant seat, but I declined because I don't want to leave my husband by himself.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-22;"Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai. Different service experiences. Flight HAM-DXB (EK 60) was on time, First was fully booked. Very good service by 2 attentive FA's and the purser. Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me. I now asked for the purser and a little later I got my breakfast. The purser later came to me and apologized and told me, that he is not very happy that Emirates needs so much new staff and that today after too short a time FA's can serve in First Class. For me Emirates offers outstanding liquor and wines, the suites and showers are wonderful but it is a lucky draw, what kind of service you can expect in First class. They are growing too fast.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-20;"I easily redeemed my Emirates skywards points on the their website for a 2.5 hour return ticket from Bangkok - Hong Kong. I travelled on a brand new A380 with terrific new TV screens and new headphones with great sound. The screens are so large that the shape of the seats need to be angled to accomodate them. Check in, seat comfort, ICE entertainment, crew service and food was perfect - definately my airline of choice.";POSITIVE

Cabin staff was so welcoming and helpful, they gave lots of refreshments throughout the journey and and were very attentive. Overall we had a brilliant experience with Emirates.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-18;"Manchester to Dubai return, and I was looking forward to my first flights with Emirates. On the way out from Manchester they switched the seats I booked 3 months ago - they gave me various reasons like different aircraft - not true - and eventually they moved me nearer to the seats I had booked - why was someone else sitting in the seats I had booked? In an 8 hour flight we had one drinks service and one meal - not enough. On the flight back they switched the seats I booked 3 months earlier - sounds familiar - same excuses - again not true - after stamping my feet they gave me the seats I had already booked. Meals were great but far between, drinks were almost non existent. Not the experience I was expecting. Good legroom, good food, excellent entertainment, but poor service. Living off their reputation I think.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-16;I was flying Emirates back to Kuwait in Economy Class from Mumbai post minor surgery. There was a long queue at the online check-in counter and therefore approached the Duty Manager to facilitate expedited check-in for medical reasons. I was almost immediately guided to the Business Class counter and was through in minutes. Boarding was smooth and almost on time. Aircrafts (B777) throughout the itinerary looked tired with none having Wide Screen IFE. On Board services were good with cabin crew attentive throughout the flight. Fare was possibly the lowest in spite of last minute booking. Great value for money. Quality and services can be attributed comprehensively on request or when having an issue. Will continue to fly with Emirates as I have been for the past decade or so especially considering the courtesy extended at check-in.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-15;"Flew Dubai to Bangkok with Emirates. Second part of a long flight, seated in front cabin of economy class. Good unobtrusive service which helped the cabin stay quiet. Offered cold drinks several times and food was good. Cabin was full and space was at a premium especially in luggage bins, this may be due to people bring on two or three bags. Good entertainment on ICE service. Toilets freshened during the flight.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-15;Madrid to Dubai with Emirates. Sat in front cabin of economy row 42. One problem of this row is that because of the curve of the plane the overhead luggage compartment is smaller and normal wheeled cabin bags do not fit in them so bags have to be put further back. Reasonable leg room and very good service from stewards. As the flight was not full we were advised to go to the rear of the plane as there was lots of space there. Excellent selection of entertainment to enjoy. The front cabin is quiet. Ordered special meals and these were delivered promptly and were very good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-15;"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-14;"Phuket to Amsterdam via Dubai. A less interested crew than my outbound flights, but still efficient and friendly. On all 4 legs we arrived early. Food and beverages of great standard. Lounge in HKT not the best but you are escorted from check-in to the lounge and avoid horrendous queues at all stages of security. We arrived at a quiet time in DXB and the staff in the lounge were proactive, refilling drinks. A380 on DXB-AMS leg empty in Business Class which made the bar experience less fun but still a great trip. ";POSITIVE

emirates;2016-02-09;"London Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok with Emirates. We were not offered enough water and when we asked staff for water it was a constant battle to get any, yet they were more than happy to give the drunk man constant alcoholic drinks and encourage him. The seat wouldn't recline and TV wouldn't work.  We asked staff for support and were told they would come back yet they didn't! We paid extra and specifically chose to fly with Emirates, a decision we can never take back. A once in a lifetime holiday started off awfully. One of our meal choices was chicken or beef and after asking for two beef were told only one left - en they went to the two rows behind us and offered beef or chicken. A complaint submitted and would hear within 30 days - 29 days later we got a reply, what a joke for an award winning service.";NEGATIVE

Obviously passengers expected some breakfast after takeoff but when the breakfast arrived I did not see anyone eating it because what was served was stale.  I am surprised why even the airline bothers to serve any food on this sector if there is nobody to check on what is being served. For an  airline like Emirates I expect a better standard than other airlines. The connecting flight to Frankfurt was at 8.40 on the A380 and I was pleasantly surprised on the good service by the cabin crew, as well as good food.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-07;Emirates Amsterdam to Phuket AMS-DXB on brand new A380 just a few weeks in service and a great crew in Business Class. No Emirates lounge at AMS so took the 35 euro voucher for food and drink airside each instead of using the shared lounge. Great food and drink and early arrival with fast-track. Indeed we were in the complementary chauffeur before the STA of the flight arrival. Everything was well organised. Return chauffeur at DXB on time and another good flight to HKT on a much older 777 but again friendly crew who really wanted to be there. After some negative reviews we were concerned that Emirates had grown too fast and had deteriorated but this was not our experience and we would highly recommend.;POSITIVE
emirates;2016-02-04;"Munich to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. Slow and bad Business Class Service. The first drink on MUC-DXB and DXB-PER took ages. Don't ask for a refill - you won't get if because the cabin crew is not able and/or not willing to cope with extra requests. Particularly bad was the meal service on the DXB-PER leg. Food came without any drinks - not even water. When I used the call button a flight attendant showed up after a while and took my order. However, the order never arrived. She came back after - believe it or not - about 30 minutes and explained that thy have not been able to serve my order because ""they were busy with serving the food"". This is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in Business Class. Emirates might have a young fleet of aircraft, but their in-flight processes are a disaster and they have no service attitude. They are entirely inefficient. I can only recommend to use the Asian carriers or maybe Qatar Airways when you fly between Europe and Australia.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-02-04;"We flew Emirates from Madrid to Dubai and we were shocked that the 777-300 was configured 3-4-3 on this aircraft and not the standard 3-3-3 as usually found on other airlines who operate the type, this, along with extrememly tight seat pitch made for a very uncomfortable flight. Ground service was good, no delays, no baggage problems and the IFE is excellent. Cabin crew seemed scattered and uncoordinated, the men do the donkey work whilst most of the girls seem to have been chosen for their looks rather than their ability to do the job. Dinner was served over two hours into the flight, ie, almost midnight, reasonable grilled chicken and bean salad starter followed by a choice of roast chicken or ragout of lamb. By the time they got to us they'd run out of the lamb, hardly surprising, so we got chicken for our main course too: dry as a bone, served with some sloppy veg. Breakfast wasn't offered, not even juice, just a choice of coffee or tea. One drinks service before dinner. A huge disappointment after all the hype we'd heard about Emirates. We'll see how next week's return flight goes.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-31;"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA. I understand that the A380 fitout may be better but I'll continue to avoid Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-29;"Copenhagen to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. The seat comfort on business class A380 was astounding. The seats on the CPH to DXB flight were more modern than Dubai to Perth, but both were just as comfortable. There was no Emirates lounge in Copenhagen, an Aviators lounge which was pretty good. The cabin staff was great on both flights, as was the food. The inflight entertainment was not lagging at all. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-28;"Experienced a very smooth journey with Emirates from Auckland to London via Brisbane and Dubai. Staff were friendly and on point with customer service, excellent value for money. Entertainment range was very good. Long layover arrangements were very good. I would recommend it to anyone looking at doing a long journey. However, the only thing I couldn't make the most of was the cabin Wi-Fi because it was too slow.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-28;"Emirates have gone backwards. Accra to Dubai leg was in a Boeing 777-300er, one flight attendant had a rude attitude whilst the other was great. Unfortunately the rude one was in our cabin. The 777 business class seats are outdated and other airlines have much better seating. Food and service was below average. Dubai to Sydney in an A380, crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. I was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together, every single time my food orders were incorrect. Meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes. Meals were served and wines were poured after meals ended. Comfort wise I was able to get some sleep in the A380 seats. Overall a below average experience with Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-28;"Emirates once more offered a fantastic product, to bring me from Dubai to Frankfurt. The experience started with this unique Emirates chauffeur-Service, dropping me off at Dubai airport, just some steps away from a smooth check-in. Security and passport-control were easy and the lounge outstanding. It is huge, more like a First Class Terminal. It is important to keep in mind, that the airport is quite big, it took 15 minutes to walk from Check-in to the lounge and 15 minutes from the lounge to the gate. Boarding was well organized and efficient. This time, there was no airbridge to the upper deck, but this was not a problem, as the A380 was not fully booked. Priority boarding made it easy to get on the aircraft. Service was outstanding and the crew great, cheerful and friendly. Even when you did not have a meal at the lounge, it is nearly impossible to taste all the delices of the menu. Meal service is on demand, whenever you want it. Comfort is excellent, not only because of the shower and the seat/bed. This aircraft is so quiet! Onboard Wifi worked well during 2/3 of the flight, 500 MB for 1 USD is a fair deal. At Frankfurt, priority delivery of luggage (own belt for First an Business) worked well and with a waiting chauffeur-service, the way home was as easy as it could get. The not really cheap price was nevertheless more than ok for a high-end travel-experience with this unique bling-bling-feeling.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-27;"Melbourne to Auckland with Emirates. 30-45 minutes late in takeoff, they said it was due to cleaners, anyway eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was nice, the seats looked comfortable enough and it was certainly clean. The FA's however were conspicuous in their absence. Once boarded, we didn't see them again till we were served a meal. About an hour or so before we landed I asked one FA about landing cards to fill in. She said they had run out of them as they ""never give us enough"" and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. Not sure why this wasn't done when they had run out earlier? Anyway that was sorted. They also asked for coin donations to a children's fund, so we had our coins ready but no one came for them. Just odd. The PE was quite good though but as for service, I'd say below par compared to most airlines I have flown.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-27;"Sydney to Dublin via Dubai, and Emirates have an average to good business class product. Flew both legs on 777 with only issue being the seats are angled lie flat which was a disappointment. Food was good with large portions on both legs, good selection of wines and spirits. Excellent AVOD with the largest selection of movies I have seen on an airline. Staff on both legs were both professional and friendly. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-25;"Lusaka to Amsterdam via Dubai, the Emirates A340-300 was full and seats pretty cramped. IFE the old type and with the seat of the passenger reclined almost all the way it was not possible to get a good view of the screen. There was no wifi on this flight. The cabin crew seemed disinterested and more busy with themselves than with their passengers. Two crew doing the meal serving were gossiping about a colleague apparently oblivious to the fact that at least 20 pax around them where hearing this. Furthermore an extra order of something that was not on a drinks trolley was acknowledged, but never arrived. Emirates was a great airline with fantastic service but they now need to realize that on the stretch LUN / HRE to Europe there are alternatives.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-24;"Karachi to Dammam via Dubai with Emirates, and clean aircraft on both legs. Flight attendants cooperative and active. Food was served on the first leg but had only one option. Second leg was delayed due to operational reasons for 30mins, but was advised at DXB. We have 2 hours to kill at DXB. There is a play area at concourse B opposite to patisserie shop which was nice addition in our layover to get my daughter charged up again for the next leg.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-23;"On 14 January I received an email stating that my flight from Dubai to Panama (EK0251) on 3rd March had been cancelled. I was not given an explanation and I not given suggested options. I phoned the local Emirates office and spent 56 minutes on the phone to try and fix this at my own cost. We were offered a refund, but at this late notice we would not have found affordable alternatives. The first option I was given was to go via Houston and miss my connecting flight from Panama to Quito. The second option was via Sao Paulo. My original flight landed at 16:40 on 4 March. I had booked accommodation in Panama for the night of the 4th to recover from the longest flight in the world. My new flight lands at 6:49am on 5 March. I will now be spending two nights travelling including a layover from 6pm to 2am in the São Paulo airport. I was not offered any options to make this less horrible. I was not offered an upgrade on one of the legs or access to a lounge in Sao Paulo. In addition, it was only explained to me after I had agreed to this route change that the flight from Sao Paulo to Panama will be with Copa Airlines - not Emirates. As we are travelling with surfboards, this will cost us money. I wrote a complaint to Emirates and received an email stating that on cases such as these, they are unable to offer lounge access or an upgrade. We spent a lot of time choosing this as the best flight for our trip to get to Ecuador. This new route of Johannesburg, Dubai, Sao Paulo, Panama, Ecuador is not the best option.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-23;"Toronto to Dubai, and I always fly on Emirates and everything is great except the attitude of cabin crew. I have a 4 year old and we book his meal in advance - on this very last flight, my food was served and his was nowhere to be found. I talked to three different cabin staff until one finally brought the tray for him! The crew looks at you and says yes, but then they disappear so you have to ask another crew member - and if you are lucky, the third or the fourth one will finally get you what you want! It's such a shame that inflight service is mirroring so bad on the airline. Yes the flights are long and you get tired but you know this when you apply for this job. I enjoy the IFE, food is ok, seats are fine, planes are safe but my only complain is the Cabin Staff attitude and the way they treat the passengers! I hope someone from Emirates looks into this issue!";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-22;"Gatwick to Hong Kong via Dubai on Emirates. Check in and boarding at Gatwick smooth and departed on time. My pre booked seat was changed to accommodate a family but my reassigned seat was still an aisle which was my preference. The drink trolley took a long time to come around and was followed by the food trolley. Meal was braised beef which was OK, but only lukewarm. The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel. All in all, an okay experience but the crew need to sort out the trolley service a bit.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-21;"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front. Overall, very pleased with how well everything went! I look forward to flying with Emirates again very soon.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-20;"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and I arrived on New Years Day in Kuala Lumpur to discover that my wallet had fallen out of my carry on bag, and the first thing I did on entering the airport was look for it. Staff were unhelpful and the ground crew refused to let me back on the plane to check. I understand this may be policy but nothing was explained.  After waiting to no avail I went to collect my luggage, but to my horror no luggage appeared. The staff representing Emirates had no help or a kind word to offer, and could not tell me where my bags were. The best I could do was make my way to my hotel and wait. My bags turned up the following day. On my return flight, accompanied by my partner, we found that they had changed our pre-selected seats and we were not seated together. We did not notice this until we were through immigration, and then had to talk our way back through so that we could convince the check-in desk to re-seat us -  a huge waste of time. Waiting for our luggage at Melbourne airport at 2:00am it turned out they had misplaced my luggage again, as well as my partners this time. This led to more time spent at the lost baggage counter, and having to sit at home for the better part of the next day waiting for it to be delivered. All up I would say that I wasted at least 8 hours on unnecessary mistakes, not to mention the distress caused, which was certainly not alleviated by their very unhelpful staff. Inflight was all smiles and complimentary wines, but that does nothing to buy back the time and stress spent on this company.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-20;"Frankfurt to Dubai in First class, and chauffeur-service included in the fare, Emirates lounge is okay at Frankfurt but there is no extra space for First-Class-passengers, and it is before security, what you have to keep in mind when calculating the time budget. There was no priority boarding for First Class. That was the only weak part of the trip. Onboard the seat is fantastic, plenty of space and the staff was doing a great job. Meal service on demand was classy, with tasty food and great wine. The lounge in the rear was outstanding with a great ambience. The shower was perfect to get refreshed before arrival. They have Wifi available. 10MB free, 500 for 1 USD only (Credit Card). It was faster than I expected, just okay to send some pictures home. At Dubai, they have a dedicated area for chauffeur-service. It took no time to get a car for the destination.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-18;"The staff on my Emirates A380 flight from Dubai to London and the Mumbai to Dubai section of my journey were very good (and return flights). Perhaps there could be a few more of the them on the A380 - it is such a large plane which was full, so service a bit slow. Food was good for economy but the legroom on the Boeing 777 was a bit cramped. Would use them again no problem and they were great with a disabled friend, both the staff on the plane and the ground crew when moving between planes.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-18;"Dubai to Muscat with Emirates, and it was a short flight of approx. 1 hr with a wide-body A330. Unlike flights in Europe where for this flight duration you only get a drink (if at all), on this flight we were served breakfast. ";POSITIVE

Check in was slow and did not feel I was warmly greeted. Greeting on the plane was neither warm or genuine compared with Singapore Airlines. The cabin crew did not engage and would not make eye contact when walking past. Had to make up my own bed. Food was average and not the best wine selection. Overall, this was not a premium experience.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-17;"Flew Durban to Seattle via Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777s. Durban to Dubai was very bumpy almost the entire 8 hours, so cabin service was limited to a single meal and a single drink prior to that meal. Cabin crew were fine, not overly friendly but definitely not hostile. The warm towels were a nice touch. Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok. a promising chicken dish in a mustard sauce that lacked flavor when delivered but the rest of the meal was quite good. Cabin crew offered pizza a couple of hours before landing.  I was seated in a window seat on this leg which felt more crowded because I had people next to me and the guy seated in front of me reclined to the max as soon as he could and stayed that way the entire flight! IFE on this leg (ICE) was outstanding, over 1000 different selections including several Mozart channels plus a whole season of The Big Bang Theory! Plane was very full in economy. Overall, a pretty good experience for such a long ride. Booked 14 days in advance and still got what I consider to be a great price considering the distance and how full the plane was when I booked. If you're not a high-maintenance customer, Emirates value to its passengers is definitely superior to South African Airways.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-14;"Hong Kong to Glasgow via Dubai with Emirates. The bar was a highlight of the first leg of my flight. The food on Emirates lacks a certain something. Not sure what it is but the menu just doesn't seem inspiring. Beverages on the other hand are plentiful, varied and excellent. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but I feel boxed in on those seats. The one on the 777 was a pain in the butt. I wanted to do some work on the plane but my lights shone into the face of the person seated beside me on the 777. My personal reading light did not work at all. Further to this, the lounge in Dubai is not a pleasant relaxing environment. There are just too many people running around. Not great at 3am when all you want is a good rest. I ended up going down to my gate where everyone was a lot less manic and chilled out on the comfortable long loungers. The chauffeur service was excellent, my driver going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great service in Glasgow. My return flight was the contentious one. I'd chosen my seat when booking, an aisle seat because I'm very tall - when I went online to check in, I find my seat has been re-allocated without even being informed. Not an obligation on their part of course but it would be nice to know. Ended up upgrading to business rather than deal with middle seat in economy. In a rare act for one so afraid of flying as myself, I managed to focus on the entertainment for more than ten minutes without losing myself to panic. Managed to watch live football which was a great and pleasant surprise! As it goes, the one leg of economy I had, seated near the front of the bottom deck in economy was the most comfortable and best flight of my itinerary. Great seat.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-12;"Auckland to Newcastle via Dubai and I was very disappointed with the service. They had run out of food options so we only had one choice, the staff were unhelpful. My coffee fell off my tray onto my seat, I told the stewardess and she handed me five napkins and walked away. I asked her for another blanket and she never returned, so I asked another stewardess and she walked away. I thought she was coming back so I was reluctant to fall asleep, I sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. Half an hour later she didn't return so I had to ask a third member of the crew. The crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a man's foot they didn't apologise. They looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. When they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. She said ""oh"" and walked away. When another steward came to collect our towels I said I never received one and he frowned, looked around, and walked away. I wasn't spoken to again. Halfway through the flight an alarm went off and a yellow light flashed the stewardesses asked each other ""what does that mean"". I pointed to the screen by the toilets where it said ""smoke detected"". They swore and ran off and came back later to announce ""it was just someone's deodorant"".  Finally we were delayed for an hour when leaving Dubai and were not informed why or spoken to, we just watched the flight safety video and an hour later we suddenly took off. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-12;"The London-Dubai leg was great because we got an Emirates A380 and it was generally a comfortable experience with minimal bumps. The service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. The leg from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur was a whole different story. The plane felt old and gaudy. For 4 hours of a 6 hour journey, we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. Nobody could go to the bathroom too and so I spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. The passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. I was assigned seat 21H due to its accessibility to the bathroom. If anyone chooses this seat, I promise you that you would be subjected to people's butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. I've had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing.  They would grab your food trays without asking too. The attendants on the A380 were much more polite and pleasant.  Their airline ranking must have gone to their heads. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-10;"Nightmare Emirates flight from Dubai to London. We were on our 2nd leg of our journey from Sri Lanka to UK on 5th January. First the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. Then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the Captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to Dubai. After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude. Will certainly be thinking twice before booking Emirates again!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-09;"New York to Dubai. After having flown with various American airlines over the last 8 months I’m relieved to be back on Emirates. The first class on the A380 is everything it should be. Love the privacy of their suite and comfort of the seat, may it be in an upright position, lounge or as a fully flat bed with a separate mattress which is excellent for sleeping. The catering is on-demand, with an amazing selection of food. I tend to over-eat on such flights for I’m eager to try everything. And drink everything. I wasn’t disappointed. Everything I tried was top notch quality and taste. IFE is incredible with an amazing collection of movies and TV shows. And the 32-inch screen is a pleasure to watch. The piece-de-resistance is the shower that sets them apart. The surprisingly disappointing feature on this flight was their internet. Given how heavily they promote online connectivity while flying and the free (or nearly free) service, it is also a frustratingly slow experience. This is something that needs to improve. I simply gave up for the connection was so slow. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-08;"Rome to Jakarta via Dubai with Emirates, and terrible in-flight service. Was calling for a flight attendant to help pull the screen from the side of my seat and had to wait for at least 30 minutes before one showed up and that was for the inflight meal service. Then she just stared at me and did not move a muscle until I requested her to help pull out the tv screen. Without waiting for any of us to pull out our tray table, the flight attendant just distributed the lunch trays and they were on our laps. Terrible! Despite asking for an aisle seat for both legs of my journey, I got a middle seat for the second leg of my journey. The ground crew behind the counter failed to tell me that I will get a middle seat as perhaps no other aisle seats were available. Food was so-so compared to a few other airlines I have taken over the years. Overall, I was quite disappointed with my experience, which happens to be my first time with Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-07;"Durban to Birmingham via Dubai return. I have flown three times with Emirates in the past 6 months and been satisfied with the service. However, on the flight from Birmingham to Dubai on 29th December, the ICE system froze which didn't bother me very much. Coupled with that, however, was the fact that our seats could not be adjusted and we had to sleep in an almost upright position. This is not acceptable, particularly as I had paid a premium price for the flight, due to the festive season.";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-06;"Glasgow to Tokyo Narita via Dubai with Emirates, and on both legs of my trip the seat and service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, however there were a few items to mention. The first was that at Dubai we had a 25 minute bus tour of the airport complex from the gate to reach the plane flying the second leg. No real inconvenience but it felt slightly odd to be on the bus driving around for so long. The second issue was with the food that was served on the Tokyo flight. I had the oriental vegetarian meal booked and I genuinely have no idea what the main portion of my meal was. I was served an odd flavorless mush that resembled wallpaper paste which I couldn't eat, so I had to abandon it and instead have some of the pastries the cabin crew brought round with the coffee. I'd recommend using the airline but to avoid choosing my food option!";POSITIVE
emirates;2016-01-06;"I have now flown return from Perth to London Heathrow via Dubai with Emirates on two separate occasions, and each trip has been poor. My expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. I have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. The cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst I have encountered. You are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. On two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable (despite being seating fairly close to the start of service) and obtaining a drink (water not alcohol) outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. Meal quality is however pretty good. Seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight. I have only flown Emirates as Qantas does not operate its own flights out of Perth and I wish to maximize my QFF benefits by flying on a code share flight.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-06;"London to Brisbane return via Dubai with Emirates, and our journey was the worst I have had. The crew were not service oriented and were rude - we waited 2.5 hours before we were offered water or a drink. I had stewardesses telling me ""no"" and ""I am too busy"" so many times. The crew gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving on that aircraft. Do not bother complaining - they seem to have no customer service team, but an email that will give you a generated standard reply. When I did more digging and calling, they admitted that they do not have a phone number or a team that I could speak to.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-05;"Mauritius to Dusseldorf via Dubai. The advantage of Emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats, and attractive pricing for business class. The disadvantage is that you'll have an extra stop-over at Dubai. It looks like that Emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew, than the quality of their job performance. On two out of four flights on this vacation, I found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. The other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. On one flight I had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. (I am quite tall person, and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position, is not acceptable for me). When moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. Because of the quality of the customer service of Emirates, my overall rating is low. It took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues I reported. This standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. I then asked for a relevant answer on both issue, but after an month I haven't received any answer at all. Especially for business and first class passengers I would have expected a functioning customer service department.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-04;"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The service was robotic at best. The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. For a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane, not just business class.  The free WIFI was a bonus but at 10MB was hardly enough in the age of smartphones.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2016-01-03;"This was my first time flying Emirates. Comfort wise it is quite good for an economy class, seats being relatively wide. In flight entertainment was good and the screen is really large, but the headsets are extremely bad. The food is acceptable, nothing exciting. Cabin staff was efficient and friendly.

emirates;2016-01-02;"Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"". In other words you may book online but you can't rely on the confirmation received during booking but have to call the office anyway. So what is the point of having on-line bookings when the information is not valid anyway?";NEGATIVE

Departed 28 December from Durban on flight EK776 to Dubai. The area around my seat smelled of urine. My tv screen hung loosely so I could not adjust the angle plus it was sticky to the touch. Cabin staff appeared stressed and smiles were absent. I accepted that sometimes stuff happens and maybe Emirates had experienced some hiccups that evening. However when I was served with a very stale soggy chicken bun and inedible old chocolate brownie I felt most disgruntled.

The staff was impeccable at making sure I felt safe and it helped me feeling comfortable as the flight went on. One staff in particular explained noises that I may hear and let me know what they meant, gave me Emirates cards to keep me distracted, chocolates to calm the nerves and constant check-ups. The take off and landing was superb.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-23;Dubai to Jeddah in November on an A380. New plane and great staff. The seat and IFE as expected. The only problem I had was not really fault of Emirates. Boarding was not a very pleasant experience as most of the passengers were pushing each other and were somewhat loud in their communication. Same story while disembarking. In JED we had to board a bus and it took forever to get to the terminal.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-22;"This was the return sector of my trip. Check in was again hampered by business class passengers using the first class counter. The premium lane for immigration really made the airport experience easy. The lounge in Bangkok was excellent and food good, although there was no area seated for first class passengers. On board this time, again the seat was the highlight. personal bar and amenities highly appreciated. Food again was tasteless and disappointing. Cabin staff were friendly. The purser however was never seen, and as a first class passenger I expect to be made to feel a little more important to the airline especially as a frequent flyer member. I would have expected to be greeted by the purser. Announcements were mundane and without particular emphasis on polite service. In summary, my second sector in Emirates first class and all in all I must say, other than the seat which is great for long haul, a very average experience that could be so much better.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-22;"This was my first trip in Emirates first class. Check in was average, with the counter blocked by business class passengers. The lounge in Hong Kong was adequate but busy with no separate area for first class passengers. Onboard, the seat is amazing with it's own bar and an ability to close yourself in the suite. Very good. My wife was in 4K however, and that was a noisy seat with a lot of galley noise, not really first class! Food was disappointing with overcooked chicken and half of the menu items not even offered. At no time was I offered cheese or chocolates which are on the menu. The lights in the shower suites were not working and the flight attendant opened the door once when my wife was in there using the toilet. Inflight entertainment was impressive, but the remote for my seat stopped working half way to Bangkok. All in all, a very good seat not backed up by a first class experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-21;"Gatwick to Mauritius via Dubai. Packed flights on the A380 there and back. Service seems to take ages. The food out of Gatwick was revolting but on other sectors was good especially the fish coming out of Mauritius. Found it odd that they serve food first and then come round with drinks as it means you've finished eating before you get a drink. The food needs to be hotter, mine was barely warm enough. The crew on the Boeing 777 coming back to LGW seemed more efficient and friendly than any of the A380 crews. The IFE is outstanding on Emirates, so much to choose from. The drawback for flying on Boeing 777 for me was having to be bussed to some remote stand at Dubai, it took ages to get to the plane. It seems that the A380's get the airbridges and the B777's have all been kicked out to the back of beyond. The low rating for WIFI is because I didn't use it.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-21;"My husband and I flew Emirates from Lusaka to Dubai, on the way to China during mid September. We are Platinum and Gold card holders respectively, and frequent fliers of Emirates on the Lusaka-Dubai route on Business class. We were upgraded from Business Class to First Class for this specific flight, and were appalled at the quality of the A340 Premium products. For all the wonderful advertisements (and personal experiences) on premium products on the A380s and B777s, the product on the LUN-DXB sector is something that definitely needs to change. Business Class seats themselves are not fully flat beds, only the old cradle seats, hence was pleased to be upgraded to First Class, but we weren't aware of what was coming. We got First Class seats where the recline and leg rests were not working. Hence was made to stand and wait 20 minutes in the aisle while the flight attendants tried to manually recline our seats. Although this was done, the leg rest was not able to be manually reclined, hence was given boxes, yes boxes and pillows in order to rest our legs. For one of the so called best airlines in the world, that is completely unacceptable. This is something that no one should experience on First class, especially if someone pays the very high fares Emirates offers. To make things worse, when complaining through email to Emirates, we got a response saying ""technical faults can develop at any point,"" implying that even if you pay more for a Business/First class seat, there is no guarantee that you will get a good seat on Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-21;"Booked the Emirates flight from Doha to Colombo via Dubai in the middle of November, made a mistake of returning day and changed it within 3 hours - but still they charged changing fees. Become skymiles member, as its end of December it will expire without using and I requested to be upgraded and reduce my skymiles. Even though the plane took off from Colombo more than half empty they still didn't want to give the upgrade experience for their customers. Tried to book bulkhead seat but all of them were pre booked. When you go to the flight more than half of bulkhead seat was empty. Poor service and Emirates could have done better than this, ground handling staff from Colombo helped me to get bulkhead seat which made my whole journey comfortable. seams The inflight service was good, but probably this will be the last time with Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-20;"Flew Brisbane to Auckland return on Emirates A380's. We were delayed on the tarmac in Brisbane for the Brisbane - Auckland flight due to the power shutting down on the plane when taxiing back from the gate. The pilot said he had to reset some computer settings and then the power came back on. Then as we were taxiing, he stopped and advised that the water system wasn't working. So he was going to do some resetting on the tarmac to see if the computers could reset the water supply. After about an hour of this, he went back to the gate to have engineers look at it (another 45 mins or so) and finally we were on our way 2 hours late. It wasn't very comforting to hear the pilot not finish sentences on occasion when giving us updates - it was as though he drifted off! Also, my husband's headset was broken, he asked for a new one but unfortunately a new headset never arrived. If it had been a longer flight, he would have followed this up. The food was pretty cold due to the delay, and there was the rudest male cabin supervisor I've ever come across. I went to ask for some water from the galley (as after the service, the cabin crew do a pretty good job of disappearing to avoid being asked for service I guess). I was standing there for a few minutes and he knew it, and he never even asked how he could help. I had to ask him! He basically ignored me and was generally grumpy when and unsmiling when he did go up and down the aisle during the service. The way back was much better with friendlier cabin crew, a coherent pilot and a plane that had no issues apart from my headset jack not providing stereo this time. The food was fine this time too. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-20;"Los Angeles to Johannesburg via Dubai. Everything was as expected. The only downside on the entire trip was lack of Wi-Fi. Given that we were flying over the North Pole on the first leg, I can understand it, but it is still something Emirates should work on for the long haul flights. The leg from DXB to JNB was on a 777. Not as nice as the A380, but still great. They woke us up to feed us, which I thought was a nice touch, although I could see some people not liking it. I think the biggest problem with Emirates business class is that there's really no need to fly first class. The Business Class experience was better than the First Class trips I've had. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-19;"Dubai to Orlando, seat 37K paid AED8045 for my ticket. Emirates 16 hour flight - inadequate feeding arrangements I plan to pack a snack pack on the return flight from Orlando. Meal served soon after take off was satisfactory. Then pizza soon after, which I declined because I wasn't hungry. 4 hours before landing I requested a piece of fruit or a dry cracker, the menu suggested that these snacks are available between meals. I was told that there was nothing left, ""everything has been demolished"" I was told by a steward. Whilst I understand the limitations of food on board, I would expect something small to snack on for a flight of this length. Eventually, after saying how astounded I was, one of the stewards said they knew where a stash could be found! Why was it not readily available anyway? He gave me two small packets. Worse still, every cup of coffee I had was lukewarm so I asked for tea, that was worse, it looked like dish water, the colour was not tea! The icing on the cake, I asked for a drink of fruit juice an hour and a half before landing and the steward said there was none available because it was all packed away! I am astounded and disgusted.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-18;"Auckland to Manchester via Dubai. Nice to report on a positive experience with Emirates. Check-in quick, lounge access OK but a bit crowded. Flight from Auckland very good, food and drink choices excellent, even managed some sleep. Business class bar was well occupied. Second flight from Dubai to Manchester even better as we were given a First class upgrade and we appreciated the increase in the luxury level, with the food, drink and shower. Baggage claim and driver service super quick. All in all an excellent experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-15;"I am a regular traveler between Dubai and Los Angeles and notice if there is any improvements made on this route since the last trip in June 2015. Overall journey was pleasant, departure was nearly half-an-hour late due to offloading luggage of passengers who could not travel that day, but the captain promised to make up the time lost throughout the flight. Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard. A minor tweak on the menu since the last time and improvement was noticed in this flight. Poach eggs served on the breakfast menu in this flight has improved since the last flight I took.  Wifi still not really working. Due to recent event in San Bernardino, I was held up at the LAX immigration, due to the origin of my travel was from an Arab country. After all the searches completed 5 hours later, I exited LAX and could not found the limousine driver. However, I can not really put the blame on Emirates, as me being held up by the LAX border protection was something that none of us planned for. Keep on improving Emirates, your passengers notice and appreciate them.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-15;"I paid a little more to take the A380 from Paris to Dubai. This aircraft is really comfortable: quiet and wide.  Entertainment system is one of the best I saw, and the food pretty good. But the  transit in Dubai was a nightmare. The airport itself is good, but the connecting time was way too long. The A380 was parked on the tarmac and unloaded by bus! I thought Dubai was Emirates hub, but they use buses to unload these aircraft.  20 minutes drive to get to the terminal. I thought the bus drove us downtown. And it was the same for the connecting flight - very disappointing.";POSITIVE

Boarded on time. Flight Departed on time. Again I say this. EK crew quality has come down a lot. Most of them just seem to be there for glamour and stand around like robots. IFE good. Food very bad. Arrived on time. Bags out on time. Good value for money based on price paid. Would I go out of the way to fly even though I am a GOLD Member. No I will think twice.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-13;"I flew on the Emirates A380  and really enjoyed this trip in economy. Unfortunately there were some queues at Dubai Aurport. But the service in the plane was fantastic. I couldn't really notice a big difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777-300. I think that the A380 is quiter, it looks better and feels bigger. Food and entertainment system (ICE) amazing. Very big selection of music and movies in different languages. Great staff. I really enjoyed this flight.";POSITIVE

Boeing 777-300er looked new, seat was comfortable with a quite big screen and USB. Headphones and blankets were distributed and the menu in economy was a nice touch. I enjoyed the entertainment system: lots of music and movies available in different languages. There was only 1 meal service during this flight, which was vey good. Shortly before landing a snack was served, you could choose from ice cream and hot cookies. The crew was nice and helpful, they smile and it seems like their are happy to serve you. Really nice product for 6h flight.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-12;"Flew Emirates from MAN-DXB, outbound flight 02/12/15. Excellent service by the crew on the morning flight from Manchester, the 777 was an older aircraft so the entertainment system was the older ICE system but it worked well with plenty of choices of movies, TV programmes and music. Wi-Fi available on this aircraft and it worked well for the bargain price of a $1.00. Meal service was a let down as the food was cold and the portions seemed to have shrunk since my last flight with Emirates last year. Plenty of drink runs available and the flight was only half full so plenty of space available. Landed in to Dubai 20 minutes earlier. I much prefer the 777 over the A380.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-12;"Flew Emirates DXB-MAN, 07/12, afternoon flight on the A380. On boarding the aircraft we were greeted by miserable cabin crew so got the feeling it wasn't going to be a great flight and we were correct. The flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by Emirates standards. No pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. Crew were surly and clearly didn't want to be at work that day. Asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. If they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldn't be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. Cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. A very small sandwich and a tiny scone. The aircraft was immaculate as it was only 3 months old. Flight landed 40 minutes early. I would fly Emirates again but would avoid the A380 where possible.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-11;"We couldn't have asked for a better ending for a week long vacation in the UAE, as we flew back to India on an Emirates A380. I was glad that all the excitement paid off with this flight. EK500 operating on the DXB-BOM sector had already occupied its gate (B20), even before we cleared our formalities. The flight, needless to say is big and the number of people waiting to get on board is a clear sign of that. The cabin crew on board were polite and never dropped their smile throughout the flight duration. The legspace gets in more inches than a B777 (that we used for BOM-DXB) and the windows seem more larger. The night time ambient lighting adds to the drama with all the buttons overhead at the touch of a remote. The in-flight entertainment provides all the details of the flight and the most amazing outdoor camera locations one can ask for during the flight. The food was pretty good, if not exceptional and we were more than happy with the fact that it was piping hot. The cabin is very quiet once the Rolls Royce's are burnt at full throttle and you can hardly feel any vibrations. I would recommend everyone flying to Dubai to at least once experience their A380 aircrafts.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-11;"I have been traveling Emirates since 2005 and have found that the inflight service has been going downhill over the past 2 years. On 9th December, I flew from Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Dubai. I was extremely disappointed with the staff attitude. I found that the table was dirty and had food and tea/coffee stains on it. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they were completely indifferent towards it. They gave me a wet tissue and asked me to clean it myself. On my next flight from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam my vegetarian meal was given away to another passenger.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-10;"Paris CDG to Dubai. It was the first time we had flown with Emirates and we had a very easy trip. Staff pleasant, food good, flight on time. Seats comfortable. As it was a daytime flight we did not attempt to sleep but have no reason to think as a bed the seats would be as comfortable. A slightly strange layout in business class. Seems to be more directed at solo travellers.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-09;"Our flight (EK507) got delayed by an hour and it left quite a sour experience at the start of our vacation.  The aircraft was well maintained and the crew were quite welcoming right from the door. The food served on board was of decent quality, but they ran out of the non-vegetarian course by the time the trolley reached my seat. We landed around 45 minutes after our schedulued arrival, and we missed our connecting bus (Emirates shuttle) to Abu Dhabi, as it left sharp at 7 PM. The surprising part about all this is that Emirates dont take any liability for missed bus connections, as it is apparently hosted by a 3rd party. I hope that in future Emirates do take this flaw in account, so as to make sure that passengers missing the bus connection due to a flight delay are not inconvinienced.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-09;Karachi to New York via Dubai. Best flight I have experienced. The staff was very nice and cooperative. They have the best entertainment system with the latest collection of movies. The food is okayish and better than many airlines. The planes are also new. I should mention that Dubai Airport is the best airport I have visited.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-12-09;"We choose Emirates from CDG to PVG via DXB because of the cheap price and it had been recommended to us. However, I did not really enjoy this experience. The food is some of the best in economy class. But the IFE screen needs improvements as it is not as clear as some other airlines. The cabin crew service from Dubai to Shanghai was rude and impatient. Furthermore, the seat was not that comfortable, the space was acceptable, but the quality of the seat was poor - the headrest was made of the same material as the lazyback instead of artificial leather, so, if you put you head on it for a long time, you hair would stick to the headrest. Overall, a so-so flight. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-12-08;"The flight from Brisbane to Singapore was very good. Friendly and helpful staff. We had an annoying 75 minute stop in Singapore with a change of crew before the flight to Dubai. The whole demeanour of things changed. The new crew members on the whole seemed rude and abrupt. A young woman travelling on her own was not allowed a bassinet for her young child, whereas she had experienced no problems Brisbane to Singapore. I took up the advocate's role but to no avail. I asked to speak with the Purser but was brushed off. I do not intend flying Emirates again once this holiday is over.";NEGATIVE

The flight attendants were professional and attentive with lots of water runs between meals. Some crew were friendlier than others but you get that with every airline. The meals were great, and we got our choice on each sector. The food was tasty and varied. There have been some bad reviews regarding the 3x4x3 layout, but this wasn't a problem for us, the width of seats similar to other airlines. The aisles may be a bit narrower. Connection times were good but Dubai airport is a zoo and certainly not relaxing at all, most of the time you have to battle your way through a sea of humanity. Emirates was good value, will fly with them again.";POSITIVE

Check in at BKK was smooth, lounge was nice, small, but with a decent selection of hot and cold food, and alcohol. Half-full cabin. Nice and chatty cabin crew, but the service seemed quite rushed. Excellent champagne, food just ok - appetisers were very cold, main course was nice, but presentation was below expectation. Suite experience, toilet with shower, and nice cabin crew made our day. Good value for money on this short sector.";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-12-01;"I was very pleased with the service I received on Emirates. Everyone was professional, attentive and able to handle situations with difficult passengers easily. The food was good and a lot of it. There were two meal services and a pizza service in between the meals. Drinks offered frequently. The seats were comfortable and a lot of legroom. The stars on the ceiling of the plane when it is dark outside was a nice touch. On my flight to Dubai from New York the plane was half full, so most people went to their own row and stretched out to sleep. On the way back from Dubai to New York the plane was full, but I still felt comfortable for the almost 16 hours I was on the plane. IFE was very good and I was able to finally catch up on watching movies I had not yet seen. The only small problem I had was that the free wifi was not working on my phone, but other people seemed to connect to the wifi easily. I would fly Emirates again without hesitation.";POSITIVE

Upon boarding, FAs greeted passengers. Once seated, hot towel was distributed. After take off a refreshment was provided. I ordered a lacto-ovo diet and in my past experience, I was given sandwich and some dessert/cake, however this time I was a bit disappointed that I was only given 1 piece of vegetarian rolls. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing, and the best onboard breakfast that I have had. Emirates also provide stickers so flight attendants know whether to wake up or not. Inflight entertainment was superb, plenty of choices and the front/bottom aircraft camera view was available. The ICE on this aircraft hasn't been upgraded yet (wasn't ICE widescreen) but still enjoyable. Wi-fi was also available in this flight for those who prefer browsing to watching the IFE, and the connection speed was pretty fast. Apart from during take off and landing, mobile phone were allowed to be used onboard. The seat was comfortable and the headrest is adjustable. Flight attendants were friendly. Cabin and toilet was clean.  The cabin mood lighting was nice. Combs, razor and toothbrush/toothpaste availabe in the lavatory.  Overall, I had an impeccable experience with Emirates and will fly with them again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-30;"Mumbai to New York JFK via Dubai. Every time I fly with Emirates their service seems to be on a decline. Dubai to New York their meal service was horrible. They provided a menu which they usually do with 3 options. However the vegetarian option in the menu (both breakfast and lunch) was available only for those who had pre selected meal preferences. Not sure how it makes sense to include something in the menu when it is not really available for selection. Secondly, their flights are freezing cold and flight attendants always seem to be in a hurry to collect blankets. On one leg of the journey they collected blankets one hour prior to landing in a freezing flight. Not a pleasant flying experience overall and not worth the cost of tickets.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-30;"Cape Town to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane in Emirates first class.  Decided to splash out. Paid just over NZD 13000 which seemed like a good deal. Flight out of Cape Town was uneventful - staff great, older aircraft but nice inside, Cape Town BIDVest lounge absolutely horrible. Arrival at Dubai is at 1am and the airport is buzzing at that time of the morning. Lounge very big and spacious. Priority fast track means nothing at Dubai. It doesn't help to show it or anything, everyone just seems to use the same lines for security. Flight to Brisbane early morning 10am departure on A380, Very new aircraft. Seat fantastic and showers just great! Staff was a bit of a miss, food pretty good though. Transit at BNE very efficient, lounge is great with lots of food options. Flight to Auckland on same aircraft, different staff and they were the best out of all the staff I had. Very attentive and caring. Flight to AKL a short hop but very nice experience. AKL immigration a pain as 3 Emirates A380s arrived in the space of 40mins.

emirates;2015-11-28;Karachi to Boston via Dubai with Emirates. I had a very disappointing experience with Emirates. I have been a travelling musician and always travel with my guitar. Having always put it close to me in the plane I always travel with a softcase. This time I travelled to Boston I was coerced at Karachi airport and given absolutely no choice but to check in my guitar. Knowing the fragility of a guitar it is unacceptable to check it in regardless of all fragile handling protocol an airline may have. A guitar is too sensitive to be checked in. Upon arriving at Boston my guitar was nowhere to be found at baggage claim and after filing a claim it reached me a few days later. And when I unzipped my case I noticed my guitar's headstock is fractured and the guitar received dents regardless of Emirates ensuring fragile handling.  ;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-28;Singapore to Chicago via Dubai with Emirates. The crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. Passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. The crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. I assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. Not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality. I have had experience with many other airlines around the world and this is certainly the worst service and worst food ever. I will never take Emirates again. For similar value I would choose Qatar airways.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-27;Delhi to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in good and fast and the Delhi Lounge not bad. Flight out of Delhi was delayed and cancelled due to technical reasons. Delhi airport staff do not know how to handle a crisis. Passengers were left high and dry. Hotels and/or comfort was not provided to passengers in a reasonable manner. Replacement flight EK8515 left Delhi 20 hrs later. Crew on the replacement flight pretty bad. Food on board Emirates flights is very poor now. EK406 to MEL. Flight departed and arrived on time. IFE not bad. Wifi advertised was slow and bad. Bottom line is that Emirates is suffering from over expansion. The airline has lost common grip and basics of customer care. Being a Gold member with EK I am looking elsewhere now.;NEGATIVE

Myself and my wife prefer travelling with Emirates, due to their flexibility around routes out of Manchester and previous experience of flying with Emirates from London Heathrow and Gatwick via Dubai to Mauritius. The meals in Economy class have deteriorated in my view. The portions are much smaller and needs reviewing by Emirates. I purchased $1 of wifi access, and its reliability was poor at times, and cannot be relied upon. On a positive note, we flew on the new 2 class Airbus A380 (A6-EOP) and the flight was good (with the exception of meals). They did regularly offer drinks and snacks throughout the flight - this was not observed on the other three Emirates flights. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-26;"This is my 6th Business class trip this year with Emirates. Checking was done in Melbourne by Qantas, all went smoothly. The EK lounge in Sydney is a nice and cosy. Great food and service. Boarding the flight was a nightmare, there was no priority lane in place, it was a dogs breakfast. I have never encountered that before on any airlines. After take off, we were given mattresses straight away - how about asking priority passengers what they would like to drink after take off and what their meal requests would be? That was a first. The crew always give the mattresses after dining. Just very strange and not logical. I was seating in 7K which was located at the very front section of the business class. After a long 1h30, we were given our departure drink and cold nuts, then asked to chose our dinner. No wine request was offered with the meal, we had to ask for it. I've asked for my cheese platter to be served after I finish my main meal. I got my starter, the chicken roulade and salad - I had to send back my meal, the whole food that I just got was far too chilled. There were pieces of ice on the Salad and the chicken, I just couldn't believe what was served on my plate.  No coffee or tea were offered to my section, no refill of our drinks or bread and I never got my cheese platter. By that stage, I've had enough. 2 hours before landing, I've ordered a Lite Bites, waited only 5 minutes which I thought was pretty amazing considering during the flight I've had to press the Call Button 3-4 times to get some water (then asked for a big bottle therefore I was sure to have the water when I needed it and without disrupting the crew) well my snack was cold so I had to send it back again! The crew who were designated to look after my section really failed on that flight, they were non existent during the flight, didn't care one bit about their passengers. I'm starting to get very annoyed with Emirates, every time it's a win or a miss but over my 6 business trips this year it has been a miss. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-24;"Melbourne to Rome via Kuala Lumpur & Dubai. My husband and I booked a trip to Italy with our two young children. The flight is around 21 hrs not including transfers & upon recommendations from several friends we decided to travel with Emirates. I do not have one good thing to say about them! We experienced every family's worst fears about international plane travel with everything from poor, slow service, judgemental staff, pathetic kids meals (the kids were served spaghetti bolognaise on 5/6 flights), rude staff refusing to give the kids their 'complimentary' toy (which we had to beg for!), and to top it all off we had all been separated on one flight, despite booking our seats online. My four year old son and seven year old daughter were sitting 10 and 15 rows away from myself with my husband sitting another 7 rows behind me! All up we were spread right through the economy cabin and no-one wanted to help us, each blaming the next point of transfer as the responsible party. Originally I made an online complaint to Emirates while on holiday, hoping at the bare minimum, they'd be able to offer some palatable food to our children inflight. The response I got, as well as being ridiculously late and outside the timeframe given, was pathetic. suggesting I should just bring my own food in future, with no useful advice or empathy shown! Emirates has been my worst flight experience ever, I am a rather experienced traveller, having flown with at least 15 different airlines and never have I been so dismally disappointed. I will never fly with Emirates again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-23;"My husband and I purchased tickets for $38,000. to fly first class on Emirates from San Francisco to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook. After several more hours getting our bags and finding our way out of the airport we bumped into a fellow passenger who told us Emirates would pay for a room at a local hotel. We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience. The delay caused us to lose out on the first day of our Safari which cost us roughly $2000, and we could not recoup. I wrote a letter to Emirates saying that we understood these mechanical problems do happen but given the cost of our ticket we wanted better compensation.  I got a polite letter back telling us basically ""no"" that they had done all they were going to do, and that was the end of it. I was pretty stunned at that response given that after having paid $38,000. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-23;"Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai and was really disappointed with Emirates. The onboard service was slow and appeared disorganised. We were 2 hours into the flight before we were offered a drink and even then the stewardess seemed uninterested. The food was bland and repetitive. There were two options with one always being chicken. There was never enough of the second meal choice option. The seating was comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment was okay but the same on each connecting flight. Some screens also failed on the plane causing complaints. On a whole, an average experience for the price. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-22;"I travelled on Emirates with my wife and 2 month old baby from London to Lahore via Dubai return. Our bassinet seats were changed on all flights apart from Heathrow to Dubai despite having reserved and requested bassinet seats. The staff attitude was terrible as our seats were changed at Dubai and they just would not give me a reason despite asking on a number of occasions to why they have changed our seats, upon checking my reserved seats once boarded only to discover another couple with a child sitting in our reserved seats. On return flight from Dubai to London we were told a number of times we had got my bassinet seats as reserved even up until the point we was boarding. When we boarded the plane we had recieved seats 1 behind the Bassinet seats -  so I complained and nothing was done about it. However,  a nice passenger in one of the bassinet seats gave his up so my wife could sit there with the baby, he and many others around could not understand why we had been changed and people not needing bassinet seats given them. I have flown with Emirates for many years, but this was by far the worst trip ever in terms of staff attitude and making this journey more difficult than needed be especially whilst traveling with a 2 month old baby. I won't travel with Emirates again after this journey. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-18;"London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Dubai was a fantastic experience. Great lounge at T , planes on time, food and service was great. Bar at the back is a great place to while away some time. Wifi was not perfect, and the lounge at Dubai lacks the appeal of that at Heathrow T3 and Hong Kong. Overall a great experience and value for money. Chauffeur service to and from airport was another great facility.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-17;What a relief to change from Qantas to Emirates on our flight from Dubai to Brisbane. Seats in Row 57F/G chosen and were comfortable. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient and treated people like people. Meals were excellent and the gluten free options were the best my partner has had on a flight with one exception. A snack (pizza) was served late at night but there was no gluten free snack. The crew asked if fruit or something else could be provided. Flight was on time. After flying with Qantas for 20+ years I'm switching to Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-16;"We were booked onto Emirates from Dubai to Munich due to the Lufthansa strike and were very satified with the flight. Spacious legroom, good service, friendly crew and a great IFE. Flying on the A380 is a real pleasure, it is a little more quiet in the cabin and you have a great calm flight even if some turbulences come up. The flight was on time and online check-in was fast and easy. I would fly Emirates again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-16;Manchester to Doha via Dubai return with Emirates. We arrived at the airport to find that the plane had been changed and our seats that we had carefully selected had been changed - with us scattered all over the place. This is not just an inconvenience but made worse when you are travelling with children - other cheaper airlines have noticed that we are travelling with children and have made sure we are seated together even when we have not paid extra for this (like Thomas Cook). The ground staff managed to find us seats together in the end but much further back in the plane. To make it worse they did the same thing on the way home on our Doha to Dubai flight. This time I checked just before we left and rang them - they could only seat 4 of us together and the rest were scattered. When I got home I emailed them to complain and after a long time got a reply to say that this is just how it is. I expected better for a company that sells itself as having good service and are so expensive. Its a sad day when I get better service from a holiday company chartered flight compared to Emirates. After all the messing about spoiled the flight - this is one of the best parts of the holiday for my family. If a family aren't seated together it doesn't matter what film you show or food you give.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-15;"Great service, food and cabin atmosphere. The only issue with this flight was that my seat wouldn't recline properly and the staff couldn't resolve the issue. Disappointing but still an enjoyable flight. The lounge food in Sydney was superb, as was the drink selection. I am a gold member with Emirates and endorse their products, just too bad that they teamed up with Qantas as a codeshare partner.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-14;"Jakarta to Paris via Dubai with Boeing 777 from Jakarta to Dubai and A380 from Dubai to Paris. I was impressed with the cabin interior. The seat color was calm yet it still gave something confident. Before take-off, the flight attendants gave the menu to all passengers. Jakarta-Dubai flight was served with two meals. I was surprised with the flight attendant that has different languages, 18 in total, this would be very helpful with the passenger who couldn’t speak English very fluently. The meal for me was standard, as I could find a meal better in other airlines. I hope I could get better meal in my next flight to Paris since I thought the flight would use A380, but it was still the same. The flight attendant seemed so hurried in serving the meals. The meal to Paris was served a bit later until dinner time, and I was like starving since they didn’t give us more snack. The best thing in the flight was the IFE.  And it also had the camera that was very interactive.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-14;"Flying back to Jakarta from Amsterdam via Dubai. The flight from Amsterdam was more or less the same as the flight from Dubai to Paris with A380. But the flight attendant from Amsterdam to Dubai was a bit unprofessional. I asked to have my headset replaced, but it didn’t come until I asked another FA. During meal time, I saw an old couple not get the meal. When everyone had half of his meal, they still don’t get the meal. IFE was good during the whole flight. The flight Dubai to Jakarta (Boeing 777) was not as good as I had thought. For almost 1/3 of the journey I could not sleep on my seat. The fleet was different when I flew from Jakarta to Dubai before. This flight looked old. The IFE screen even made me not want to watch. The legroom was also a bit narrow.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-12;"Dusseldorf to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates. Excellent service provided. Ground staff in DUS a bit slow, would recommend no online check in since only one counter for the whole group of online check in's. Boeing 777 a bit old, but motivated and friendly staff. A380 turns out to be the first plane I can even sit in a middle seat and actually sleep. Not extremely good but at least I can place my legs somewhere.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-11;"Emirates from Durban to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane. The first flight from Durban to Dubai I cannot fault. Comfy seats, where I requested to be sat online. Great onboard entertainment, clean and really friendly, positive staff. Food was delicious and plenty to drink. My flight from Dubai to Brisbane was not so great. Second lot of security before getting on the plane that wouldn't allow me to take my water bottle that I had brought at the departure gate. Not in the seat I had allocated online for. Admittedly the rest of my negative experience I can't blame Emirates for. But I do think they should get rid of the ability to put the seat so far back. I basically had the guy in front on my lap the whole way, and I was trying to sleep by leaning on the fold up tray, when he forced his seat right back - it resulted in a limb on my head and a cricked neck. This was then followed by screaming kids for most of the 14hr flight. However due to lack of being able to sleep the aircraft did have brilliant inflight entertainment. Particularly enjoyed the cameras mounted out side the plane that you can watch.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-10;"London to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai with Emirates. Inflight entertainment was wonderful with many selections to choose from. Food was rather okay too, considering I ordered a gluten free meal. The seat was hard to sleep in and the cabin was sometimes too cold. I needed to use a couple of blankets on these flights as it was just too cold. Service was below average. Asked for orange juice and water twice from two different cabin crew, but it never showed up. I had to go to the galley myself to take the drinks because no one attended to my call.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-09;"New York JFK to Milan. I've flown the Emirates A380 on short haul flights from BKK to HKG in First Class which is a noticeable improvement over the Business Class product. As many write, there are a number of seats in the Business Class cabin that are much worse than others. I did my homework before selecting the outbound seats. Per recommendation (traveling with a significant other), I picked seats 20 E/F that had the mini bar on the aisle, which allows you to sit closer to your friend/partner/spouse. The problem with these is that our middle armrests were so small and narrow that really only one of us could use it at a time. On our flight back to New York we opted to sit apart and chose seats 18K and 20K. These seats have the mini bar on the aisle, and you do have a nice more private experience. The huge plus of these seats is that you get lots of storage space next to your seat under the windows that is nonexistent in the other middle seat configurations (E/F and D/G). This allows you to put away your laptop bag, blanket etc, without getting up into the overhead bins during flight. This would also be the case for the ""A"" seats on the other side of the plane. We found these much more comfortable and didn't mind sitting apart for the flight. The flight attendants are very hit or miss with Emirates. On our outbound JFK-Milan flight, most were pretty bad. Not particularly helpful or available. They disappear after the very rushed dinner service. On our return flight the good FAs outnumbered the bad. The thing that agitated the most on both flights is the disregard that the attendants have for being quiet. They love to congregate and talk loudly between sections behind row 21. As well, they seemed to always getting into the overhead bins and slamming them shut. This woke me us several times. The other thing that I disliked is that the restrooms are next to the galley in the back of the Business class cabin in such a way that it almost seemed unsanitary and without privacy. You have the toilets between the lounge/bar with uncovered food, and the galley where they are preparing food. With no curtain separating the toilet section from the galley section, you have a bunch of FAs standing around on one side and guests in the bar area on the other that you must walk through to get to and from the toilet. We found the food offering pretty subpar for a business class product. The beverage service and offering was above average.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-07;"Sydney to Bangkok with Emirates. I was unhappy with the Check-In staff member who mistakenly added the weight of my carry-on cabin bag to my Checked luggage, requiring me to repack my bags, but when I eventually got back to (different) check-in desk my checked luggage was well under the 30kgs allowed, so I ended up checking both bags and carrying the plastic bag that I was going to post as my carry-on. The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-07;"Emirates A380 provides you with excellent flat-bed seat with great privacy, best IFE around, and good drinks. The onboard bar/lounge is a nice to have, and fun place to go for a walk. Quality of the FAs is unpredictable, had some outstanding ones while others were really sub-par. Catering on EK business class is below quality offered by QR economy class, but I do not fly for the food experience. Just give me a superior seat/bed, the better IFE, and a global routes network.";POSITIVE

No complaints  and based on our experience on these flights would definitely use Emirates again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-05;Durban to Gatwick via Dubai. The Emirates inflight entertainment helps you to not notice the space your seat in economy has to offer on the Boeing 777-300ER.

emirates;2015-11-04;"Check in at Glasgow was a bit unpleasant, with the counter staff insisting on weighing and tagging hand luggage, which already had an Emirates Skywards Gold Card on it. Every airline has frosty staff. The lounge in Glasgow is pleasant and well presented. The aircraft on the Glasgow to Dubai Leg was modern and in good condition. Inflight entertainment was good with WIFI available. Quality of cabin service was good with a good selection of food and drinks. Flight landed on time with good communication from the cockpit. Transfers in Dubai Airport are pretty simple and painless. Boarding in Dubai for the flight to Addis Ababa was a shambles. For some reason all the staff were rude and looked a bit confused. The aircraft to ADD was awful, a very old Airbus that should have been retired a long time ago. Emirates lost my luggage. They have no local agent in ADD (not sure if thats true but it is what I was told). I then had to find my own luggage, namely travelling out to the airport to try and find my own luggage on subsequent days. The Emirates product you would normally expect in other countries is almost non existent in Addis Ababa. Rude staff, poor Lost baggage processes, very old aircraft.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-11-03;"Flew London Gatwick to Melbourne return with Emirates, two segments were on the older Boeing 777 Dubai to Melboune, business class seats 9J aisle, ok - but the service was excellent as was food. Cabin crew introduced themselves at the start of the flight and made sure that you had everything you wanted. The seat on this leg was just an angled lie flat seat, with a foot rest to stop you slipping off the end, and it needed the mattress to make it more comfortable. It was different on the LGW Dubai LGW segments as this was on the A380, seat 9k was extemely comfortable, although the gap to get in was very narrow if you are slighly larger person. Again the service and food was excellent, could not fault it. If I fly to Melbourne again with Emirates will try and make sure its the A380 all the way, just for the comfort.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-11-03;"A380 excellent aircraft. Awful Emirates service. I had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to London from Dubai. The flight was 3 hours delayed with the only explanation being that there was technical difficulties. Unless you travel by business class or first class you are treated like cattle and hearded on to the plane as such. Once onboard it doesn't get any better in cattle class. Requests for anything, like an extra blanket because it was so cold, are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request. I chose to fly Emirates only because of the A380 but if I knew the staff were going to be so rude I wouldn't have bothered. Next time I'll read the airline reviews before deciding how to travel. One good point about the aircraft is the Internet access, I can write this review while I'm on the flight.";NEGATIVE

After complaining the staff called security who threatened the passengers for taking away their passport as if they have any legal right to do so. They also told passengers not to make any noise. In addition the last time I have checked in to Emirates at JFK I have been asked to place my hand carry so they can weigh it, no word of getting late, how are you, welcome, nothing.

Even the toilet facilities were roomy and well appointed. Staff were courteous and pleasant however myself and my travelling companion (both women in our mid fifties) often were overlooked with some service details while the young male passenger seated on the aisle next to us was always attended to, had meal trays collected (ours were left) and received regular complimentary drinks but we were never asked. A friend (also an older woman) mentioned she had a similar experience travelling business class with Emirates in May 2015 and had to ask the male passenger seated on the aisle next to her to assist with service requests. I've not experienced this with other airlines and maybe this needs to be addressed at the training level.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-29;"We were planning a trip to Perth to see our daughter, tragically my wife fell ill, diagnosed terminal within a few days. Just a few weeks later on the day the flight was leaving, after an Emirates flight reminder, she died in just 7 short weeks. During her illness I tried to cancel the flight and use the money to fly my daughter back. Although I thought I had purchased one return ticket with one set of conditions that allowed cancellation, the return flight unknown to me had its own set of conditions that precluded any refund. After many emails and phone calls I was not able to cancel the flight and get a refund. After family help, with no help from Emirates, we got enough money together get my daughter home, tragically too late. During that time Emirates thanked me for my understanding and refused to help quoting terms and conditions of the return ticket and refused to consider changing a ticket to allow my daughter to fly back. They would retain my money and provide no help. During my wife’s illness MacMillan Cancer Support contacted Emirates on several occasions and attempted to help get my daughter home using the tickets or a refund on the purchased tickets. The same reply was given to MacMillan Cancer Support as was given to me, despite them talking to senior staff. Emirates final email thanked me for my understanding in these difficult times, saying they could do nothing to help. MacMillan Cancer Support wrote to Emirates to express their concerns over the lack of compassion and support, to-date there has been no reply. If you fly with Emirates pray you will not need their help because they will thank you for your understanding and take your money and leave you alone to sort it out.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2015-10-27;"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Overall, not a bed flight apart from the seats. Used the Emirates lounge in concourse B which is excellent. The food and drinks offerings are outstanding and there are a number of great seating options. The lounge is truly enormous and it would be easy to spend a long time in here. I was actually disappointed when I had to leave. The only complaint was the shower room was extremely hot which made getting dressed very uncomfortable. Second flight on an A380 was excellent. The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours. Breakfast was served before arrival in Shanghai and it was once again, very good. On arrival in Shanghai, first and business class have a separate baggage carousel and bags arrived promptly. Emirates provide a great service and connecting in Dubai is flawless. The lounge is really heaven on earth.";POSITIVE

The staff were unhelpful and if a question was asked or a request made, the look you received was painful.  The flight to Dubai was exactly the same. This this was my first time in this region. I felt the people in the UAE were so friendly and helpful and Dubai is spotlessly clean, our only real disappointment was Emirates. The captain announced that there were eleven cabin staff on the plane - what were they doing? One girl was kind and had a smile. She even admitted to us that she didn't and wouldn't eat the meals on board.  I had an elderly parent in Business Class and he fared little better apparently. We had approximately forty minutes waiting on luggage, whilst there was no other plane landed at Newcastle competing for resources. This may be an issue with the airport, but worth mentioning as indicative of the poor service we received. ";NEGATIVE

I was disappointed to see that if you choose to pay in cash for the ticket through a bank in Thailand there is a new local EK service fee of 600 baht as opposed to a standard EK Western Union transfer fee of 200 baht. The online checkin was smooth and the check in staff at BKK and LHR helpful. Flights were on time and the aircraft was clean and well maintained on all sectors. The ICE system kept me entertained for hours and I noticed they have changed to new square softer headphones. The transit in Dubai was smooth and professionally controlled. I did not eat anything so I cant comment on the food. The crew were charming, I have noticed a massive shift in crew attitude over the past 2 years. Emirates is now my airline of choice once again.";POSITIVE

Meals were slow and on both legs one of the meal options was not available by the time they got to us. On the second occasion I refused the meal offered as I didn't want another stew and I had had enough. I was eventually provided with the meal I wanted but it was put down with ill grace. My partner is vegetarian but he is not vegan. Surely Emirates could provide for both and not treat vegetarians as vegan? His meals were awful and inadequate and he had to have my cheese and biscuits as he was left hungry.;NEGATIVE

In Melboune waited for EK 406 to take us to Auckland, full flight, don't like so much the A380-800, the seats a bit more space but less privacy like the Boeing 777-300.

emirates;2015-10-21;"The lure of a stopover in Dubai when flying Orlando to Cape Town was strong. Departed Orlando on the third day after the inaugural flight. In Business Class, Emirates offers limo pick up, which we did. I need a wheelchair, and that went very smoothly to the Business Lounge in Orlando - they were using a very small space, but nice lunch buffet. Seats 9A/B were fairly comfortable as were the other seats we had. Thank goodness for the addition of the long pad for sleeping. Remember the days of Delta being called ""Chicken airline"" because of their chicken meals, then Emirates should be called ""The Reboot airline"". On each of our four segments the computer had to be rebooted because either the ICE did not work, or the partition would not retract or the seat would not go into a flat position. Eventually my daughter had to move to another seat so she could sleep lying down - after all that is what we paid for. Otherwise, I would recommend Emirates to everyone. The service was excellent with only 40 business class passengers on the outward flight to Dubai, and 30 on the return flight. The flight attendants on the Orlando/Dubai segments both ways were so personable and looked after all the passengers. On the Dubai/Capetown segments they were competent, but aloof. One glitch was the wheelchair in Dubai on return trip - was told it was unnecessary as we would be in transit lounge. Not true. And in Orlando the chair was not visible until I finally just sat in the baggage lounge and said I was not going anywhere. We were fortunate to pay $8,000 for the two of us as a special offer.";POSITIVE

After our stopover in Singapore, the new cabin crew had been informed that my companion was not well. They kept an attentive eye throughout the entire flight and when we asked for some chocolate and they forgot because they were so busy, they went to Business Class and got the chocolate from there.

emirates;2015-10-16;"Emirates used to be 10/10 airline but as they secure more routes the service is getting worse. They are often late these days and I now leave at least a 4 hour gap to make sure I make the next flight in Dubai. For the latest flight from Manila to Dubai they forgot that there is heavy traffic on a Friday night and the crew arrived over 2 hours late - if all the passengers can get to the Airport on time then why can't the crew? What is so bad is that the ground staff lied about the situation when they told the economy passengers the aircraft needed more cleaning, but told the business class passengers the truth. There is no doubt that Emirates is undergoing a decline in service.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-15;"I was able to choose my seats for all four sectors on the round trip. I'm not a big man, so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem, and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. The A380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though, but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow, but the food was not bad at all. Service was slightly better on the DXB-SGN return legs, food reasonable but nothing to write home about. One thing I wish Emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it! A square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. Entertainment was good, except for the Boeing 777 leg (limited choices and poor picture quality), so slept, read, listened to music on that one. Certainly not the greatest service onboard but adequate. nothing that would stop me flying with them again, certainly for the value for money I get, and the convenience (from my perspective at least) of the flight times. Dubai T3 is another story altogether though. I've flown this route a few times now and it remains the worst part of the journey for me. It's not the two to three hour stop-over, I quite welcome the chance to get out, stretch, wash and change clothes, but the building itself - I find it poorly signposted, and just so busy and bustling I struggle to relax there. Would certainly use them again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-15;"Melbourne to Auckland on Emirates A380, pure luxury in every shape way and form. The flight was delayed on the way in, and the staff on the ground could have handled that better. But the fight, crew and facilities etc, I cannot fault in any shape way or form.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-14;"Barcelona to Manila via Dubai with Emirates. The seat and legroom seems bigger compared to the Emirates Boeing 777-300.

They also have toys and coloring books to keep them occupied.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-14;"Geneva to Singapore via Dubai, and Emirates was a cheaper option for this flight and seemed more convinient in terms of stop over time and departure/arrival times. Not only the price was cheap, meals served onboard were poor quality. The outbound flight from Dubai to Singapore was a nightmare, the plane was completely full and seating very bad, very little room. Tried to forget about the inconvenience by watching (ridiculously censored) films, but arrived exhausted from sitting in a cramped position for many hours. Staff seemed more interested in chatting to each other than attending to passengers, although they were not directly unfriendly.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-14;"Absolutely no complaints with any of the Emirates flights - Glasgow to Dubai, then a 2.5 hour stop, and onto Auckland via Melbourne. Cabin Crew were friendly, helpful and professional, with soft drinks and water offered frequently throughout all the flights. Meals were hot, with a choice of 2 main courses for dinner, and breakfast, and snacks were offered in between times too - actually this was unnecessary, as I had too much to eat. The seats could be more spacious and comfortable, but in Economy, this is never going to happen - you get what you pay for. Emirates are the best airline I have ever flown with, and live up to the praise and expectations which I had for them, prior to reading awful reviews.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-13;Personally escorted to my Seat 9A by a Vietnamese female flight attendant. I was told I would be looked after by this Cabin attedent throughout my flight and I most certainly was. As I has enjoyed a great breakfast in the Emirates lounge prior to my departure I only had the lite continental breakfast which was pleasant. I have a disability and as my seat was closer to the pointy end of the A380 when I went to use the bathroom I was quietly told I may use the First class facility as First class was empty. Just before landing in Auckland the attendant who had looked after me came and said goodbye then placed a Godiva chocolate with a small hand written note to enjoy my onward travels. Such a personal and special gesture. On arrival a wheelchair awaited me at the aircraft door and 40 min later I was thru customs and on my way to my domestic connection. Thank you Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-12;"The breakfast was an inedible cheese selection alongside cold slices of apple, so by the time lunch arrived I was ready for it. However there was turbulence which the pilot deemed bad enough to warrant asking the cabin crew to return to their seats a total of five times during lunch service! So when lunch was eventually served, it was cold, tough and as inedible as breakfast. Overall a really disappointing flight from a usually top class airline.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-12;"Sydney to Manchester via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur, included in the price, picked us up on time and following check in we settled in the lounge to await our flight. Flight left on time and arrived Dubai early. Emirates A380 has excellent suites in first with 23"" TV, privacy door which make your space entirely private and very comfortable seat. Following takeoff, watched a movie, got the seat into bed position with mattress and duvet, closed the doors and slept. Woke after 6 hours, ordered food and about two hours from Dubai used one of the two showers. Onward flight to Manchester, again A380, was the same and using the shower meant we arrived fresh. Chauffeur drive again home.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-12;"Departure from Singapore was on time. Good service by the crew very attentive. Loved the hot towels and the welcome drinks. Food was delicious but very small portions. Seats are very cramped 3x4x3 in a Boeing 777-300er. I asked for an eye shade and a mask and the flight attendant got it straight away, and spoke to me in Lebanese that I loved. I'd definitely fly with them again. Wish Emirates had a service out of Sydney with a stop in Singapore to connect EK 349.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-12;We arrived at Gatwick at about 10.30am for a 2.25 pm flight to Brisbane via Dubai and we were told there were no flights till 5 pm or tomorrow. We could board the 2.15 pm flight to Dubai. We were told to go to the National Express (bus) counter and get a bus to Heathrow. The bus arrived about 40 minutes later and we arrived at Heathrow at 1pm at the central bus station. It seemed to be about 1 mile walk to the Emirates check in. No trolleys were allowed on the walk : there were several trolley barriers during the walk.  When we arrived at the Emirates check in we were not in their system. Emirates at Gatwick had forgotten to re ticket us. We had to go to the Emirates counter to get ticketed and then back to check in. We were then the last people to be seated and we could not sit together. When I boarded I was seated next to an enormous man who sat with his legs apart and his arms spread out invading my seat space. My economy Emirates ticket was AUD $2800 which is very expensive. I'd traveled to France in May 2015 and my ticket was AUD $1700. We only got seating to Dubai and our boarding pass from Dubai to Brisbane was marked as standby even though we were picking up our original flight from Dubai to Brisbane. We had to get seating in Dubai and again we were not able to sit together. Again I was seated next to a very large man. I will never travel with Emirates again. I've flown every year to the UK since 1984 and sometimes twice a year. That was the worst experience I've ever had.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-11;"San Francisco to Dubai with Emirates. Exceptional inflight service and clean and fresh cabin. Luggage was not a problem and neither the crew at all. We arrived on time in DXB. The food was outstanding, entertainment was sub par. Bathrooms were kinda wet but manageable. Seat comfort was nice.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-11;"The first leg of my flight Amsterdam to Dubai was excellent. I can't say the same about the Dubai to Sydney flight. Nearly for two hours after departure (that was late - at 12:45) there was nothing served but the forms that was needed only at the Sydney airport. No water, no refreshment, nothing at all. Most of the passengers were transferring, being after another flight, tired, hungry and thirsty. Many children were on the flight too. Everybody just wanted to have some meal, something to drink as soon as possible and then sleep. But we had to wait for a long time for it to happen. Even when eventually the crew started serving it was very slow and unprofessional. They accidentally splashed drinks over passengers, pushed them without even apologising.  I will not recommend Emirates. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-10;Usually fly Emirates to Singapore as enjoy that it is an evening flight and you arrive in Singapore just before midnight. Check in was easy and headed straight to the Emirates Lounge. One thing I have noticed with the lounge over the years is that it has not been upgraded and service has been degrading for some time know. Food is average at best and the decor was very ordinary when comparing it to the other lounges. Decided not to upgrade onboard as flight was empty and had a whole row to my self. Flight was comfortable and meals adequate but not the best by far and the crew this time were excellent and flight was on time. I hope in future Emirates upgrades this flight to the A380 as it as a far superior product to the Boeing 777.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-09;"Overall, another pleasant flying experience with Emirates. All 4 flights on time. IFE is pretty good, so the boys were extremely happy. We have strict Vegetarian diet and the special meal requests were properly delivered on all segments. Kids goodies were pretty high spec. Legroom, service etc in economy class on any Middle East carrier has similar standards. It is the other factors such as flying on time, food, proper receipt of luggage etc that matter for family holidays by air.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-07;"Emirates cancelled our flight without warning. We found out as we approached the counter at the airport to check in. The staff was rude and dismissive, and the airport staff had zero direction as if they have never experienced a cancelled flight. They refused to refund our pre-paid hotel and travel costs in Italy, suggesting we inquire with the credit card co. we booked with. The service was aggressive and bizarre. Do they abuse their staffers into compliance?? A bad experience, lesson learned, cheap flights on a bad airline just not worth it. Will definitely not be flying them again anytime soon.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-06;"I'm a silver Emirates Skywards member and need one more flight to become gold. I booked a Flex Plus ticket to upgrade my journey all the way from Kuala Lumpur to Kuwait via Dubai. I had enough miles in my account. The airline upgraded me from Kuala Lumpur to Dubai, but from Dubai to Kuwait they refused to upgrade me, despite being a silver member. Onboard service was slow and not personal. Cabin seats felt cramped and uncomfortable. Onboard food was average. I e-mailed them my complaints regarding the upgrade but they didn't care. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-06;"I flew Emirates from Dubai to Karachi. When I had online checked-in, Emirates had changed the aircraft without informing passengers on their cell no and emails and our seats was different rather then original one allocated.

emirates;2015-10-05;"Frankfurt to Sydney via Dubai. From the disinterested cabin crew, faulty entertainment system, lack of refreshments, to the flight delays, we do not have a good word to say about Emirates. Transiting through Dubai is a nightmare. Overpriced food (desperately needed as so litte food is served on board) and undrinkable coffee, and half hour long queues for the filthy toilets. Toilets onboard the aircraft were not cleaned and as the flight progressed more of them became 'out of order'. In over 20 hours of flying, tea and coffee was served twice. When I asked for a cup of tea I was advised they didn't have any cups. All in all a nightmare trip.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-05;"We were looking forward our Emirates experience a lot, since I heard so many things about that company. We flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them, and  the check-in on all airports used was smooth and didn't take us long even though we were economy passengers. Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again. So why does Emirate put so much crew in the cabin if they don't have to work during the flight.  I have to say that the tickets were quite cheap but others who paid more probably had the same experience.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-05;"I found Emirates to be better after an absence of more than 10 years. Professional and courteous staff in BKK, HKG and onboard. Well appointed A380 cabin, good food and service, generous baggage allowance. Last minute changes to my return leg were efficiently handled. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-04;"I did 4 flights with Emirates over a 3 week period and on each trip there was issues. Seats and entertainment was fine with no issues. Service and food horrendous. Cabin crew were rude and only thing they where interested in was how quickly they could dish the meals out. Have put a complaint in with Emirates due to a member of staff 'pushing' my fiancé out the way when letting another passanger sit down. On the way home even though sitting next to the cabin crew station, they wouldn't answer the cabin crew service button so I could buy duty free. Also having to listen to the lead cabin crew staff member tell off her staff was a joke. Avoid if you can.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-02;"Ground staff at Lisbon we're polite and good natured, but they couldn't for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from Dubai to Sydney despite trying for sometime, and in the end I told them I'd sort it in Dubai - in hindsight a mistake. The flight was pleasant enough, although as this is Emirates you'll have to endure Arabic subtitles over your movies. I'm not sure why as an international airline they don't offer non subtitled option. Arrived at Dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. Lined up at Emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. Everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. Next customer service rep was the same, told me to catch the train and waved me away. Walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at Emirates for not being just a little more polite.  I then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a Qantas desk. Got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business.  Excellent, or so I thought - I spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight, even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when I land due to being fresh at the other end. Got to the boarding gate in the lounge, made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late, to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude Emirates Rep! Didn't properly click what was going on until I got to the door of the aircraft where I approached the Qantas cabin crew. The first girl was disinterested, non-empathetic and in the end I had to walk away from her. In the end I got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers (insinuating that maybe I'd made up the story) might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. I was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the Lisbon Emirates ground staff shouldn't have upgraded me. I briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it. So I was stuck where I was - I guess you get what you pay for. I was a platinum FF for 5-6 years now I'm just a gold it's amazing how differently you get treated. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-02;"This is the second time I flown Emirates Business class to Europe from my home town of Adelaide. The check in was courteous when I asked for my luggage to be tagged as fragile. Boarding was swift. My only complaint at this point in time is the lack of lounge in Adelaide, and we had the share the domestic Qantas lounge which was accessible prior to immigration and custom check. That means that I have very little lounge time. Once boarded the plane, welcome drink was served. Personal introduction by the chief purser of the cabin. Whilst evening meal was offered, we were also offered the option of having breakfast or not being woken up. I chose to have breakfast as it was a long flight of 12 hrs to Dubai. The aircraft departed on time. Hot nuts and a second drink was served prior before the main meal. The options and portions were generous. The food choices were tasty. The seats were comfortable, and better with a soft comforter. The IFE choices were great with latest movies available. There was a separate tablet console which made navigation through their IFE system easier. Time passed very quickly and after breakfast, we soon landed. A good meal and good rest made this overnight travel easier. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-10-01;"My wife and I heard a lot about Emirates: new planes, incredible service and even chauffer ride. We decided to try it on our vacation, as there was a nonstop flight JFK to Milan. The van was on time and the fact that the driver farted did not break our high spirits. It was not too hot and an opened widow saved us. At JFK they did not have a separate line for Business class or Global Access and it took us more time than anticipated to get through. The lounge was calm, clean, fresh air, great selection of food and premium drinks. On board we were greeted with Veuve Clicquot and a selection of juices. My wife asked for different juice and it was produced in seconds. The plane looked new with a lot of gadgets. Stewards were very nice and friendly and were only interested in servicing us even better. We were offered a great selection of premium drinks and very good wines. The dinner meals selection was also good, served hot and delicious like at very good Manhattan restaurant. After dinner the beds were made with mattresses and we had a good rest. In the morning, we had a great breakfast. On exit the chauffer was already waiting and the ride to Milan was very nice. All our expectation were exceeded. On the way back there was a separate line for business class and it took us minuets to get to the lounge, where, again, there was a great selection of tasty food and premium drinks waiting for us. A nice touch: the gate was inside the lounge and it took us few steps to get to our seats. I told my wife that I would rather fly Emirates with a layover in Dubai than a direct to Europe with another airline. On the plane we were greeted with a great selection of orange juice only and when I asked for cranberry, had a beaming smile as an answer and stewardess left. Next time we saw her taking drink orders. I asked what Scotch they had, but she did not know what I meant. I asked for whiskey and she offered John Daniels without alternatives. I decided to try something new and was rewarded with Johnny Walker (I think by taste). Contrary to our first experience, to see a stewardess we had to call and wait for awhile and she always came giving the impression that we drew her away from something important. For dinner we had a selection of two wines: red and white and she did not know what a Wine card was. But she promised that her colleague will come to help me which never happened. I can't say speak to food quality, because she brought somebody else's order and I did not have a chance to get mine. No beds. For breakfast I ordered hot beef sandwich which was served deadly cold. When I asked to warm it - beaming smile and it disappeared, forever. We had the imprudence to check my suit in, shortly before the final descent my wife and I asked for it, five times, but tough luck, I got it when all people were clearing the plane and had to change in the airport bathroom. We were out a bit early and did not find our chauffer at the exit area. We waited for about 30 minutes, until I found the Emirates desk where we were told that my ride is waiting for me outside terminal and around the corner. On the way back we left the highway and stopped as chauffer needed to use the bathroom, which, to be honest, was better than farting. We can take any airline anywhere, but we don’t pay a premium for the flight, we pay it for a service. At home my wife asked: ""Emirates again?"" and we laughed.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-10-01;"Very stressful and unhelpful Emirates ground/check-in service overall on my New York to Dubai trip. Chaotic with the limousine service in New York. Really bad reception in Dubai trying to get a hotel voucher and visa through Emirates ground service. Lady at desk gave me a bunch of papers and asked me to go to the bank around the corner, where the papers were stamped. Then I went back to the first point only to be told that there was no need to return I could go through passport control! Maybe tell that, so people do not have to go back/forth. At JFK check in, I asked about an upgrade to first class. ""Sorry, I do not know how to do that!"" was the reply. Maybe ask someone how? After printing boarding cards I asked her again if she could find out about upgrading (Emirates had an upgrade offer for points on the day). She left and came back saying it could not be done - I suspect because she had already given me the boarding cards. Of course it turned out that there were empty first class seats available on the flight. Flights uneventful - but very disappointing overall.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-30;"I love the Emirates A380.  I have been flying Emirates since 2010, 2 flights per year and I have to say that this is probably one of the most stressful ones as of yet. I was transiting via Dubai with Emirates and we left Doha quite late and had to literally run to our gate. We had to be escorted by ground staff just for us to make our next flight. I got to the gate and I was probably one of the last few to get on, which was a relief. I go on really short 5-day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. Not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. Anyway, when I got to the plane, it was quite hectic. DXB-HKG is always mad, I've been flying this route regularly for the past couple of years and it's pretty busy. The staff was not as courteous as before. Seats are standard, but mine would not recline. Not sure if the seat was faulty or the passenger behind me just had really long legs. I have to comment on how the cabin crew looked really exhausted and worn out and we had not even left yet! Uniforms all wrinkled and presence was just sending out vibes of tiredness.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-30;"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent.  Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised!  The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch. I think this is the most relaxing way to travel.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-29;"We expected a lot from Emirates, but were unfortunately a little disappointed on our flight from Bangkok to Venice via Dubai. The crew on the plane was quite unorganised. The meals were mixed up. We ordered two children’s menus and two special meals and we were lucky enough our meals were not mixed, but our neighbors did not get the special meals they ordered. The staff apologised, however this is not what you would expect from Emirates. Other children on the flight got the toys, but they forgot our children (both 5 years old) and they were very disappointed. Afterwards we had to ask stewardess to please give them something - so later they received the entertainment set. We were quite disappointed with crew services. The entertainment system was excellent, the variety of movies, music you could choose. Wi-Fi was payable.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-28;"Customer service is really lacking on Emirates. The food in the main cabin was awful, dry and tasteless. The stewards are not very courteous either leaving another bad taste in your mouth. On the flight to Bangkok, I tried to purchase two duty free items but was denied when I produced my driver's license and credit card. According to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless I signed my card. I told him that for safety reasons I do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. The 3 stewards made quite a scene because I refused to sign my card. After a while I simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. They all left mumbling to each other. On my return flight from BKK I showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. The staff at the counter told me I was only entitled to one bag and I would have to pay for the other. Of course I said no problem expecting a reasonable price. To my surprise the representative quoted me over 22,000 BHT for the bag. I told her I was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. She explained that according to my ticket, I have to pay by the kilo per bag. Still in shock, I asked to talk to the manager who was not in any way helpful.";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-09-28;"When I first travelled Emirates over 5 years ago I could not sing their praises enough. However I have just returned from Munich having one of the worst experiences ever. After moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work, I was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. I was seated in 48J between two obese travellers and a young woman. As the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. The food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. Window shades were left open when it was sleep time, when I asked an attendant to request it to be closed I was informed ""sorry the man is asleep"". If a plane is going to be 100% full may I suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. On the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before I got a glass of water, I rang the bell but no one replied. I was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear (large laptop) because his entertainment system did not work. At the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant, who removed the garbage bags so I could use it. Waste was overflowing in the restrooms. The worst was being locked into my seat by food trays, left for what seemed forever. The last experience I had like this was with a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down. When are airlines going to realise that economy flyers are their bread and butter and we have a voice. I would rather pay another 15% and be treated as a guest and not an inconvenience.";NEGATIVE

Dubai to Guangzhou on a Boeing 777 - plane virtually full, seat comfort not as good, seats narrow and 3x4x3 layout. Cabin crew efficient but hardly a smile. Flight on time,  but beware of Guangzhou airport, it's very slow to get through, large queues. Inbound from Guangzhou to Dubai 5 days later on Boeing 777, an older aircraft, again very full. Similar hard narrow seat, cabin crew seemed more interested in preening hair and chatting to each other than dealing with passengers. Food quite good, a better menu. Dubai to London on the A380 - on time, cabin crew served a continental breakfast that was very small and unappetising. Lunch followed later - on the menu it looked good, but it was quite poor.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-27;"I recently flew Emirates from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai return, outward in economy and return in business. The difference is remarkable, in that their economy product is actually much better than business, notwithstanding the extra legroom, flat bed etc. The business product food has become unbearably overcomplicated and plain, and more familiar dishes would be much better. Its almost impossible from the menu descriptions to imagine what you will end up with. The age old problem of Emirates running out of preferred choice continues to be endemic to both classes. Wash bags have been axed on day flights in business class, magazines reduced considerably and the DXB lounge shabby (albeit work is ongoing). Queues for the toilets in the lounge are the norm and poor signposting leaves 10s of travelers lost in a daze. Service standards and crew standards are excellent as is the bottom line standard for Emirates but I can't help thinking that with a bit more focus on the business side, they could be back to where they should be - an industry benchmark.

emirates;2015-09-26;"Bangkok to Birmingham via Dubai with Emirates. I have been using Emirates for the past 10 years and the service has gone downhill. The positives are a great entertainment system, good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but that's about it. Nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front -  none of the meals that I have had over the past couple of years have been very nice, especially when you compare the economy cabin food of Singapore and Malaysia Airlines both of whom were excellent. I also find that it depends on the crew if you get attention on your flight - on this flight both legs the crews were not at all interested in the passengers, no water runs were made, you had to ring continuously for drinks and then you were served by a surly crew.";NEGATIVE

Neither of us are tall, but we could have readers and glass cases in the seat pocket and not be bothered. The entertainment system is great : lots of choice and I do like watching the forward looking camera on take-off and landing. The food was good too. Problems are that seats are very narrow, so bumped the neighbour when eating, the food tray is huge - everything comes at the same time, so there is no room on the tray table for wine bottle or discarded containers. Coffee cups are poorly designed, any turbulence and it sloshes out. But overall, for economy, a not so bad experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-25;"A380 business class seat, IFE and onboard bar are still excellent, chauffeur service and Dubai lounges are top-notch. However, the food is quite average with menus remaining the same for several months on some routes. Also, the quality of the cabin staff service be very different from one flight to another. A good choice if seat and IFE are what matters for you.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-24;"Once more some serious differences between these two Emirates flights. From Osaka to Dubai, with a 23:40 departure, dinner was served at 01:30. An old plane, not really a flat seat. Poor drinks and poor food. From Dubai to Geneva, everything was quicker and smoother, nice drinks, food, and a pleasant crew, including a great FA from Ile Maurice. Once more, there is a feeling that there is a second class Business Class on Emirates. Note that ""free"" wi-fi is 10MB, and after 15 mn, you start being charged.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-24;"I was excited to be flying Emirates A380 business class for the first time. Chauffeur service top notch. Seats well-designed, but the film choice was poor. The onboard service was appalling. The problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. Added to which the stewards/stewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no English. One example of cock-eyed service is that my wife and I were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while I am waiting (less patiently) for my pudding. And her wine steward wasn’t permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. Seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. On a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isn't enough sleep time when the airline's gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly. Not a success for the airline which is sad. Will not go Emirates again, certainly not on the evening flight.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-24;"First-time experience with Emirates flying Taipei to Dubai to Chicago, and a very good impression. All flights on time, food was good, and staff very professional. I loved Dubai airport. No complaints and would fly Emirates again. Reminds me what economy class was like years ago. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-24;"I have just returned from a weeks holiday with my daughter to Dubai, flying Emirates from Manchester. The holiday was booked with Emirates including private transfers, and service Emirates provided from start to finish was fantastic. The aircraft was comfortable, lovely food and great inflight entertainment with some new release films. The cabin crew were pleasant and attentive. On arrival in Dubai we were met by a representative, fast tracked through security to our luggage and taken to the awaiting taxi.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-21;"Flight from Adelaide to Dubai on 16 August would have to be one of the worst flights I have taken. The cabin crew were disinterested and disorganised. Seats are very uncomfortable and leg room is almost non existent. The food was the worst food I have encountered on an airline. They did asked if you would like a drink, but you would have to ask exactly what was on offer as no more information was forthcoming. The worst part was the lack of water being offered on board. They came around twice to offer a cup of water and I found that I became very dehydrated. Even though there is a water cooler near the toilets (which I didn't know about at the time) it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as I was in the middle and my companion was asleep. One good thing was the ICE entertainment system. Lots of movies etc, which helped get through this flight.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-21;"Due to non functioning baggage conveyer belt, the departure from Dammam was delayed, resulting in missing A380 connecting flight to Barcelona. Emirates put me in a hotel to wait for the next flight. Next flight was on new Boeing 777-300ER, the IFE screen is sharp, hi-res picture quality, thin and light. I was allocated a seat 24H which is an exit row seat, better legroom. I think a way of saying sorry for the misconnection that I had. IFE system is the best, food is generous. I'd rather less food but better quality. Avoid using Tourico Holidays, a company associated with Emirates, they cancelled my hotel reservation without even notifying me. The first cancellation, I was told to enter my physical address to avoid cancellation. I rebooked thru them the second time with physical address. Arriving in Barcelona hotel, shocked to be told that the hotel reservation is cancelled again, although my credit card was charged (apparently refunded), but no email to notify me that it has been cancelled by tourico. Nasty company. If you want to be stranded in a foreign city without any accommodation. Please do your booking with Tourico. You would see this company, if you purchase your ticket on Emirates website.  A company such as Emirates should not associate themselves with this shoddy company. Avoid Tourico.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-20;"I flew Emirates on EK11 from Dubai to London Gatwick on a full Boeing 777-300. The flight departed on time and after take off, drinks and a small snack was served before lights were turned off. The seat back TV had lots of films and TV shows to watch. About 2.5 hours prior to landing a hot full breakfast was served. The 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow, a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. Cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness. Overhead bins are meant for hand luggage so why do EK allow passengers to board with excessive cabin baggage? I saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase, two bags of duty free, a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers. The passenger seated next to me was one of the last to board and had nowhere to put his hand luggage. The cabin crew told him to put it under the seat in front of him, so he had no leg room for the entire 7 hour flight.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-18;"Emirates are getting worse. My latest flight started in Beirut. Check-in was horrible, four different lines of people, no one knew which line is what. Business/First class and economy ticket holders were lining up in the same lines. The check-in staff was shouting instructions and people in the back could not hear a word.  The flight took off almost 45 minutes late, the crew was professional and very pleasant, but that is the only thing positive to say about the whole trip. We landed in Dubai far away from the terminal. Emirates is running out of terminals and gates, so they land their planes some where in the massive DXB airport and then herd you in a bus. We actually got stuck inside the plane for another 20 minutes before disembarking to a bus. The bus trip to the terminal took another 25 minutes with frequent stops all over the airport. By the time the bus reached the terminal, everyone was cursing the airline. Come on Emirates, you were much better than this. What is happening?";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-15;"The A380 was on my route on both sections between Perth and London via Dubai. Great customer service, IFE is great and comfort onboard isn't lacking. I suggest selecting seats towards the rear main deck of the A380 if you are travelling economy. Dubai is a breeze of a connection. WiFi on board for free (limited amount, enough for some WhatsApp coversations) and the meals are great.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-14;"I really want to like Emirates, the whole concept of their strategy is excellent but the execution is another story. The product on 2 flights with 2 very different stories. Check in at HKG was simple, fast and friendly. The A380 was a nice plane with kind and helpful staff. Comfortable plane with decent food out of Hong Kong and kind crew. Only gripe is that I had to wait 30 mins from being served my dinner to then waiting for the drinks trolley on our side - the result left me wanting to eat with wine but in the end had a cold meal with wine, but the wine selection in Economy is pretty good. Flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Gatwick was not so nice, weird food as the flight was early morning, and a crew like they could not be bothered excepting one Korean staff. Asking for an eyeshade as the flight departed at 02:30 from 2 crew members got me okay I will get one, to we don’t carry them but I will look - in the end no come came to help or answer and I had no eyeshade. The Boeing 777 was not comfortable, not as bad as I was expecting but a far cry from Korean Air 777-300 I flew a few weeks earlier. The mileage points, after London to Seoul and Hong Kong to London, all I earned was 4400 air points! And the endless annoying pointless announcements in at least 2 languages but more if you are flying to a country with a differing language. I also found it quite arrogant how when you watch the flight map you must listen to the ramblings from the CEO on how amazing they are and the merits of the Emirates Ideals. Connecting in Dubai can add a lot of time to your trip, in this case about 5 hours compared with direct. I will try to go with Qatar Airways or Korean Air as a first choice, but not that Emirates will care as their flights are always full.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-14;"I changed my Emirates flight to a late flight departing Athens at 22.20 and arriving into Dubai at 03.50, because there was First Class offered on this extra service and according to my reservation the aircraft was a Boeing 777LR with closed suites. The morning of my departure I was disappointed to find that the aircraft had been changed to an A330 with only sleeper seats. I have never traveled on an Emirates A330, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. On boarding the aircraft I was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats, in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare. On top of that whilst there was many empty gates on arrival at DXB we were places on a stand far away from the terminal. Again another sign that Emirates have no consideration for the comfort of their passengers.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-13;"Amsterdam-Dubai-Bangkok with Emirates. A380 airplanes are impressive, although the services at both the airport and onboard flights leave room for improvement. The staff did not really provide personal attention. The IFE system was the best I have seen in an airplane, and the Wi-Fi service, only 1USD for 500mb, was usable most of the time (for services as Whatsapp, not for general browsing or videostreaming). The food was average to good, but on all flights the crew already ran out of one menu before reaching us.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-12;"I was upgraded from business to first on both my Emirates flights SYD-DXB and DXB-AMS. Excellent private suite, great seat, superb wines, and very professional and friendly crew.

emirates;2015-09-11;"Copenhagen to Melbourne via Dubai. CPH-DXB was operated by one of Emirates oldest B777-300ER. Friendly checkin at CPH but flight delayed by 2hrs. Got a call in the morning from skyward desk informing of delay. Shared Lounge at CPH not bad but crowded. Cabin crew good but not excellent. After arriving into DXB 2 hrs late, was taken to remote stand which was at far end of airport. Thereafter a much dreaded 20-30 minute bus journey to terminal. This felt like we were driving back to CPH. Baggage was already there before us. Dubai to Melbourne left on time, which is rare with heavy traffic out of DXB during morning rush time. Service onboard again not bad. Newer A380 aircraft with better IFE, but food was terrible. Early arrival into MEL and was out in 20 minutes of landing. ";POSITIVE

We got a two at the rear, which meant no stranger next to us. The flights were almost full. The service attentive and fast enough considering it was nearly full. Free drinks throughout the flights. Food was lovely, I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food and it is suitable for most Western palates. The in-flight entertainment system is miles better than British Airways, who I flew last time. The channel Relax TV was a nice new addition which I don't think they had last time.  The screens aren't great in daylight (they never are), but they are fine at night. The headphones and other bits you get are also a step up from other airlines.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-11;"Melbourne to Moscow Domodedovo via Dubai. Checkin in MEL handled by Dnata, staff aloof and unfriendly with attitude. Lounge good and good selection of food. First Flight on an older A380 showing signs of ageing. Eventhough Emirates boast that they have a multinational and multilingual cabin crew, most are more keen on how they look than be of service. IFE is excellent as always. Food is another story and is pretty bad now. A far cry from what is said in menu. The second leg the Purser was rude and made impression he would rather be somewhere else. All this said, Emirates is not bad and does fly out to many places and with seamless connections via DXB.";POSITIVE

Being bumped from our reserved seats on both our return trips, even though my seats were confirmed. I complained on my first two flights and they assured me that my return flights were safe. Well they weren't. They bumped us again. I am disgusted at the Emirates attitude. I won't fly with them again. Choose a different carrier you will save yourself some grief.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-07;"Out of Budapest and Warsaw Emirates have very old A330-200 planes which should have been retired years ago. In business class the AV system is old and the seats are not lie-flat and quite uncomfortable. I'm 6ft 2ins tall and my feet don't rest on the ground when I'm sitting in the seat. It's quite tough to sleep in these seats. In Dubai Emirates park the aircraft for these routes at the outer reaches of the airport, so a 20-25 minute bus ride from the terminal to the plane is normal when arriving and departing from Dubai. The last time I travelled they loaded the business class passengers on the bus after all the economy passengers had left. The ground staff then left us sitting with open doors in the bus terminal for about 15 minutes next to three other buses, all of which had their engines running while they waited for the last business passengers to arrive. Despite all of this, the onboard staff are lovely, and on this route they have apologised about the plane. Emirates seems to be operating a penny pinching service to Central Europe but advertising it on the basis that it's the same standard as the rest of the network. Overall if you can get a budget price for this route then it it may be worthwhile, but if you can avoid paying a premium to fly on these Emirates routes as you will be disappointed.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-07;"Cape Town to Manchester via Dubai in Emirates economy class. On time and great in-flight service. Enterainment system also one of the best. No issue with check in - all handled smoothly and good boarding at Cape Town. As others have said the Boeing 777 has narrower seats and aisles - not a problem for me, but does reduce the quality of the flight for some.  Food, I ordered special meals which came as requested and okay. In Dubai had to be transferred to and from the planes by bus which lengthens the transfer time. The airport has been built to take more people but seems to be bursting at the seams. Allow plenty of time if you are having to go on the train to and from terminals - it can be time consuming with lots of lifts, walks and then the train trip itself. Easy deplaning in Manchester and immigration and baggage claim there efficient.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-06;"Flew Emirates London Gatwick to Cape Town via Dubai. Good check in, good fast track and lounge. Boarding yet again a mess. Complaint to purser. Suite 1K, well trained on board staff and excellent purser. Food and drinks so so. Problem was family of 2 with 6 kids were running around and making a lot of noise. I'm not sure IATA allows these number of minor/children in such a small cabin. Talked to the purser who then talked to the father and things were a little better for a while. Could not sleep. Connecting in Dubai was a mess like the many other times I have transited there. Premium membership and fast track with this airline makes no difference at all, priority wise. Transit is a mess, problems with trains between terminals made us walk forever. A real unfortunate laugh. Second leg, with an 11 month old baby on board in the same cabin was crying non stop for 9 hours. The whole experience was a mess. Cabin staff apologetic but of no good to me. Bag on time but what two vile legs in first class.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-09-06;"I flew Emirates Johannesburg to Dubai, and guess the flight comfort depends on the type of aircraft and how many passengers are onboard. In my case I was quite lucky. No queues at the airport, security, immigration and check-in went very fast. Onboard there was enough legroom space, large interactive screen with an amazing selection of entertainment and movies. Internet WI-FI on board 500 MB for just 1$, decent meal. I was on an aisle and no one was sitting next to me and this added some comfort of course. Staff was courteous and prompt. I have to say that for an eight hours flight in Economy class this one wasn't bad at all, I'd say excellent actually.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-09-05;"Sydney to Christchurch with Emirates, which was a codeshare flight with Qantas. Flight delayed by 2.5 hours due to late arrival from Bangkok so instead of departing at 9.25am, it wasn't until after midday. However, made up time in the air arriving at 4pm. Once in the air, service was excellent. Seated in 21K, in the last row of the front economy section, up against a toilet. Toilet was no bother though. With headphones, you hear nothing, and no smells. 3x4x3 seating with good pitch. Seat recline was great and I had no issues with reclining as no one behind. Good selection of entertainment options. Warm moist hand towels given upon departure. Menu with two choices. Food plentiful for this 2.5 hour flight. Flight was not full. Many seats spare. Seat beside me was free as it was for many seated on outside rows. Arrival into Christchurch was at a time when Emirates is the only international flight. So processing fast. Bags on belt within ten minutes of disembarking. From landing to airport exit was 15 minutes. Really good. Christchurch Airport is the best international airport in New Zealand. Apart from delay, it was a great flight.";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-08-29;"I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was appalling. The crew strutted around, barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. They ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized. On boarding, my 5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food all over it. I asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. When I asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said, ""You only get oreo cookies as dessert with a child's ""economy"" meal"". First off, I had paid $4000 per ticket for our Business Class tickets so the concept of ""child's economy meal"" didn't arise. I will never fly them again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-26;"It's such a shame for the incompetence of their ground staff in johannesburg. I've never seen such shambles in my life. We were flying with our two 8 month old twins and 10 year old son. When we got to Johannesburg airport we already done online check in so just went to check out bags in. We waited right in front of the queue for a half hour because staff didn't know what they were doing then finally we got helped, it took the women another half hour to just check our bags in then she got all worried then told us she made a massive mistake, she put the previous passengers name tags on our bags so she had to change all the name tags. However, 2 bags were already sent down so she said she will go and change those tags. We quickly went to say goodbye to family and rushed through because we were running late due to the bag situation. While standing in the queue for ages at passport control one of the staff came and shouted at us because we holding the flight up I explained to her it was due to their incompetence we were late not ours - she rudely rushed us to the gate and saying one of our bags is at suspicious bags because there's a toy gun or aerosol can in it - neither of those items in it. When we got to the gate 15 mins before departure we were rudely spoken to by the other staff saying that we were kicked off. One of the staff members walked us to get our bags and out of departures lounge to rebook our flight. Then they realise that they put our tags on someone else's bags so two of our bags was missing, and other passengers wouldn't have their bags either. After 3 hrs of trying to locate our bags they finally decided that they think that our bags were on the flight to London. When rebooking our flight for the next day, they wanted to charge us an extra £500 per adult even though it was their fault we missed our flight. After speaking to the supervisor she said the only thing she can do to help us is only charging us a no show fee that was still £160. The next day got to the airport they said they've got us on the stand by 13:50 flight to Dubai so we will have 9 hrs transit in Dubai. When we got to Dubai we had to get our boarding passes for the next flight only to realise then that the staff at Johannesburg decided not to book our 2 infants on the next flight - luckily the staff at Dubai was helpful and helped us to book them on to the flight. The last straw was when our pushchair went missing due to Johannesburg staff incompetence again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-26;"Very comfortable seats, particularly on the Dublin - Dubai B777-300ER leg (the seats had a built-in massage function). Loved the bar on the Dubai-Melbourne A380 leg. Catering was better from Dubai-Melbourne, some of the meal selections did not translate to tasty meals on the first leg. Staff on both legs were exceptional, very friendly, courteous and nothing was too much of a problem for them. The lounge facilities in Dublin could be improved, however the lounge in Dubai was wonderful. The chauffer service was a nice touch and took the hassle out of getting home from Melbourne Airport. The only other criticism beyond the food (which is a small one) is that the flight display didn't work on the Dubai - Melbourne leg. Would highly recommend business class with this airline.";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-08-24;I really want to like Emirates so much but the variable nature of their service just makes the love difficult to give. It's the whole experience from check in at Sydney (the agent was very grumpy about my baggage being 4kgs over and did not like being told that as a Qantas FF I was well within my allowance) to onboard where the crew were nice but just lacked polish. It's a case of Emirates having expanded so swiftly that their staffing standards are haphazard. Small things such as bags with linen from the crew rest area being dumped at the back of the main deck - Just not a good look. Emirates fly from Sydney to where I need to get to globally but just make it difficult to love them.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-23;"We left Heathrow at 10.15pm, due to arrive in Dubai around 8am, so this is an overnight flight as I see it. So I didn't understand the logic of serving us a full dinner an hour into the flight and then breakfast 2 hours before landing. The cabin lights only went off for about an hour between these times, so overall it was almost impossible to sleep. When we checked in online we (couple with toddler son) were not given 3 seats together but the staff on the ground at LHR managed to talk someone into moving so we ended up together. Service on board was okay, but not up to the standards I have experienced in the past. Overall though, I cannot recommend this airline and flight for this route - if you are staying in Dubai you have had no chance to sleep and therefore you are going to have to manage 2 days awake in a row and probably not have a chance to enjoy your day in Dubai.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-23;"Boarding was fine but we were standing around with no info given as to why we weren't moving. Left 20 odd minutes late but flight time to Melbourne was an hour short so that was good. Emirates is a really good airline for flying with children. But overall I was underwhelmed with the service - indeed it seems to be getting worse each time I fly this airline. Food delivery is a bit erratic in terms of timing, and the steward serving hot drinks passed us by twice. Going to Auckland it was announced we were descending. We hadn't received NZ arrival cards, which are rather long to fill out, so I asked a passing steward. He seemed surprised by the request and I pointed out that everyone else would need one too. So a few minutes later he came round with some - but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. Then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down (to fill it out) while we were in descent. This was really poor - surely handing out landing cards is a pretty basic function - they were handed out straight away going to Melbourne. We had breakfast twice - just before landing in Melbourne and again after taking off and it was pretty much the same both times. Bad luck if you don't like mushrooms or baked beans. Overall disappointing and, if going to Europe again, I will look for other options.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2015-08-19;"London Heathrow to DXB in Business Class on the A380. If business class was purely about the comfort of seating and the layout I would give Emirates 10/10. However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a Bahrain to Dubai flight via Doha, I was accustomed to high standards of service. The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot. Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy.  I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. The food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish. I have had better, personal and quicker service in A380 economy where a crew is bound to serve more then 300-400 passengers. I do think I would appreciate a more personal response and attention then a standard we are sorry to hear of your inconvenience and regret the same.

emirates;2015-08-18;"This review is about leg 1 (Boston to Dubai 16th August) of my travel from Boston To Kochi (India) via Dubai. I traveled with my 2 year old son who is in autusim spectrum. I had a car seat with me, so that I can seat with some comfort. None of the crew members in the economy class knew how to fit the car seat in the airline seat. They kept saying that car seat fitting is responsibility of the passenger.  What kind of training they got not knowing how to do a simple task. Their attitude was rude. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-17;"Nice-Dubai: Terrible check-in, where a staff member rushed after us doubting that we could enter the Business class check-in. She rudely questioned our status, and did not apologize. Nice boarding, brand new aircraft, clean and beautiful seats. Food inedible (beef). Robotic service. But excellent drinks (Veuve Clicquot, great Bordeaux). Late on landing as usual in Dubai. Lounge in T3/B is ugly, but food was ok. Showers too small, much smaller than at T3/A. Boarding to KIX completely chaotic. Very old aircraft, worn-out seats, but excellent food and a fantastic crew, smiling FA, always ready to help. Very unusual on Emirates. Poor drinks however.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-15;"Everything was perfect, except  Wi-Fi and Connectivity. If you're going to have Wi-Fi on a plane, you need to make it so that you can load a page. It needs to be faster, otherwise there's no point in even connecting to it. Everything else was brilliant, unlimited food.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-14;"The Check In at Heathrow was entirely disorganised. We were on EK6 and at 7pm when arrived at check in there was an overlap of EK4 passengers in one queue and the rest in a separate queue leading to the main queue. There was no organisation to know who was on which flight and which of the many queues to send them to. After taking 1 hour to check in we finally finished. The Aircraft was fine, relatively new and everything worked well with a friendly crew. However the flight to Colombo via Malé was on a 777-300 (NON ER) which was very tired and featured the old ptv screens which were half broken. Also many passengers had the same seats on their tickets which was extremely puzzling for everyone as they were all re-arranged. Overall a very dissapointing service from a once good airline thats got too happy in reels of money.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-14;"This was my connecting flight to Zurich from Singapore. The flight was on time and the A380 was equipped with the newest IFE system. The new economy class seats / IFE screen as well as the lavatory were clean and new, made me feel welcomed onboard. The meal was tasty and crews were responsible. We arrived in Zurich on time.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-14;"I flew on EK088 to Dubai for my connecting flight back to Singapore. The aircraft arrived on time. However, due to engine problems, our flight was delayed for 3 hours and I could tell that many missed their connecting flights. At that point, the airline and the ground staff settled the problem efficiently and provided passengers with refreshments. No one was desperately asking for reasons and were in an orderly manner. Unfortunately, I missed my connecting flight to Singapore. The airline booked me on the next available flight and offered me free accommodation in Dubai airport. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-14;"Flew on EK404 from Dubai back home. The legroom of EK's newer 77W was adequate, Departure was on time and the flight was completely full, as many of the passengers were continuing to Melbourne. However, despite so many passengers, the friendly crews managed to serve everyone well, the meals were tasty and the onboard wifi costs only $1 for 500MB. We arrived in Singapore on time. Emirates is definitely my favorite airline and i will choose to fly it again next year.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-13;"I flew Emirates to Zurich (ZRH) via Dubai (DXB) on 11 June 2015. Even though my IFE system was not working, the cabin service was impressive. I arrived at the gate pretty early before boarding, approximately 1 hour before gate opens, the aircraft arrived from Melbourne on time. As theres nothing much to shop or dine, I decided just to wait at the gate and talk to the EK crews. (The aircraft layover in SIN was 1.5 hours before continuing to Dubai). The crews were friendly and I felt welcomed for the journey. We took off 18 mins later than schedule. It was a 7 hour night flight. When we flew over India, it got a bit bumpy but the cabin crews frequently came and checked on me and offered drinks and light snacks. We touched down at Dubai International airport 19 mins earlier than schedule. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-11;Our flight from Bangkok to Dubai was on the newer A380 and was half empty in Business class. The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great. I am vegetarian and I was struggling to find anything on the menu. I ended up having just a starter and dessert. They were both tasty but I am surprised that they did not offer any main meals without meat.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-11;"I have flown with Emirate a number of times over the last few years, the latest being in April 2015. In many ways they are a good airline, but for vegetarians they are absolutely appalling. Despite always ticking the box for vegetarian lactose (ie. including dairy products) I am only ever served vegan food. This is extremely unsatisfactory because I am not a vegan. At breakfast time when everyone else is eating a nice cheese omelette with hash browns and mushrooms, I am given some horrendous dish of tasteless potatoes. I am absolutely fed up with the dreadful food served to vegetarians on every Emirates flight I have flown. I am dreading my next flight with them in December.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-10;"The cabin on the new Airbus is lovely. Comfortable bar and lounge area, excellent seats with your own personal mini-bar. On these facilities I have no complaints. My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw. They are inefficient, unorganised, rude, and left me in no doubt that I will never travel Emirates Business Class again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-10;"Emirates is not your ordinary airline, in that it has one of the most extravagantly decorated cabins, from the LED stars to the fancy bathrooms to how their IFE works. It's also worth noting that they seem to fly the plane at maximum operating speeds at all times. It's a nice thought that we matter more than fuel savings. Food was great, seats weren't superb, and cabin service was satisfactory. Being a frequent flyer on Cathay Pacific, I can say that they provide far better service in terms of the cabin crew and frequency of meals. IFE had a very wide suggestion, and worked very smoothly, it's nice of them to leave a volume setting button on the remote even when announcements are being made. Unfortunately Emirates really falls short on seat comfort. I love the 777, it's great, but a 3-4-3 seat configuration is not. The seats felt narrow and sort of claustrophobic. I still hate the layovers though.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-10;"After the long awaited flight to Paris from Sydney we settled in to our flight which included our two girls 5 and 8. The first flight was an early morning flight out of Sydney and it soon became apparent I was going to be let down. The new A380 is not so new anymore, the seats didn't work properly, the plane as a whole looked tied. The food, well for us it was just ok apart from the frozen salad but the kids food, awful. Absolutely terrible. Now I'm not suggesting for a moment my kids aren't picky when it comes to food, but this was terrible. Pasta that was cooked days ago and reheated. Well they tried to reheat. It was either was frozen or cold. The bread was also terrible. The cabin crew on the first leg were great and up to Paris also great but on the flight home from Dubai to Sydney. They weren't interested. They basically bitched how tied they were for the entire trip. I'm back in London in October, flying Etihad, lets hope for a better experience.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-09;"Would avoid flying with Emirates if possible in future. Too many members of staff that were rude. Customer service staff poor in Kuala Lumper, one senior member of staff even answered his mobile whilst talking to us without apologising. Service inflight was slow and disorganised, not enough children’s meals despite reserving beforehand. The only thing that impressed me was the limited Wifi connection we had, but won't be long before other flight operators offer this service.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-07;Great business class seat on the A380. Nice well rounded cabin crew. The lounge is fun. Worth the money. I have flown Emirates on the 777 which is not as good as the A380. The plane really creates a experience.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-06;"I flew Karachi to Dubai with Emirates on 5th August 2015 on a half empty aircraft, only 100 passengers and it was not pleasant flight. One of the male Emirates pursers was very rude on the entrance of the aircraft, not welcoming the passengers. Inflight staff had no eye contact and food standards were poor. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-06;"Overall we found flying with Emirates a very pleasant experience. LGW to Dubai was on Airbus A380 - comfortable seats (although the IFE wasn't working on my seat which was disappointing and it wasn't rectified by crew even though I asked them twice). Food quality was good and generous. Transit at Dubai was a bit long winded having to change terminals but fine as it was a short transfer time. Dubai to Male was very comfortable - service was marginally better on this leg. Return journey, Male to Dubai again on B777 (which was noisy) but again comfortable with good service. Breakfast was good in terms of quality. Dubai to LGW - transit was ok, although the boarding gate was too small for the number of passengers - no where to sit. Flight was pleasant with very good service, comfortable seats, quiet aircraft, IFE and good quality meals. Overall - better aircraft, service and value for money than European carriers. Only downside was transit at Dubai which is a bit of trek.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-03;"I flew Emirates for my first time recently. Having read reviews talking about how great they are and reviews about how cramped their 777 is, I was sceptical. My flight was quite cheap to book ($~650USD). Be warned however, that if you are not flying to or from the US, luggage rules are stricter. If you fly to/from the US, you receive 2 x 20kg bags, otherwise, it is 30kg total. This forced me to spend $350USD on an extra 5kg of luggage, which was quite a hassle. Despite the availability of business class seats, you can only upgrade with points, not cash. The flight was fine, the flight attendants are very sweet and helpful, and the food was some of the best I've had. However - food and drink service takes at least an hour to be delivered, leaving many people finishing their meals before receiving a drink. The seat was pretty standard, I had an empty one next to me, which helped. An inch in each direction would be great. Emirates saved money on the 777 by fitting 10 seats across instead of the usual 9, this leaves very small walkways, and tightens the seats up a bit. However, I'm 6'3"" and didn't have too much trouble. Just be aware, the seats aren't anything to write home about. The ICE entertainment system was good, but a bit jumpy and laggy. Otherwise, ok selection of movies. Unfortunately, my flight didn't have WiFi installed yet. Lastly, the scheduling of the flights seems silly, the Dubai airport is flooded with people at midnight. Emirates should rethink their scheduling system.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-08-03;"I have become a loyal Emirates traveller over the past year with short hops in and out of Saudi Arabia on a regular basis and retained Gold status. However, this flight reminded me why I do not rate Emirates for longer haul. Flight was a hour late leaving due to slow loading of cargo and then we missed our take off slot. Drink service came 1.5 hours after take off and food started 1 hour later - but took nearly 1.5 hours to get out all courses. By this time we were 2/3rds of the way into the flight (so if we had wanted to sleep forget it) and by Dubai time (my starting point) it was gone 4pm. Food was a starter of tiny piece of smoked duck, mains were something with rice and since there were a lot on non-Chinese on the flight I think in business class there should have been another non-rice choice. My main was two tiny bits of skin covered in tasteless red gunge which was supposed to be sweet and sour chicken plus something that once may have have been pak choi but was so waterlogged it clearly had drowned weeks ago. Totally inedible. About an hour later they offered us a snack - it was barely an hour since lunch - it all smelled awful and what I saw of it was not worth touching. Sorry, Emirates, next time I fly to the Far East I will check out Qatar and will remain loyal as before to BA for London/Europe/States despite their old planes.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-02;"The 2nd leg of my wife's and my return flight from the Seychelles and a discounted upgrade into business class. Apart from relatively comfortable and spacey seating, nothing special. Friendly staff, but the three-course meal was served and cleared much too quickly, forcing us to eat our food much faster than we would have in economy, and making the beginning of the flight not relaxing at all. The food itself was ok for business, but not much better than in economy. Entertainment great as always. After all - only the seating justified the upgrade.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-08-02;"Overall we found the experience disappointing. The seats were average, the WiFi was fine (10mb for free) the entertainment system had a good variety of programs, the food was ordinary and the service was indifferent (on our return flight one of the stewardess's was incredibly rude) although the ground staff in Dubai were fantastic. This is the 5th time we have flown this route and have had far better experiences with other airlines (Singapore, Malaysian, JAL and Saudi)";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-28;"Flight from Cape Town was late into Dubai due to traffic parked at a different terminal to the connecting flight but at a remote spot. Had to use stairs, then a 15 minute bus ride then a train ride into chaotic terminal 3 with no help at all to get to the gate. At least 20 on the arriving flight had to run for their lives to get to our gate on time. Was exhausted and not even a minute to have a drink in the lounge. The A380 great after the 777. At Heathrow waited an hour at the carousel for the luggage. No help from any Emirates staff only one bag out of three had been loaded in Dubai. They should have sent someone to the baggage reclaim to advise as there were quite a few people who had no baggage. When we got through immigration the Emirates car had left us stranded. On the return the Dubai leg was good but a repeat of the first leg the Cape Town flight parked miles away from terminal 3 and boarding was total chaos. Lugging your overnight bags up stairs I thought went out in the 60's. No amenity bags on the Heathrow - Dubai was told that if the flight is under 7 hours and in Daylight that's the new policy despite the fact you paid a premium for the ticket. I think Emirates has grown way too big to cope or care about their customers and they can't cope. Transfers between terminals in Dubai are a most unpleasant experience.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-28;"Great flight from JFK to Milan. The aircraft is new and roomy. Lots of great entertainment to watch on the widescreen seat monitors. Seats were very comfortable. We were seated by the galley, which unfortunately, was a little noisy and was hard to sleep, but other than that, I can't wait to fly Emirates again. One of the better airlines I've been on. Our return flight home a couple weeks later was also a really good experience. Thumbs up to Emirates! (at least to this particular plane and route).";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-07-28;"The flight was delayed in Vienna. After boarding, I felt very cold due to the A/C being turned to extremely cold. I was told that the WiFi would work on this flight, however, the truth is that it didn't work. When I arrived in DXB, I had to pass through another Security Gate to transfer. The ground staff worked so ineffectively that there was a very long queue. The airport was full of people and it was very hard for me to get to my boarding gate. The second flight was from DXB to CAN. When boarding, I found that there was water leaking from the luggage rack. No air hostess came to deal with it. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-28;"The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, escorted to our suites, individually addressed by name. The suites are excellent and the facilities great, especially the ICE entertainment. The shower is out of this world, we both had three each. The business class bar has a good selection of drinks and snacks, the bar staff being particularly friendly. The first class bar is self serving again wth snacks and rolls,and a great selection of spirits. Not forgetting the dining, silver service with an option to eat at our own convenience. Choice of food excellent, accompanying wine and champagne first class. ";POSITIVE

Flight to Dubai, excellent entertainment but slow inefficient service with only one stewardess per trolley resulting in trolley being left in aisle if she had to go and get something from galley. Due to travelling with a school group that had to travel together onward flight to Delhi necessitated a further 24 hour stopover in Dubai but at least in a decent Hotel. Night flight to Delhi on 777 with much better service. Entertainment system good but not to the standard as on 380. Return flights same story, quick efficient service on 777 slow and inefficient on 380.";POSITIVE

B777 issues: No drinks served for three hours, inefficient and desperately slow food services, no non Halal meat option, frugal with alcohol and some stewards were rude. Emirates music now confined just to exit of plane thankfully! Positives - painless and efficient transfer at DXB, video on demand allows you to skip advertising at beginning, smooth flight and landing.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-25;"This was my first time trying Fly Emirates and I was disappointed. When we first arrived the plane's AC was off and everyone was hot, not to mention a 1 hour delay for departure. The cabin staff were not cooperating at all. My mother needed help with baggage and the hostess told her to do it herself. We ordered water and tea countless times until they finally responded, the inflight entertainment in my opinion is not good. There wasn't enough variety in the choice of food. When we bought the tickets they advertised it as a plane that has WiFi, which was not the case. The plane was old, the seats were tiny and not comfortable at all. The cabin manager was very helpful though and listened to our complaints and was one of the few reliable people in the staff. Definitely not going to try it again.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-22;"The Emirates 777 is a disappointment compared to it's A380 services. The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out. Cabin service was generally of a high standard and meals provided were one decent and edible meal and a snack. I would fly with Emirates again, but at this stage I'm not sure what the fuss is about.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-21;"We were disappointed with our recent Emirates flight. On our return from Paris were were informed of a 6 hour delay but without any explanation. During the delay were were provided with a voucher for one drink and one cake! When we eventually boarded it took over two hours to get a meal let alone a drink. My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce. Yes, the aircraft are new and the IFE ok but the attitude of the cabin crew doesn't match. They appear surly and unsmiling as if us paying passengers are an inconvenience. We encountered the same issues with the cabin crew on our outward flight. All in all a very disappointing experience.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-21;"We are an Australian family of four, that just returned after spending a month in Europe. We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help. Won't be flying Emirates again!";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-20;"We left Kuala Lumpur on time on our flight to DXB. The aircraft was slightly cold, and had no wifi. As it was night time most went to sleep, I went to sleep for a few hours.

emirates;2015-07-16;"Last month, I traveled from JFK in New York to Milan, Italy. I only have good things to say about my experience. First of all, the plane was huge and the seats were comfortable. The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much.

emirates;2015-07-16;"Excellent, the first class private cabin offers mini bar, snacks, pyjamas, good amenities, excellent staff, amazing food. The new Dom Perignon rose is a really good idea. Had a very good sleep on a comfortable flat bed with plenty of space.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-15;"I was onboard EK345 on 1/7/2015 from KLIA to Dubai, departing at 9.30 am (Malaysian Time). Emirates has generally good service but I must say that the service provided by staff will supercede all other aspects. I believe a customer may forget if the landing was not smooth, the food was delayed or not to required taste, the departure slightly delayed etc etc. A rude or arrogant staff member however will be remembered and customers may reconsider their travel experience with the said airline. Again, I will rate Emirates to have given my family and I fairly good service. But I was very much upset with one of the cabin crew. I have observed harsh tones in dealing with customers in particular those elderly and who may not be proficient in English. ";NEGATIVE

Cabin crew were consistent with service, this is rare on DXB-Asia flights I have exerienced in the past. The flight was a bit cold, bring a jumper for Boeing 777-300ER flights because my returning flight from PVG-DXB on 13th July was also quite chilly. Flight from DXB to LGW was also good, however this A380 hadn't been refurbished as some of the others have, so the monitors were quite slow to respond to touch commands which was annoying.

emirates;2015-07-12;"Brilliant flight as always and Emirates is known for its very comfortable flights. However, I truly feel that Emirates's standards have notched down a bit as the cabin crew are not that responsive to economy class passengers. Moreover, I had to ask for a glass of water about 5 times which is unacceptable according to Emirates standards. I am a frequent traveller of Emirates but this was not a good experience in terms of service provided. On the positive side, the seats were extremely comfortable and inflight entertainment was superb with movies from all over the world and very fine podcasts!";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-10;"This was without question the worst Business Class flight I've ever undertaken in my life. Flight was QF8765 a code-shared flight operated by Emirates on 28 June 2015. Flying with Emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences, with the inflight service either being excellent or completely sub-standard. In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning. Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket). Inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. We reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system, however this never occurred. Upon leaving the aircraft at Sydney I reported the incidents to an Emirates ground staff CSO who was on the aero bridge. We never heard from him or had any follow-up from Emirates at Sydney. We wrote to Emirates, however with any correspondence to the complaints / complements team at Emirates there was no reply.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-10;"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-09;"WAW to TPE and back. Journey was pretty good. I was little bit upset about DXB airport terminal 3. Maybe it was modern and clean, however ""duty free"" prices had nothing in common with ""duty free"". Good thing is that Emirates provides a free-meal coupon if stopover lasts more then few hours. During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me  was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW. Emirates is really proud of its system, but in that plane there were just few channels to choose instead of whole system. Moreover, quality of monitors was far from good. Very surprising. Emirates biggest strengths are luggage weight limitations, punctuality and professional staff. ";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-09;"Generally good service, but my screen console wasn’t working. I told the hostess who said she would reboot the screen. Twenty minutes later after nothing had happenedI told another hostess who said exactly the same thing. Neither returned to check if the screen was working. The third hostess I asked if I could move to another seat with a working entertainment console. This was arranged but should have been done much earlier on when I told them it wasn’t working. I don’t think the quality of their entertainment consoles are that good, something I have noticed on other flights with them. This experience confirmed that. The seat pitch seems particularly narrow. If you drop something on the floor you can forget about trying to pick it up. I'll fly the whole way with Qantas next time.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-09;"Bangkok to Dubai, 4 July, EK373, A380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. The inflight service was some of the worst I have experienced and my expectations are pretty low! Nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. I would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. Crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. The only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45. All service requests in our section ignored and a number of other frustrated passengers mystified as to what was going on. Plane arrived on time but to a stand well away from the terminal. Buses, delays and a transfer that felt like we were driving from Abu Dhabi to Dubai.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-07-08;"Very efficient booking and check in. Very good value for the money. All flights on time and excellent entertainment choices inflight. Meals were ok, not great. The only complaint would be that the staff were grumpy most of the time. Service level of the female staff was below any acceptable level for any reputable airline.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-08;Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-08;"After several Economy and Business flights on Emirates we'd accrued enough Skywards points to upgrade our return flight to First class. Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class. This was 8 hours of pure luxury although I would never pay for it as it's double the price of Business class which is also excellent on the A380.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-07;Flights on time. Arrived in Dubai and stopped a good way from from the terminal. The flight from Dubai tracked through the South of Jordan to about Cairo and then to Madrid. This avoided the troubled area in the Middle East which was comforting. The available entertainment range is truly huge.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-07;"I have flown Emirates many times and the experience depends on how full and/or the attitude of the crew. This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-07;"BRU-DXB on Boeing 777-300 in Business class. The check in was good,  and you get a fast pass through security and passports. They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway. The flight was good with good service from the attentive staff who knew our names and occasionally stopped to chat. The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area. Both flights were on time and you get a fast pass to avoid the long queues at passports in BKK and your bags have priority so will be out before you. And Emirates provide a free chauffeur service into Bangkok, we had a nice Mercedes.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-06;"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat style so I slept this leg but my son stayed awake and enjoyed the Hennessey XO.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-04;"Check-in took over an hour at BOM, despite the best efforts of the ground staff. Boarding was done in sequence and the ground staff ensured passengers didn't get away. Smooth flight, excellent cabin crew, comfortable seating, decent food, and loads of entertainment. Luggage at DXB took over 45 mins to arrive. All in all would still recommend Emirates for the flight journey.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-04;"It was a great relief to finally have an excellent crew on this leg. My last 2 flights to BKK return left me so frustrated and very disappointed with Emirates. It's a shame for the airline because when you get an excellent crew, Emirates is a fantastic airline to fly with. Yesterday's crew provided lots of attention towards their passengers. My daughter was in economy on the same flight and agreed on the great service too. Interesting find was that when you book an Emirates flight on Qantas website, the chauffeur service is no longer approved even though it says you're eligible to it! Just be aware.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-04;"CAI-DXB, first leg of CAI-MEL with Qantas but this leg operated by Emirates. Check-in at CAI crowded but done professionally. On-time departure. Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch. Unfortunately at DXB aircraft was parked ages away from the terminal, which meant a 20 min bus ride. Overall, a pretty good experience but still issues with making the Qantas-Emirates interaction feel seamless, especially at check-in and transit.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-07-03;Our flight (EK028) from Glasgow at about 2 left on the dot. The inflight entertainment was great and the meals were excellent! The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Drinks service were often. The seat was extremely comfy and the 7.5 hour flight whizzed by! As we arrived at peak time in Dubai we had to wait a bit. (About 20mins). The following flight (SIN-DXB) was about 3 am and was an Airbus 380-800. We got to the gate as it said gate closing athough we didn't leave for another 30mins. We got served breakfast onboard. The flight was cold at the beginning then started to warm up. We had better inflight intertainment than the first flight we arrived in Singapore at about 15.00 (+5hrs from DXB);POSITIVE

emirates;2015-07-02;"While I did get my value for money, I wouldn't consider flying Emirates again. Ground service at Sydney airport was ok. Check-in was quick and smooth. However, at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. The person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. The plane was clean and quite spacious. The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. During the meal service, the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. Instead, she gave me my seatmate's order (and gave my seatmate my order). Additionally during the drinks service, the flight attendant seem bothered when I asked what tea they were offering. Ultimately I thought the crew were inexperienced, tired and annoyed. This was my first flight with Emirates, and it unfortunately has given me a bad impressions of the airline.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-06-29;"A very bad journey. We took flight from Glasgow to Dubai, when we arrived to Dubai airport our boarding pass was taken away by one of the Emirates staff and gave us new boarding pass without any information given - when we asked them, we have been told that our connecting flight from Dubai to Delhi has been cancelled. The cabin crew on flight were fantastic.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-06-29;"Our flight to Dubai was delayed by 2 hours and Emirates didn't seem to care. We had one notification that our flight will delayed by 2 hours and not a word since. Staff appeared not experienced, disinterested and rather tired to serve. The cabin looked outdated and they run out of specific food although we were seated towards front of the aircraft. When our luggage was misplaced at Dubai airport, nobody had a clue what happened to it or where should we go. Waiting with 3 kids at the airport for over 2 hours wasn't fun. ";POSITIVE

I pre booked the seats and had booked for a bassinet seat and was duly accorded. Security and Immigration was smooth and fast. Aircraft seemed a little old but was clean. Seats were very narrow and had a limited pitch. However on account of us having a Bassinet seat got enough leg room for this short haul flight. The service was efficient, they took the drinks trolley thrice and served guests each time. The selection was food. Food was good but seemed very inadequate for a full grown adult like me. Departure and arrival timings were perfect. Inflight ICE System was good and had good selection of shows and movies, though the remote seemed a bit unresponsive at times. Overall very satisfied.";POSITIVE

emirates;2015-06-22;"JFK-DXB on the A380. Hard product is great, excellent legroom, seats had decent recline and cabin was in good condition. IFE is top of the industry and is the best. Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid. Overall, still a decent flight but I would rather fly with another airline.";NEGATIVE

Ground service excellent and onboard service as well. During the outbound route crew offered snacks and dinner while on the inbound flight dinner and breakfast with snacks again. For every meal I had two option between a fish or meat and both were good. IFE is very nice with a big variety of films, music, documentaries, radios and so on. Seat were very comfortable although I flew in economy class on a 9 hours flight. Crew polite and available for requests by passenger. Outbound flight departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early in New York while inbound flight to Milan rejected take off so we had 40 minutes delay but we arrived in Milan just 10 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.";POSITIVE

Menu has been changed on this route (LAX-DXB), EK listening to the demand of frequent customers. But menu can still be improved. I noticed the entree of Seafood duo was excellent but Seafood duo again reappeared as main, which is odd.  Wine selection is good. Overall menu score is 6/10.  ICE is superb. A380 is superb. Cleanliness and on-time performance excellent. A good flight where I managed to sleep for 8 hours.";POSITIVE

I had a 12 hour layover in Dubai from Addis Ababa so the airline put me up at their airport hotel providing transport and food vouchers. The hotel service was excellent. Emirates has a special area for layover passengers at DXB airport that have a layover of more than 8 hours. DXB to YYZ was full and crew were very busy. A380 has an excellent entertainment system which has many movies in CC .This is an extreme plus for me since I am deaf. The washrooms were cleaned. The food was excellent with ample choices. Lots of snacks with an open bar! The seat was comfortable even though a fellow passenger hogged up part of my seat territory. There was WIFI but I did not use it. Fellow passengers said that it was spotty. Crew fantastic, cheery and chatty with the passengers. They answered the call button when people used it. Smooth take off and extra smooth landing.

The aircraft condition was good, clean. Good flight entertainment but I hope they update the selections. The food is so-so because the bakery were served cold (croissant and bun).  The cabin attendant were friendly at first but maybe due to a long flight, they get tired when we were about to land, plus with that little kid. Overall, my journey was not the memorable one. It was because of negative things but not with good impression.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-06-19;"My first experience flying long haul (London-Sydney) with Emirates in conjunction with Qantas, and  it has been a really frustrating experience not least an unpleasant one. Right from my 24 hr delayed flight to the customer care or the aftermath of my family vacation to the way both Qantas / Emirates handled my complaint and the treatment has been appalling. Qantas passed this fault to Emirates (operator) and Emirates blamed the airport ground staff for the delay due to a technical fault! Qantas wesbite is not very clear as there is no email contact available to directly liase with whoever's handling my complaint or customer care department. Customer service email is no longer in use, according to the automated response to my online complaint. ";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-06-18;"Generally, this was a very good trip. If I ever have an issue with Emirates, it is delayed or missed connections at Dubai airport, but on this trip all went to plan.

I've been doing this route (or one to Birmingham) regularly for over 2 years now and appreciate the consistency of the service. The A332 Muscat-Dubai is rather old but who cares for a 45-minute hop, but service is still very good. I also had a free upgrade to First to go with one from Manchester to Dubai on the outward journey, so I guess that increases the feel good factor! The leg to Manchester on an A380 was perfect.

emirates;2015-06-16;"I have traveled on Emirates airlines since it's inception in the 1980s when I was a resident of UAE. My husband and I were very excited to become a part of the Emirates airline family once again when the routes to Asia from US were introduced. I flew the SFO to India (Bengaluru) route for the second time in 18 months last month (May) with a stop over in Dubai for 2 days. I received an e-mail confirmation 24 hours prior to my travel time. However, when I arrived with my 7 year old daughter at the airport to check in 2 hours prior to travel time, I was informed that our seats had been given away. I had even requested and reserved specific seats for our family 2 months prior to the travel date over the phone with an Emirates customer service representative. We had to wait 30 minutes and were then given 2 seats to travel to Bengaluru and then were made to rush to the gates to make the flight. I was informed by the agent who was checking me in that my seats were given away because I had not checked in online! I told her that I had received e-mail confirmation just the day of travel, confirming my seats and now I was being told that online check in was necessary to ensure getting seats to travel. Our family travels all the time in several different airlines and have never heard of online check in being required to confirm having seats! We had to deal with this same stress once again upon our return journey from Bengaluru at the Emirates check in counter. This time I had confirmed all our tickets online prior to travel as suggested. However, when we were ready to check in our baggage, we were told that my husband's seat was not available and they could not seat us together. We had to wait for 20 minutes and insist on getting the seats that we had requested and wanting to speak to the supervisor before we were finally given the 3 seats together. Once again, they said that they had to hold our seats as the flight was over booked and full. I fail to understand how this can happen to any passenger traveling on an international flight who had confirmed tickets 2-3 months prior to travel date! We arrived on time as per schedule at the airports both the times to check in luggage and followed standard Universal airlines protocol. There was no apology for all the inconvenience and stress that was caused when we were finally handed our boarding passes. The agents at the counter made it appear as if they were doing us a favor by being able to give us boarding passes and seat us together. It was very disappointing to experience all this by traveling on supposedly a World Class Award winning airline.";NEGATIVE

I had two sets of headphones and neither worked properly. Attendants seemed constantly harried with poor time management skills, although they seemed to find lots of time to have a group gossip in the galley at the back. On the Dubai-London leg the young man in the window seat near me as getting wet from an overhead drip originating in the air outlet. When he asked politely if he could move he was told curtly no he could not, even though there were spare seats. Just before we touched down in London there was announcement could the five gentlemen who should have been travelling to London Gatwick make themselves known to cabin crew. How can the Emirates staff let people booked on a London Gatwick flight get onto a London Heathrow flight? We had a good laugh about that one. ";NEGATIVE

Complete opposite to the previous times I've flown with them. The crew were superb, chatty and greeted passengers with welcoming smiles. During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there. I shall look forward to flying back with them next month. I highly recommend.";POSITIVE

The problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in Rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in Dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in Dubai! I have called Emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do. We are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day, have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. Very disappointing.

They also have changed their menu on this route a welcome initiative after goodness knows how many years the previous menu has been served on the route. The mediocre part of the trip: Service quality difference between the multinational cabin crew. Some goes the extra call of duty being very accommodating some gives you the impression that they wish to be elsewhere one stewardess was just unpleasant - I do not need to justify my second request for a burger as the serving was minuscule as a mid-flight meal. Mid-flight desert was excellent. Breakfast main sounds appetizing on menu - poached eggs turned up rather disappointing the termed boiled is more appropriate the accompanying Salmon Potato Rosti was soggy rather than crisp. Overall a disappointing plate that is just so far from its description in the menu. Lunch menu prior to arrival on the other hand is excellent. Seared Tuna loin on edamame is a welcome change to the rather boring Arabian meze. Shrimps served with polenta is a welcome option to the permanent features of the menu the plain old steak and Indian inspired dish. Dessert is excellent. Menu on this route still needs to be perfected and I know Emirates can do this judging from quality of meal/wine on board of other route (SYD-DXB).;POSITIVE

Both flights full to the ceiling both flights late by one hour staff obviously over stretched but in no hurry and not one I ever saw smile. Entertainment would have been good as usual with EK except the ear phones I had and changed twice were useless due to the engine noise and two men talking behind me so could hear nothing.

If there were any shortcomings I surely didn't notice it because the only impression I got was that I would be flying Emirates once again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-06-01;11/5/2015 EK 148 AMS-DXB. 15/5/2015 EK 652 DXB-MLE. 24/5/2015 EK 657 MLE-DXB and EK 149 DXB-AMS. We had the pleasure to fly with the Emirates for a trip from Amsterdam to Dubai and from Dubai to the Maldives. It was a very pleasant flight and the service on board was excellent. Looking forward to fly with Emirates again!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-06-01;Flight EK418 BKK to SYD. 2x3x2 configuration. Seat adequate with duvet addition making it more comfortable to sleep. Food and beverage selection limited and food quality just average. Staff very aloof and inattentive. Inflight entertainment was good.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;Auckland to Sydney EK413 28 May 2015. Drink trolley came 15 minutes after the meal trolley. All passengers around me had therefore finished their meal before being provided with a drinks service. Dinner menu offered Beef or Chicken however the option was in fact Fish or Beef? The crew in the mid section of the cabin seemed very disorganised and lacked supervision. I activated the call button and it took 20 minutes to have any attention given and I was not the only passenger in this situation.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding. Come on Emirates do something about this.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;Flew EK725 from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam 19/5/15. I often fly this route after flying from New Zealand and always prefer this older 777 as it consistently has a great crew brilliant service and food/drink. Much more attentive than the huge long business class on the A380's where crew walk for miles to ferry food and drink. I only marked them down on the seat as it is an older one and same for the inflight entertainment otherwise I would rather fly these older planes than the 380's apart from the bar area of course.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;I travelled from Perth to Dubai on 28/5/2015 and from Dubai to New York on 29/5/2015. I thought the food was excellent and the seats were comfortable. The flight attendants on both flights were nice and friendly. Even though both flights were very long they seemed to go quite quickly. I will fly Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;"Travelled NZ to England 3 flights both ways in May. I think their standards have slipped having flown with them several times now. My main gripe is the miserable cabin crew. Hardly anyone smiles or gives eye contact. The food was ok but quite repetitive. We often didn't get to choose the meal we wanted as ""they had ran out"". It's a pity you can't give an indication of which meal you would choose prior to the flight so they can get more accurate supplies. Meals seemed a bit disorganised and drawn out at times and we couldn't believe that they abandoned the last ""sweet snacks"" round after serving half the cabin. We thought the staff were going to get more supplies or we would be served later but no. We got nothing. Then it was time to land with a 3 hour wait for the next connection so we had to purchase some drinks and snacks in the airport to keep us going. Maybe they left it too late to start the snacks round. But again better organisation is therefore needed. The staff were not seen much in between the food and drinks serving unless somebody called for them. On previous flights they often came round with extra water. But this time hardly at all which left us quite dehydrated as I didn't realise till the end you could self serve from a point on the aircraft. This should have been made known to everyone at the beginning of the flight. We had the Airbus for all of the flights which was a great. The entertainment and leg room were much needed on such long journeys. All in all we are keen to try a different airline next time.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-31;May 2015 EK418. BKK-SYD-CHC fantastic as usual. Emirates are my airline of choice and they have been for some years. My flight was on time staff were excellent and there was nothing to grumble about.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-29;BKK-DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB-BKK. First leg BKK-DXB EK 373 was cancelled for 27 hours finally managed to get on the next days flight again the flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. The A380 is a jumbo jet however the Emirates seats are very hard. Your legs will get very sore after 2 hours flight in. Food is so so and the cabin crew are mostly unpleasant or just not willing to help. DXB to BKK sit on the first row right outside toilet a nightmare as you can't sleep at all with a long queue of people waiting for toilet the entire journey. Nevertheless I won't fly with Emirates again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-29;As an avid Qatar airways traveller I thought it is only fair that I write my thoughts on my recent flight from Manchester UK to Islamabad PK with a 3 day stop over in Dubai with Emirates travelling out on 26/04/15 and returning on 13/05/15. Confession this was the first time I have flown with Emirates and not had a major complaint. Travelled with my Mother and 3 year old Nephew. The flight going from here was fairly full but the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The Seating was ok food etc was served on time and they were efficient. They had better inflight entertainment compared to Qatar so my nephew was kept occupied. The food served was very nice. Flight from Dubai to Islamabad was very quiet not many people were traveling so they were able to quickly serve and people were able to sleep in more comfort if required. The return flight highlight for me would have to be the A380 from Dubai to Manchester they had more entertainment for the children as well as the adults. Seats were extremely comfortable cabin crew were really sweet especially with my nephew. I have travelled on A380 last year but my experience was not very good. Only complaint on behalf of the older generation would be the amount of confusion that there was once we had got to Dubai airport due to the sheer size a train had to be caught from one terminal to the other there were a lot of people were very confused about this and I cannot really blame them. However based on the overall experience I would definitely travel with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-27;BKK-HKG-BKK trip on EK384 and EK385 respectively on April 1st and April 4th. On the outbound leg boarding was at will. Arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. The cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. They wore dirty shabby uniform. No safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. Rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. The meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. I picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. Cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. On our return leg same story with the meal - I didn't even bother to touch it. IFE screen was frozen on my wife's seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. Headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. I fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying EK again unless desperate. The A380 is an amazingly comfortable plane to fly however EK service was a massive letdown.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-27;AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-27;On the flight to Dubai we wanted to Fly Business Class but unfortunately all Business Class and First Class seats were booked - so we booked Economy Class on the A380. This was the best Economy Class experience we have had the seats are wide with a lot leg room. Service was great.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-27;CPH-DXB return. Very attentive staff from beginning to end FA's very friendly and well groomed. Having flown this sector previously with QR I can only say the service level differs in the fact that EK staff are less robotic and overly smiley at least on my flights. Would definitely fly with them again.;POSITIVE

emirates;2015-05-27;Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-25;EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-25;Three of us travelled with Emirates leaving Heathrow on 30th April 2015 and returning on 16th May 2015. The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-22;LGW-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. LGW-DXB B777. I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-20;Flight EK207 Dubai-New York May 14th 2015. We boarded the plane with 400 people and no air conditioning on time with no delays. When we were moving towards the runway the plane stopped and after an hour the captain realized there was a technical issue. We were kept onside the plane for 2.5 hours with no food or water. The flight crew were most inconsiderate. It was a madhouse! People were frustrated and angry without any details on what was going on. They finally let us out from the plane into a tiny lounge (at least it had AC). Forget about food or water at this point. 1.5 hours later they boarded the same plane all over again and with total of 4 hours delay we finally took off. We were in Dubai home country to Emirates and the company couldn't expedite the problem with providing us with the new pane? It was my first and my last time with Emirates!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-20;Manchester (MAN) to Dubai A380 and then on to Christchurch (via BKK and SYD) on B777. Return from Auckland to Dubai (via BNE) and Dubai to Manchester all on A380. My first time with Emirates (lots of KLM/AF in last 5 years) and overall a good experience. A380 seats slightly wider so feel more roomy but what gave most space is that with exception of one leg (BNE to DXB) seat next to me was empty. Food mostly OK (one meal was cold) but Emirates choice of meal and times seems odd. (So 10pm flight out of MAN serves eve meal but no breakfast before landing at 7am local time) next flight leaves 9am local time and then serves lunch almost immediately. On the longer legs I miss the 'help yourself buffet' cart that KLM/AF have in the galley. Cabin crew vary a lot huge range of nationalities means considerable variety in service. In A380 it takes a while to get served so your meal is eaten (or left to go cold) long before you get offered a drink. Inflight entertainment is excellent once you've got used to having adverts at the start! Overall was happy with Emirates but didn't love it. I suspect the reason they were cheapest flights is because they do everything to a tight budget and the economy experience reflects this.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-20;Flight EK008 from London Heathrow to Dubai 16 April 2015 Business Class. The seat I was assigned 10D did not recline and was broken. The system was rebooted 3-4 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. Until then I was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting I couldn't use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates. Seems odd and not befitting an airline such as Emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs. Overall as you can imagine this was disappointing for me as a Platinum member flying Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-20;CDG-DXB-KIX NRT-DXB-CDG. A380 / B777-300ER. First time with Emirates with high expectations. In terms of aircraft's themselves not disappointed at all. Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF. Anyway prices keep being competitive so at the end fair value for money.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-18;I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-18;Flew from Manchester (UK) to Dubai on EK20 and then from Dubai to Christchurch (NZ) on EK419 (this flight stops at Bangkok and Sydney on the way. Returned from Auckland via Brisbane to Dubai on EK 435 and then to Manchester on EK17. EK419 is on a B777 with the remained on A380's. Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs. Entertainment system is excellent though it's unusual to have adverts on aircraft. Seats were OK a bit wider on A380. Overall it feels rather formulaic: fine when it all works but with no margin for error.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-11;EK722 NBO-DXB business class Seat 9J. 777-200. NBO airport a total nightmare. Why EK even bothers inviting passengers to its lounge there when it is standing room only is beyond me. I couldn't get out of it fast enough. The terminal was painful particularly the gate area. Once on board not overly impressed with the seat. Crummy selection of newspapers. I was chatting with my seatmate but the privacy divider would not retract which made conversing awkward. We were in the air for well over an hour before I had anything to drink something that would never happen on QR SQ or CX. The lead FA for the business cabin came around asking people how their experience was so far and seemed to be aware of the horrors of NBO airport.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-05-08;I travelled from Heathrow to Dubai and then onto Singapore. On my return it was from Tokyo to Dubai and then onto Heathrow. As far as I am concerned it has been the best airline that I have travelled with. Seating and leg room was more than enough (I'm 6 foot). The food was adequate but how many breakfasts and lunches can you eat? Mine was a total of 8. One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights. This must mean that Emirates change the air filters more often than others.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-06;I have not taken an international flight for many years but before then I travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children (by myself). This trip I flew Sydney - Dubai - Dublin for Christmas 2014. Then returned Manchester - Dubai - Sydney in Jan 2015. I found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. I felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. I went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. It came 2 hours later. The cabin crew were sitting/drinking/eating and arguing. The meal thing surprised me as I had never been hungry on an international flight before. We were fed twice in 14 hours. Otherwise it was as you expect.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-04;I flew PRG-PER and SYD-PRG both through DXB and was satisfied. The staff was friendly and helpful seats comfortable and spacious enough the planes (B777 on all legs except for SYD-DXB which was on the A380) were (or at least seemed) new and the vegetarian meal was surprisingly tasty. Both of the flights between Dubai and Australia were only half-full making it much easier to sleep. The only hiccup along the way was high traffic at the Dubai airport due to which we had to stay in the air for an additional 30 minutes. I also had to re-book my second flight (the charge for this is 99 euro) which I did over the phone in about ten minutes and without any problems. After flying with Emirates before I had high expectations going on this trip and it's safe to say that they've been met.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-01;Flight from ICN-DXB-MAD. Everything was fine except its cabin crew. Some were rude and never smiled. Dubai Airport is awful. It is just a shopping center with zero possibility to see the airport apron.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-05-01;I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though. So same airline for two flights but two quite different levels of service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-28;I flew on 21st April 2015 from Bangkok to London I had my baby with me and was feeling very nervous about flying with her but the staff were so friendly and helpful. When my baby cried they helped me calm her down especially one staff member who saved my sanity he even made me an iced coffee with out me asking. The second flight was not as great as I felt the staff weren't as friendly and welcoming I had the assistance light on for over an hour and no one came and when I tried to wave someone down they would just ignore me. You could also hear a few of them moaning about being tired and hungry which I don't think is very professional. The main thing I would say that was bad was at the baggage claim when the buggy's were the last items to be put round the belt so there was a lot of tired babies and parents waiting for their buggies.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-28;Flight EK225. Dubai to San Francisco. Airbus 380. Pathetic and Rude Infight service. Basic reply there are 400 plus passengers and 8 crew members only. If crew are short staffed is it a passenger problem? Terrible service at baggage claim more than 2 hours. Reason short staff.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-20;On a recent flight EK435 (A380) from Brisbane to Dubai on the 18th of April 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. Resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. Water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off! The Captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the Purser. All in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17+ hours. The food was as usual substandard the drinks as a few have mentioned only appeared after the food was served! I dread the day they are going to launch the new revamped A380!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-19;"Was on the Emirates flight Dubai to Delhi in February. Have done this route several times. They have this weird practice of serving meals before serving drinks which is the norm even on their other flights. It appears like they'd rather not have the passengers order any drinks which are advertised as included in the flight cost. Secondly meal choices advertised on their Menu cards are almost always not fully available - its always ""Oh sorry we've run out of this option so all we can serve is this"" Great - than why offer a choice in the first place. Seats are cramped with lower than average legroom.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-19;Flight from Manchester UK to Dubai and on to Singapore (Boeing 777). Flight not bad at all seats Ok staff very good. Slight delay getting to Dubai but staff were very efficient at helping us to the connecting flight. Good flight back to the UK from Dubai on the new superjumbo airbus Great seats attentive staff nice atmosphere and food Ok. Would certainly fly with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-16;Food quality on board the B777 and the A380 was very poor. I travelled via Dubai to Tokyo and returned to Gatwick after a four night stop over in Dubai. On all my journeys I was either unable to have my choice of menu because they had run out or the meal quality was extremely poor. The cabin crew apologised but said that they could not do anything and that my complaint was quite common!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-14;We recently flew Emirates to Dubai and then connected to Kuwait. The food and service was second to none. When we flew back from Kuwait our flight was delayed. We originally had 1hr and 30 mins between flights. By the time we landed in Dubai and reached the terminal it was 7.20 am local time. Our flight to Birmingham was due to close at 7.30 am! We ran like crazy to our gate A17. By the time we got there it was 7.35 am! We were then told our gate had been changed to A4. There was no way we were going to make it. The guy at the desk phoned through to gate A4 and told them he had 2 passengers and would personally bring them himself. He then picked up my wife's hand luggage and carried it to a buggy. We made it last ones on the plane but would never have without that member of staffs assistance.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-14;Flying to Dubai from Manchester on 15th March 2015 Boeing 777 flight EK022 seat 21e and 21d. We found the service very poor. The female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. We were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. On the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. This was before and after lunch not at a busy time. At lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore I had to ask for milk and sugar. The coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. We have never had this treatment on previous Emirate flights. I wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy. Our return on 30th March was just the opposite with friendly crew and excellent service.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-14;EK 5048 Wellington to Sydney (code share with Qantas) 21 March 2015. EK 413 SYD - Dubai 21 March 2015. EK 841 Dubai - Doha 27 March 2015. Excellent experience on Emirates. Staff service satisfactory meals of good quality and endless amounts of onboard entertainment.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-12;Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and return. My first time with Emirates. Flew economy. 777-300 on all the legs. Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings. Overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-10;Doha to Dubai EK848 and Dubai to Zurich EK087. Both flights were 25 March 2015. Emirates was a great airline but lately its service levels are declining. We took a trip from Doha to Zurich with connection in Doha. On first leg we asked for blankets but no attention was given until flight landed and on reminding air hostess were told that no blankets were available on flight. On second leg the food was quite poor and head phones were collected 30 minutes before landing. Certainly service levels have declined significantly compared to 2 years ago.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-10;I was flying from Melbourne to Warsaw my plane from Melbourne was late and I lost the connection from Dubai to Warsaw. I was pleasantly surprised how Emirates organised another connection to my destination. The staff were wonderful and the food very tasty. On my way home for half of my trip I was allocated to Business Class - no extra cost. I highly recommend Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-08;LGW-DXB-BKK and return. 3 legs with 777-300er and 1 leg DXB-BKK with A380. Overall not impressed. Expected a lot more from the Emirates name. Both journeys no wifi available or telephone onboard as advertised. The screens seems to be a bit unresponsive. Staff lacking the extra mile with far too many announcements unrelated to flight safety really disturbing at night time. Flying just once with Emirates is probably enough.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-08;"Just returned from a 3 week break to Oz Manchester to Brisbane (via Dubai) Sydney to Manchester (via Dubai). Have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Yes the service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew. Yes the meals weren't fine dining yes improvements can be made but if my 4 legs of this trip is anything to go from I would definitely recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good and am looking at booking again for this 22 hour journey with Emirates on the A380. If I were to be critical then improving the food offering would be good and using ""secret shoppers"" to test flight attendants would help I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. Emirates need to be careful with traffic flow as we had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion. In essence I'd definitely recommend the Emirates A380 service safety and comfort are first rate and with a few improvements I'd say even economy is first class!";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;"I am a frequent traveler with Emirates and am sad to say it is all going downhill. MNL-DBX-AMM and CAI-DBX-MNL on the way back. The B777-300 ER is a nice plane with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault) one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have ""Light Bites Service"". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then the connection to Amman was far worse. A330 plane is really bad when the passenger in front of you fully reclines you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding long faces a true mess. Fortunately I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then another red-eye to Manila more ""Light Bites"" service crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then they already woke me up). These flights require super-fast bed service not three hours after. An really can't you afford a true meal? Really disappointed.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;EK 415 SYD-DXB - business class April 4th 2015. Check-in agent was friendly. Flight was on time. The crew overall worked very hard aside from several juniors who seemed to shadow more senior stewardess whom need to polish further their customer focus skill. Food is of high quality (Seared duck as appetizer and steak). I skipped breakfast which was the first meal as I had enough breakfast from the Sydney Emirates lounge which serves very high quality breakfast. Wine on offer inflight is of high quality. ICE entertainment system again the best there is in the industry. A380 that is deployed in this flight is an early generation of the type as it does not have the latest innovation such as electrically controlled window shutters better ICE controller and slightly smaller screen. Overall a very pleasant flight and will meet the expectations of the most discerning flyer. Note to Emirates whomever design the menu/wine list for EK flight to and out of LAX should take note on the menu served in this flight. I got the feeling that these menu are designed by 2 different staff/divisions.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;My husband and I flew from Johannesburg to Istanbul via Dubai in late March 2015. The flights to Dubai and then Istanbul were fairly uneventful. I had requested a gluten free meal. The gluten free portion of the meal was unimaginative and very unappetising. Arriving at Istanbul we waited at least 30 minutes for the luggage to be offloaded. The return trip however was an ordeal from beginning to end. The flight left Istanbul more than an hour late. We had to wait in a boarding area that was far too small for the number of passengers. We arrived in Dubai with 30 minutes to make our connecting flight and were told that we had been rescheduled on a later flight which meant a wait of 5 hours through the night. Our compensation was an inadequate meal voucher. Meanwhile our original connection left more than 30 minutes late in any case and we could still have made it. The new connection also left late by about 40 minutes. My special meal request was not transferred to the new flight. The flight was jam packed and the service was patchy. When the coffee eventually came around it was absolutely cold. I will not be flying Emirates again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;BHX-DXB-BKK 1st April 2015 777 then A380 - EK 0384 and EK 0040. A Tale of Two Cities! The contrast between these two flights was vast so the data below is an average of both hence here is my review for each leg. Leg One Birmingham to Dubai. Plane full seats squashed leg room limited staff mainly rushed and miserable touch screen sensitivity useless. Leg Two Dubai to Birmingham. Plane full seats much larger in width and leg room wonderful attentive staff new screen with light touch sensitivity. No headphones provided to me. The price was £480 return with a return in July which was excellent and was much cheaper than from HRW with a better and shorter DXB layover of 2 hours. Would use again. Two gripes - advertisements at beginning of films and shows annoy me so an ability to just watch 20 seconds of a bit of each film in order to get the gist of it would be great I have no time to wade through numerous adverts just to eliminate 80% of the substandard films. Gripe Number Two yes its the Emirates Music! Great when you only fly them occasionally but hideous when it just goes on and on and on a four chord repeat monotony come on Emirates how about the sound of silence?;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;We have flown with Emirates more than 20 times. In the last 4 months we flew Business Class 8 times and First Class once. We have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. Emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. The crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline (including budget airlines). On 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. Emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. We have flown with Emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. The food in Business Class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. They have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. The food at Singapore Business Lounge was inedible I say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. I returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. The chauffeur service is also highly variable. At Singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van (replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior) instead of the limousine they promise. We fly a combination of Business and First Class when we use Emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. Unfortunately we have found that for 75% of the time we come home feeling frustrated. We are going to try BA and Virgin for our future trips - I would highly recommend avoiding ever using Emirates airlines.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-06;I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium. Poor showing Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-04-04;Emirates A380 is the only way to fly long distance today. We flew from Spain to Dubai and back on it and once you experience the bar at the back and being able to move around drink chat and socialize you will not want to fly any other way than the A380 Emirates Business Class. It sets a standard of luxury that no other aircraft or airline can compete with. They know the meaning of going that extra mile and the A380 is it!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-04;DUB-DBX-PEK and return. Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector. Despite the first let-down Emirates will be my airline of choice for any future longhaul international travel.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-04;SYD-CDG-LHR-SYD. With stops either way in Dubai. Hadn't flown Emirates since 2005 and very mixed reviews but I had to book a trip due to a family illness in England literally booked 4 days before flying and Emirates gave me a very good price. On all 4 sectors I flew A380s couldn't fault them the planes were clean staff were courteous ICE was excellent and meals not too bad and above all the toilets were kept very clean flew in the forward economy section on 3 sectors and it felt very cosy. Keep it up Emirates will certainly fly you back to Italy next year with my wife.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-04;DUB-DXB-PEK and return. First time to fly Emirates. Three flights on the Boeing 777-300 one on the Airbus A380-800. 3/4 sectors typified the renowned Emirates service but DUB-DXB left a lot to be desired with surly uninterested and even some ignorant cabin crew. Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight. However all other sectors were extremely good particularly service aboard the A380 from PEK-DXB. Staff were exemplary chatty smiling engaging and above all courteous. Our group received complimentary champagne on two occasions during the flight. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. Space was very good the IFE fantastic and food was excellent. All in all a wonderful experience and definitely my airline of choice for future International travel.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-04-01;A colleague and I travelled Business Class to Singapore (via Dubai) from Heathrow on our way to Australia and New Zealand end January 2015. Our flight on Emirates proved to be a highlight of the holiday. The crew the food the ambience the comfort was all absolutely fantastic. We travelled other airlines on our tour but none came anywhere near the standards set by Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-30;We flew from Birmingham to Melbourne with stops in Dubai and KL - very satisfactory. Excellent lounges and good departure times so the trip was as painless as possible. Service varied from ok to excellent. Seat 9A and 9B were well positioned comfortable and with good appointments and spaces for storage. Emirates is clearly a top class airline with all the trimmings that a long time traveller expects (for the $$$!). Their entertainment system is a bit hard to navigate. Program selection fantastic.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-29;Traveled on 24th March 2015 flight EK435 from Auckland to Paris stop over Brisbane then onto Dubai. I would of appreciated more move selection the same with the music. 25 mins before landing our headphones were collected. Why? Flight attendants were slow bringing drinks. Flight from Brisbane to Dubai (13 hrs) I recalled them coming around with water 4x. I had to get up to ask an attendant to fill my water bottle because they were too busy talking in the food prep area. Meal selection always ran out by the time it got to the back rows. On our final flight the first meal from Dubai to Paris was served 3hrs into the 7hr flight it was breakfast of what was left over and not everything on the menu. Lunch again was what was left over and too salty I requested cheese and crackers and got told she'd come back after she served the drinks but I got nothing. One of the toilets (Brisbane to Dubai flight) soap dispenser was broken and soap seeped out onto the floor making a huge wet slippery surface. There was never moisturizers or spray in it and there was always one toilet not operational. I paid for a flight that covered all its services why should I be made to feel like my needs are not important. I didn't request extra food or alcohol I just wanted my choices on the menu toilet paper soap spray refreshers and moisturizer in a clean toilet and to be able to listen to good music and get water without having to ask.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-29;DMM-DXB-BKK on March 26 - In Economy Emirates has a solid offering few airlines can match. Crews are friendly courteous. I wonder why these crews are not deployed on the long haul route such as LAX even on Business Class of the same route need crews like this set to work on. For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them. Seat is a bit hard on the A380 however bearable on a short and medium haul flight. I can not imagine sitting in that seat for a long haul 16 hours flight to LAX.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-28;"ADL-DXB-VCE return March 2015. B777-300ERs all legs. First time on EK and must say I was impressed certainly compared to QF long haul. Able to use the Qantas lounge in ADL due to QF status nothing out of the ordinary but you need to allow time to pass through immigration etc at the gate. Boarding started well ahead of time (on all legs) and was strictly by seating zone which worked well and lead to on time departures all 4 legs. I prefer an aisle seat and on 3 of the 4 legs the middle seat was unoccupied. Chose the small Y class section just behind business which was good. I found the seat and leg room good but then I am quite short. Note that aisle seats don't always have power plugs but the USBs worked well. ICE was impressive but the relentless ads got a bit annoying after a while even though you can fast forward them. Service was universally good and friendly albeit with the inevitable slightly ""plastic"" airline feel to it. Hot towels menus small amenity kit. Food was more than adequate on all legs and always got my preference. Trays cleared away promptly regular drinks runs and staff seemed to respond to individual calls. Liked the mood lighting overnight and slept well. Transit in DXB worked well no long lines at security even a peak hours. One bus transfer but very efficient. Used the lounge in DXB - yes its big but just move away from the central hub and there are lots of quiet spots to chill out. All in all I was happy with my flights and would certainly use EK again on these experiences.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-28;I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own. My next trip to Dubai I am going to try Etihad business and I hope that the experience is better.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-28;Flew EK406 - Dubai to Melbourne on A380. I fly on a regular basis with Emirates. However the quality of service is exponentially going downhill. The food on this flight was terrible. Staff service was pretty poor and they weren't really interested.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-27;BRU-HKG via DXB return 1st class. Fab driver pick service in all legs from residence to airport to hotel and back and to residence. A big plus! Check in fast as it should be. Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too which makes it too warm overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess. Non one around and the first class in concourse C is small and not that good. Again boarding to HKG very average and not prioritized as it should be. A380 excellent experience not my first one with them but meals are very average. Excellent ICE. Return on HKG - Dubai leg not so good staff were rude and unpleasant. Again connecting in course C is a mess. Last leg ok. Bag not first out and unfortunately zip was broken and lock missing. To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either. However staff in EK office in BRU helpful and hopefully all will be sorted out soon. Not yet done though. I only fly them 1st class and am a gold member but I will think twice when choosing EK again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-25;EK038 4 Mar 15 BHX to DXB. One and a half hours delayed. No drink service offered for another one and a half hours. Dinner then served without drink meal eaten before wine was served. On checking the menu I hate curry so informed the stewardess asking her to save me the alternative but she forgot so no main course for me. Very stressful flight due to worry about missing connection. Next year it's BA direct for us.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-25;Outward from Heathrow 24/3/15 EK002 to Dubai. Dubai to Mauritius EK701. Homeward Mauritius to Dubai EK704 on 11/3/15. Mauritius to Heathrow 12/3/15 EK001. Patchy service. If you did get a drink prior to take off it was immediately taken away. The seats were not clean. I actually found dry noodles on my seat on one leg of the journey. I had soup and scrambled egg served cold. You then have to sit and stare at your tray for 20 minutes or more after you have finished one course then wait again for the next. The staff are far too busy not enough of them no team work. Have flown Emirates Business Class before and was pleased but not on the huge A380. The only advantage was a fully flat bed but not too much of a bonus when the seats are not clean. Dubai Business Class lounge is like a transport cafe. Too big too few comfy seats too few ladies toilets. All in all not value for money. Awful.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-25;LHR-DXB - Seats spacious and ICE entertainment system excellent with a wide selection to choose from and a very large screen. However most disappointing was the crew onboard as they were very rude and made us passengers seem like an inconvenience. I was expecting a lot more from an airline like emirates in terms of customer service onboard. The food was also quite poor even for economy class.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-19;LHR to KUL via Dubai RT. Business class. Best business seat I've sat in on the A380 out of LHR. Service excellent - pity the meal I wanted wasn't available - and as I was not among the last to be served this was not a good sign of forward planning the catering supplies. The bar at the back upstairs is of course a great bonus!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-18;Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340 DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room so more comfortable.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-18;14/03/15 - Dubai to Newcastle upon Tyne. Business Class lounge very busy with unsmiling staff. Experience completely different once on board. Very helpful friendly professional cabin crew. Nothing too much trouble. Great level of comfort and ICE entertainment superb. Well done Emirates!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-18;I regularly fly Emirates from LGW-DXB-MNL and return. I have never had an issue until my last flight from Manila to the UK. Arriving at Manila for check in found that the flight was overbooked and Emirates were asking for volunteers to give up their seat. As a Silver member I was advised that I would be upgraded to business class for the MNL-DXB leg of the journey and all seemed well. The service on this leg was great meals were excellent and the business class cabin was roomy and comfortable. The only downside with this flight the entertainment system which wasn't working in Business class for most of the flight. The second leg from DXB to LGW was in economy class and this version of the 777 was very cramped much more cramped than previous Emirates 777 flights. Service was good though when trolley service was completed they struck the arm rest with the trolley breaking the headset plug leaving the prongs embedded in the socket. This resulted in the rest of the flight with no sound for entertainment system. Arriving in London found that there were issues with my baggage.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-17;Flew Kuwait - DXB and DXB - Doha. Food drink and inflight entertainment is only what we can dream about on a short hop in Europe. However the crew were absolutely miserable. All of them. The crew also made no effort to enforce safety. During taxi there were people wandering around the cabin without being challenged at all.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-17;QF8423 27/2/15. Perth-Dubai - business cabin. (Qantas partner). Beautiful lounge with excellent friendly service. Plane clean and smart with seats/flat beds very comfortable. Nicely appointed well decorated cabin crew helpful attentive and smiley. Food although not exceptional was more than acceptable and service was first class. No complaints whatsoever about the flight. The problems began at Dubai. Very busy so held before landing. Dumped at least a 20 min bus trip from terminal. No information of where connecting (Qantas) flight was departing from. No one in terminal to ask. Inserted boarding pass into state of art machine that was supposed to tell us where to go - it didn't. 15/20 min fast walk to train to change terminals. Rush to gate and just made it as gate was closing. 4 people at least didn't make it and had bags off-loaded. This was simply not good enough. Took the edge off the whole Emirates experience - such a shame. Would imagine this problem will go once airport finished! Would fly Emirates again but would in the meantime ensure at least 3 hour transfer time. Qantas booked this connection not us.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-17;MAN-SYD and return. Couple of slight delays on take up but the airline made up the time and managed to land close enough to schedule. A380 all the way which is excellent because the business class cabin allows every seat to have direct aisle access so no stepping over your neighbour. Excellent storage and your own little mini bar in each seat. Bar at the back of the plane is great for taking a break on the 14 hour leg from Dubai to Sydney. Food good and IFE the best.;POSITIVE

Over the years Emirates have squeezed economy (or cattle class) as much as possible. Sometimes the behavior of the crew is surprising. Food is good however the overall service is okay only. Given that Qatar and Etihad now flies out of Dallas I will avoid Emirates in future.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-17;EK010 LGW-DXB was on an A380. The plane seemed very new with nice entertainment system and it was updated with the latest IFE system with a 10 inch HD screen. Seats were comfortable with lots of space to straighten your legs cabin crew were nice and friendly and food was delicious. The next flight from DXB-BOM was on an outdated B777-300 seats were quite old including the IFE system but the content was almost the same cabin crew were not friendly they seemed to be in rush all the time food was ok. On return my flight from BOM-DXB was on a B777-300ER and that was another plane with much more better seats and IFE system compared to the one I had from DXB-BOM although the service was nice and cabin crew were better with no rushing. On the A380 from DXB-LHR the plane was the same but the seats and screen of the IFE system were the same as the B777-3ER although the whole flight was nice was a bit disappointed with the system as the one I got from LGW-DXB was new. Will fly again with them.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-09;Flew from KUL-DXB-LHR and return. All flights were excellent. Flight was almost full on A380 to and from London but rather empty on A380 to KUL. Flights depart and arrive on time great IFE good food and attentive staff.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-09;I travelled from London to Dubai EK006 by A380 aircraft on 30th July 2014 and Dubai to Dhaka EK584 by Boeing 777-300ER on 31st July 2014. EK006 was excellent the food was great the entertainment system and the service was fantastic! EK584 I sat on 40A in the back cabin of the aircraft there were empty seats but only the window seats are full. This means that I had the whole row to myself to rest my legs and sleep properly while lying down! EK584 was the best flight of my Emirates trip!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-03-09;"EK 10 on Jan 4th onto EK 770. Noticed that 25% of passengers received a drink before take off. Crew too busy to serve all of us. No drink service for the 2hr 27min. Each request met with ""it will be along shortly"". I realize that is why so many regular business travelers dashed to the bar before the seat belt signs were switched off. The meal was still cold when I mentioned this I was told that ""it had been dealt with in accordance with instructions and we are very busy"". It is very obvious that Emirates do not carry enough crew on the A380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. Make sure that you are not at the back! The next leg of the journey on a smaller plane was far better. They just did not bring the luggage.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-04;EK 385 I have flown BKK to Jeddah twice in the last month and on both occasions misted my connection in Dubai. There should be a 2 hour connection time plenty of time for the connection. On both occasions the Captain said that due to a heavy load of aircraft at this time in the morning we would have to hold. Will give Qatar a go next month as Emirates can not get their act together.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-04;Flew as a package Heathrow to Dubai Dubai to Colombo Colombo to Male Male to Dubai Dubai to Heathrow. On all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. We actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. After 3 days in Dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane so ours had been sold to someone else. We waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in Colombo. Desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait no seats available anywhere on the plane. After 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasn't a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold Dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. Got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. We did get a voucher to travel from Dubai to Colombo! How this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. The only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. We did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations. Never got a reply.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-03-04;My advice would be to avoid Emirates until Dubai Airport improvements have finished: too many planes have to park out on the apron meaning 30 minutes extra until into the terminal delayed baggage and rushed connections. Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers). Hope they return to previous high standards soon.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;Flew Chennai - Dubai and back. Both flights took off and landed on time clean interiors and great in-flight crew. A wide selection of movies and other programs on the in-flight entertainment system. The quality of food served was also good and no one was refused an extra drink. Overall a very good experience.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;A380 London Heathrow to Dubai 777-300 Dubai to Dhaka. A380 leg was comfortable food OK crew efficient. 777-300 Dubai to Dhaka - plane full cabin crew unenthusiastic - had to wait over 90 mins for food and a drink a drink should at least be served earlier if the wait for service is so long. Return leg Dhaka to Dubai 777-300ER plane again full. Cabin crew better and more organised but food was extremely disappointing-so called breakfast was a sloppy curry alternative was fish. Seats on 777 are cramped and narrow. Dubai to London Heathrow A380-nice new plane seats more comfortable and cabin crew pleasant organised and efficient. Cabin crews seem very variable too many need to learn to smile.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;Flight EK148 AMS-DXB on 7/2/2015 in business class. Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384 DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385 BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015. Again an uneventful flight with food less than mediocre. FA's acceptable. Flight EK147 DXB-AMS. The best of the four legs. FA omnipresent and very friendly. Food was good. The waiting times when changing flights in Dubai made traveling quite tiring. I think it will remain at this one experience with Emirates when travelling to South East Asia.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;Flew EK 408: KUL to MEL on B777. Service was excellent! Welcomed with hot towel. Food was great. Staff was efficient. Flight entertainment was absolutely excellent. IFE screen was wide and large. The ICE widescreen was just great. Passengers was given access to front and bottom camera allowing those who sit on aisle sit to see what happens outside the plane. Powerpoint and USB port was available and I could charge my mobile phone! Plenty of films/TV show in multiple languages. Cabin was clean and the mood based lightning was synched to the skylight outside the plane. Staff were efficient and helpful.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;Flew SIN-BNE in J class on the 77W. This is my second and last flight with EK in business class and I had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. This did not happen. The crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. They missed our welcome drink and I had to ask for ours as they collected everyone else's empty glasses. Then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. A drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours before we were offered our first course. The fun started trying to get a glass of wine. They do not serve wine automatically with the meal like other airlines and instead walk around with a type of wine rack with a few glasses on it. Good luck getting their attention to get a glass. They walked past us three times while we sat looking at them expecting a glass of wine with our entree. I was served red but my partner was ignored. I rang my call bell and they arrived to see what could be wrong with me. A few minutes later the same FA walked past offering bread and no wine. At this point I lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. My partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. Eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. They had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. It was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. The food was very average quite boring. To me this airline just lacks soul. The IFE was good and the ground staff at SIN airport and the lounge were delightful. Just such a disappointing onboard experience.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;"My wife and myself flew from Glasgow to Sydney return January and February 2015 on economy. The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state ""due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served"" OK if you were business or first but economy forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us ""its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this!"" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told ""you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only"". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-24;Flying Perth to Manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip (facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg). On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service! Hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a 'sleep' of approx 3hrs not worth the effort. For the cost of the ticket was not impressed with the lack of ground service or apologies for such a long delay one would think they would be more organised as this must happen regularly.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-18;HAM-DXB-NBO and return. HAM-DXB on the B777 very modern aircraft good seats. DXB-NBO on the A330 return B777 slightly older but good compared to several other airlines. Seats are good on all aircraft's plenty of legroom. Inflight entertainment probably one of the best in the world there is a big variety of Music Movies tv series games etc on a big touchscreen. Food is good (both quality and quantity) and I really like Dubai airport even though it is rather large. All flights on time. Really nothing to complain about great value for money!;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-18;My husband and have just returned from our holiday to Sri-Lanka and Dubai. We used Emirates on all four flights. We were very happy with Emirates except for our return flight home from Dubai. The service was not what we had previously experienced with the airline. We were some while into our flight when our first meal arrived clearly there was some delay with this meal as our next meal arrived within approximately an hour. It all seemed a little chaotic. We appreciate that the cabin crew worked hard and were very busy throughout the flight however during the other three flights in a two week period the service was excellent. We have flown with Emirates before and have received very good service so we're disappointed.;POSITIVE

emirates;2015-02-18;Flew Manchester-Dubai-Singapore and returned three weeks later. Going out OK but remember much longer journey than with other airlines you also have to change planes. Service in past has made this acceptable not any more will I be doing it. Earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. Return journey was a nightmare. Plane full and a seat in front that came so far back I had trouble opening my tray. The guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that I had no room. Monitor did not work for three hours so they reset it three times before it worked. Seatbelt was falling apart. Toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. Water dispenser also was not working. Second meal before landing not served. I was already unhappy from first leg. Second flight was from the other side of the airport a good thirty minutes dash never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. Dubai to Manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. Problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. We sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. We eventually do set off. Leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. No answer as yet. I have travelled with Emirates over the years many times I will not be doing so again service is no longer there.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-18;Flew from Birmingham UK to Dubai on 27th January and did not enjoy the experience. Cabin crew were terrible. Half the plane received a hot towel before takeoff and then the crew could not be bothered with the rest of us and abandoned it. Dinner service was dreadful. The rows behind us received their food about an hour before we did but then they had to sit with their food trays for about another 2 hours before being cleared away. It was 3 hours in before we received our first drink. Finally the menu said we would get a hot drink and sweet treat before landing - nothing given. The crew were so slow it was unbelievable. Flew back from Singapore yesterday via Dubai and could not believe this was the same airline. Yes we all got given hot towels and again before landing. Very prompt with food and drinks and was a pleasure to fly with them this time.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-11;I flew SIN-DXB-BHX after spending New Year in Singapore. I cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. I have been flying EK since 2006. Transit in Dubai - Dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. Terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for EK but why no aerobridges provided. My flight departed SIN at 01.20 landed at around 05.00 in DXB. EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-11;LHR-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. Four flights in a A380s in a week. Service was slick and professional but there were signs of cost-cutting. Some of the meals were excellent and other mediocre. Boarding the flights was a relatively anarchic process. There were two specific problems that were drawn to my attention by the cabin crew. The first is that many of the business passengers had apparently been upgraded from economy because Emirates had overbooked the flight. This meant that the cabin crew upstairs were working extremely hard and were perhaps not quite as happy as they normally are. The second was the build quality of the A380. For instance two of the four bathroom doors at the rear of business were faulty on a relatively new aircraft (A6-EEN) and according to the cabin crew there were quite a few other similar issues. This is of course not necessarily the fault of Emirates but quite a lot of passengers seem irritated when the light failed to come on it one of the bathrooms and the door failed to shut in another. It never ceases to amaze me that having been building bathrooms in aircraft for many decades manufacturers still haven't managed to work out how to design cup dispensers that allow you to take one cup at a time or tissue dispensers the release a single tissue rather than a handful. That said the cabin crew were assiduous on all of the flights in keeping the bathrooms clean. The flatbed seat was extremely comfortable especially with a mattress although sitting towards the rear of the aircraft meant that there was a constant matter of closing doors from the galley. The OnAir Internet works fine for the LHR-DXB leg and enables you to download your emails (assuming no large attachments) for free because it starts charging at 10MB and even then is not overpriced. However on the return leg it did not appear to work at all. GSM also worked at the cabin crew reminded passengers to keep their phones on silent to avoid disturbing people.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-11;I flew from Muscat to Geneva via Dubai with my 3 children. We were overall very disappointed with the quality of the service and the staff attitude onboard. Air hostesses were rude staff made us wait for our hot meals as we refused a menu we had not requested on the way back special meals were not edible! T3 in Dubai is unpleasant and not set up to host so many people and planes (30 min bus journey from the plane to the terminal).;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-11;EK412 and return on EK413 Sydney - Auckland return. A380 in business. As usual lounges both ends were luxurious spacious and comfortable. There is no doubt that the window seats on the upper deck are absolutely fantastic. Big screen TV private and comfortable. Outbound to Auckland the service was very slow and I only ate breakfast 20 minutes before descent. On the return flight no such problems. The bar is a nice touch and usable unlike similar products on 777's. The quietness of the 380 is unbelievable especially for travellers like me that cut there teeth on DC8's and 707's.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-11;"BKK-SYD on a 777-300ER. Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.";POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-06;BUD-DXB and DXB-BKK in January 2015. The first leg had good service light meal with tasty food. Entertainment with small touch screen several movies and medium selection of music. On the second leg I flew with the new A380-800 a very nice and spacious plane more legroom large touchscreen a huge number of movies music games. Disappointed by only one meal also not very tasty (chicken changee). Back from BKK to BUD with the same type of airplanes this time two meals from BKK to DXB. All flights in time polite staff and good service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-02-06;In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-02-06;BKK-SYD on a Qantas codeshare flying Emirates 22/1/2015 arriving SYD 23/1/2015. The service was great. The food delicious. Ample reading material and the ICE entertainment provided more than enough distraction but the seat was too narrow and uncomfortable and the overall ambience felt cramped.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-28;"Last October I flew from Amsterdam to Jakarta through Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost 'bitchy' and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. Between Dubai and Jakarta they use a Boeing 777. Another disappointment! The plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. The entertainment screen was small and old (my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of Emirates) supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. Different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. From Jakarta to Dubai we flew again with the 777. Same complaints as on the way to Jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in Dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. We had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs weren't designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. When I asked the crew why we didn't taxi to the terminal the reply was ""there is no available gate"". This is the home base of Emirates and there is no place for its own planes? From the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. From there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building. For my girlfriend and I this was the first and last time we used Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-26;RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-26;We flew A380 to Dubai then 777 to Bangkok. Both flights on time. Loved the A380 it was so spacious we sat in row 88 at the back. The A380 was really quiet too. The 777 felt more cramped and was not as comfy. The IFE is brilliant both touch screens. Finally the food. We fly long haul twice a year but the Emirates food is by far the best we have had. Can't wait to fly with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;Series of Trips on EK MEL-CMB-MEL and CMB-CAI-CMB. All sectors in Business except DXB-CMB which was in First. Check in Good. Lounges not bad. However the quality of food in DXB has been going down over time. Good Welcome on Boarding. IFE is AVOD and excellent as always. Staff can be hit or miss mostly a miss. The quality of meals on board keeps going down every month. Bread basket is brought around only when you are nearly done with the main. Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water. Depending on how much you pay for ticket it is still value for money. But EK is on a steep downward spiral. And if you have any comments or complains post flight and write to their customer service desk do not be surprise if you get a watered down response which is a border line insult.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;DXB-Seattle J class. Overall good solid experience Chauffeurs on all legs were on time and pleasant. Flights on time. Lounges as usual in DXB good with great offering of food and beverage. In Seattle you had to ring a bell and a man would appear from behind a curtain to give you a drink (obviously economizing) no food. Crews on outward leg helpful and professional. Crew on return looked bored and tired and no smiles. Overall good experience. Business with Emirates is I feel is generally a solid product.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;LHR-DXB-BKK Economy. Check-in pretty efficient in T3. The flight was full (as usual) with Emirates and left on time. The A380 is much quieter than the 777 but there's not much difference in the seats/space. Cabin service on Emirates is variable depending on the crew and this one was OK - nothing special. Economy food has improved recently and quite tasty. Good choice of drinks and frequent water/juice runs. On time into DXB and A380's park at the gate instead of remote stands which makes connections easier. I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK. The cabin service in Business was nothing special and I prefer to eat in the lounge rather than on the flight. Good IFE - there's always something worth watching on Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;The flight from Hamburg to Dubai was two hours delayed and service on board started 25 hours after take-off. I pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a Stewardess came by switched of the service sign and went away. I pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. Furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. Food unfortunately below standard. The Entertainment System was quite ok though. Hope that I don't have to fly with Emirates again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;FRA-DXB-BKK-DXB-FRA. Must take EK again for the flight to Bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. FRA-DXB on A380 nice aircraft-flight full but still roomy DXB-BKK on B777 did not get the selected seats (even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on EK Tool) EK has changed our seats and we did not sit together/flight full - no more to say about the 3-4-3 seating. Worst service of all sectors slow service we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. BKK-DXB-FRA on A380/B777 flight full our choice of foods ran out on every sector. I've flown Emirates over a period of six years and I can definitively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares (if booking at least 3 months in advance) can be competitive. However EK progressively gets worse. EK is still on cutting back massively on quality example no amenity kits for Y class foods (quality and quantity) is getting worse cutting the Skywards-mileage counts too small number of cabin crews in Y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service avoid service to passengers disregards the calling sign. Very chaotic and very slow on board-services choice of foods ran out very early no organization. All those bad on board services EK fare is no more valuable for money. Only IFE is the best.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-23;DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-21;We flew in August 2014 from Rio de Janeiro - Dubai and Dubai to Shanghai. We travelled with 2 children (3 months and 26 months). On our first flight the toddlers TV was broken so he used my husbands and mine couldn't be used as we had the bassinet for our baby. Staff were friendly though. One our second flight my seat didn't recline I was promised at the start of the flight that they could manually do it after the meal was served so I thought that was reasonable after the meal however they told me it couldn't be done I would just have to accept it. So for an 8 hour flight I sat upright with a baby on my lap as he wasn't allowed to use the bassinet most of the time because of turbulence. However our toddler slept in his aviation approved car seat that their telephone service agents said we couldn't use. I think their customer service needs improving they tried to tell me I needed to buy 2 seats to use one car seat for a toddler whose seat I had already purchased. However at the airport everything was ok due to a nice customer agent who was able to place all our family together when again customer service had placed us all separately. The airline didn't live up to the expectation that we had and we fly long haul several times per year.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-21;Flew from DXB-KUL. Flight was onboard B777-300ER. Everything from boarding until touch-down was excellent. Friendly and attentive cabin crew excellent IFE comfortable chairs fine meals smooth flight and the experience was excellent. I would definitely consider flying Emirates economy class again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-19;We were a party of eight travelling to Male via Dubai on the 20 December 2014 for two magical weeks in the Maldives. Going out had a 3hr stopover in Dubai which was changed to 3hr 40 minutes Our return flight times were good leaving Dubai at 2.35pm. 5 week before we were due to travel we were advised Emirates had changed their flight schedule meaning our flight from Male did not leave enough time to transfer the luggage from one flight to another. The only option we were given was a 12.5 hr delay or return a day early from our holiday We ended up using Dubai connect which was not good experience. We paid quite a bit more to go with Emirates than another leading airline. Never again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-19;LHR-DXB-PER-DXB-LHR. The trip out to Perth was almost a tale of two different airlines. LHR-DXB on the A380. The Heathrow lounge is dull and there was little sign of staff. It was not made clear that boarding would be straight from the lounge. Once on board a welcome drink was proposed but never arrived. No amenities kit was offered. The plastic bags they put the headphones etc in look cheap and nasty. The much-vaunted wireless IFE controller would not unlock from its dock so not much use. 3 different cabin staff said they would deal with it but nothing was achieved. Meal service was unduly slow. No drinks served (as promised) before the end of the flight. The promised Dubai gate information on IFE channel 94 didn't materialise. Yes it was business class but it was all very impersonal and irritating. The toilets are just by the bar area so if you are queuing you are mixed up with the bar clients - not a comfortable arrangement. DXB-PER on a B777 was totally different: perfect service and everything worked. PER-DXB the seatbelt adjuster didn't work and couldn't be fixed and they eventually cobbled something together with an extender - a bit embarrassing to be presented with that in front of other passengers. Again the IFE controller didn't work. We got to the Dubai area on schedule then had to hold for 40 minutes due to congestion. When we landed we were parked at a (very) remote stand which meant a long bus ride to the terminal. Terminal 3 is enormous and impersonal and there was no time left to do any duty free shopping. DXB-LHR was ok. The IFE controller didn't work - again! So all in all I'm not that satisfied with Emirates. There seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I've flown LHR-PER once a year for the past 10 years and have used Qantas Singapore Malaysian and Qatar all in business class. I'd rank Emirates at the bottom of this list. It'll be back to Qatar next year.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-19;Whilst I noticed the narrower seating (Being 777) on my way to London (Emirates) I was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say I am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that I am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London) legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this! Will try and check out the plane-type before flying again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-19;Flew on their B777-300ER for a short trip to DMM. Aircraft was far more comfortable than the older 777-300s. IFE was pretty much best in class however I did not find their meals particularly great. Decent airline overall but definitely slightly over hyped.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;I flew from Dubai to Mumbai on EK502 on 1st Jan 2015. I had a confirmed internet check in with seat numbers allocated. When I arrived at the counter I was told that they were over booked and I had to defer my flight. They informed me that the confirmed check in was not valid till a boarding pass was issued. I had to wait until the boarding time before they called me and offered a seat right at the back of the plane and not the one I reserved at time of online check in. Looks like they don't honor their online check in system.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;This was my first time with Emirates and did not find it worth all the hype and pricey tickets. Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight. At one point it took them more than an hour to collect our plates after we finished our meal. Food was okay nothing great or exceptional. In- flight entertainment was the only best part about the flight screen is great plus they have a good collection of movies etc.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;DFW-DXB-BOM: Booked Emirates as it was the cheapest and got a very good deal. The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it. Food was very good and tasty from Dallas to Dubai. However cabin crew didn't respond for long on 2 occasions I called through my seat button. Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg. I got value for money since I got a very low fare.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;Returned from Dubai to Newcastle on the 23rd November 2014. Our inflight entertainment system did not work. The staff tried resetting it but this did not cure the problem. Eventually I was offered another seat which I declined as we were travelling as a couple I did not wish to move without my husband. When the hot meal was served we choose the chicken which was cold. Mentioned this to the staff who offered another meal but declined this. Beware they have got too big to care.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;DUB-DXB-DEL. The flight from Dublin was delayed which meant I was a bit worried about my connecting flight from Dubai as I only had about 2 hours transit but transit was pretty smooth. I had a positive experience with the security staff at Dubai airport - the guy who checked me was polite and smiled. Compared to Doha airport Dubai seemed a lot better organized. This was my first time transiting through Dubai and I was impressed. The food on both flights was decent without being outstanding. For vegetarians Air India and Jet Airways definitely offer a superior product. The staff on the Delhi flight neglected to distribute immigration forms which meant that the foreigners on the flight had to try and find forms at Delhi airport which was hard as they seemed to have run out. A helpful passenger had an extra form and I was saved. Overall I would say the flight was okay without being anything special - about the same as Qatar Airways.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;Great legroom even when the passenger in front reclines back. Cabin crew were friendly. Food was okay. Emirates has the widest inflight entertainment. However the seat width is not really wide as compared to other airlines. In a nutshell all 4 flights I took (Singapore to Dubai Dubai to Glasgow and the return flights) were good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-14;I flew from Dubai to Mumbai on EK502 on 1st Jan 2015. I had a confirmed internet check in with seat numbers allocated.

emirates;2015-01-11;MXP-DXB-BKK-DXB in Business. As usual I found the biz product to be excellent both on A380 and on B773. VIP lounge in Milan is brand new with plenty of seats and amenities with direct separate boarding directly from the lounge. Once on board seats are very comfortable high quality food and drinks smiles and kindness from all the crew. The only weakness is concerning boarding procedures at Bangkok that don't allow priority at all once pre-boarded is all chaotic so you have to literally walk over economy class passengers. EK is one of the most comfortable J class in the market I'll fly with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-11;A380 Dubai - Melbourne. Seated in exit row 52 although some kind of fridge malfunction had soaked the floor so we had to use blankets in order not to get wet - it being a full flight and already in exit row wasn't really going to give it up. Food was slightly disappointing - still perfectly edible but nothing special. IFE was great for TV loads of series but fewer movies. Inflight WIFI is a nice touch although it took me 10 hours to log on. I sent them a complaint email about the wet floor during the flight which I think is pretty good. Overall - the Qantas-Emirates tie up is great for Europe to Australia especially with the overnight timings of the flights and A380's going all directions. Emirates also a solid choice for service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-11;I flew twice with Emirates in December - Bangkok-Dubai-Gatwick returning Heathrow-Dubai-Bangkok then again Bangkok-Dubai-Istanbul and return. Their inflight entertainment options are above average although their headsets were broken 50% of the time. Other than this I am sad to say on both flights I was disappointed with all aspects of their service. Our group were always split in the most odd fashion - even on our business class flight I was separated several rows apart which made no sense. Food options ran out on one flight - chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken - no alternative or other option! We were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option! There are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper. Don't make the mistake I made - don't fly Emirates if you have other options.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-11;I flew from Adelaide to Paris a couple of days ago. Having heard of the really good reputation of Emirates I was looking for to it. I was rapidly disappointed with a very basic service more than average food and their ICE entertainment system really not user friendly with a lack of movie choices. By experience there are far better airlines on offer for a better price too. Travelling back to Australia in a couple of weeks hopefully they will prove me wrong.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-11;DXB-MXP in First. Everything 5 star level boarding with separate F class bus and private suite enables you to join a high level of comfort and privacy. Crew professionalism impressed me I was always called by name from the Purser. Once seat is converted into a bed it is soft and comfortable. EK F class product is far away from all Europeans and can only compete with LH. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
emirates;2015-01-05;LGW-DXB-SIN. Plane 2 hours late leaving LGW due to late inbound arrival. Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing. Landed 03.15 exactly the time onward flight to SIN should have been taking off. That flight had closed so missed connection. Incredibly difficult to get rebooked. Long queues at transfer desk. Staff did not have ability to make re bookings directly but had to call their reservations department somewhere else in airport. Long long waits to get a response (half hour plus for each passenger) and no queuing system on their telephones. No offer to arrange hotels even though some passengers clearly becoming distressed at length of queuing time. To cap it all I later found that my connection was still on the ground when I arrived in DXB and did not leave for another 2 hours even though shown as flight closed i.e.they had allocated my paid for and checked in seat to someone else!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-05;Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. Meals are also average. All-in-all not a good experience over 4 flights with this airline - I would not recommend flying with them - I sure won't if I can avoid it.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2015-01-05;LGW-DXB-SIN. Plane 2 hours late leaving LGW due to late inbound arrival. Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing.

emirates;2014-12-31;EK 384 BKK-HKG in Business. Everything about this airline is superb. Sparkling new A380 warm professional crews nice lounge in BKK. In flight WiFi live TV great IFE bar etc. That said boarding could be improved as it was a bit chaotic.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-31;EK0015 8th Dec. Flew from UK via Dubai to Capetown. Had to travel for work urgently. Last minute booking was easy and good app. Brightervisas secured my SA visa so I was away quickly. Was able to get 15% off loads of things with Skywards membership and the seats and service was great. Downside was the tea but coffee was OK. On return 1 hour delay due to late passenger which was not great but service was top level.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-31;Travelled on DEL-DXB and DXB-Lagos sector. Aircraft on DEL-DXB sector was good. Seat comfort was ok. Food was good and staff courteous. DXB-Lagos sector aircraft was old seats were not that comfortable. However prompt and good service made up for it. Emirates business lounge in New Delhi is very good. Dubai lounge is also good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-31;NCL-DXB-TPE return in economy class 12/12 - 20/12. All 4 legs were Boeing 777-300. Managed to book the 2 seats at the rear of the plane for the entire journey. Legroom not great but managed OK. ICE entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of things to watch. Food provided was nothing to write home about - adequate would be the best term. Flight attendants were OK nothing outstanding. Polite and pleasant. This was my first time with Emirates and had been led to believe it would be an amazing experience. Turned out to be no better or worse than other carriers who fly these routes. A bit underwhelmed actually.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-29;Just flew PER-DXB-FRA. We found the overall experience to be disappointing and don't understand all the hype about Emirates being one of the best. The seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. Qantas has way better seats. The food was average nothing to note at all. The biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly soulless cabin crew on both flights. Barely a smile out of any of them. They looked like they were dead walking just going through the motions of their jobs. One in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. She was gross! Not at all what we were expecting. Maybe our return flights will be better?;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-29;We flew to Istanbul via Dubai on the 01/12/2014 and back on 10/12/2014. There were no problem with the flight itself but we found out afterwards that you get hotel vouchers if you have a stay over longer then 8 hours in Dubai. We had a 10 hours stay over at Dubai to Istanbul and a 12 hours over stay from Istanbul at Dubai. No where we was informed regarding the hotel vouchers-I am sure that I do not have to explain how tired we were. The staff when we bought our tickets should have notified us regarding this. We also only found out about the food vouchers by luck on the internet.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-29;Dubai-Melbourne. First trip on A380 and it was fantastic. Allocated Business class seat on window in row 25 so just a short walk to the fantastic bar area. Seating and amenities were outstanding as was the service from a truly international crew. Entertainment system was the best I have ever used with a wide selection of movies and the flight tracking is brilliant. Food was as good as I have ever had on a flight and there was indeed plenty of it. Overall a wonderful flight and have no hesitation in recommending Emirates Business Class.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-22;My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on DEL-DXB-NCE-CDG-DXB-DEL between 8th and 16th December and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. The DEL-DXB and DXB-DEL flights were the most horrible that I have encountered so far. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. On our DEL-DXB flight I requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request I was rudely told by the staff that she can't give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. It was a clear sign that Emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. Our flight from CDG-DXB was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. However I have high regards for the crew flying on DXB-NCE flight on the morning of 8th December. They were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. They made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. But this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly Emirates again. The attitude of the staff clearly showed that passengers should not expect after sales service once they have paid for their tickets.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-22;KUL-MEL-KUL. The outbound flight to MEL was perfect and in-flight service was top notch. However the inbound flight to KUL was less than ideal. There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this. I was not informed when I checked in over the web or the counter staff at the baggage drop. However given the price out of KL I would fly this airline again.;POSITIVE

emirates;2014-12-22;I flew Business Class Dubai to Casablanca return (777-300) and Dubai to Addis Ababa return (A330-200) last month. All flights were on time cabin crew and service excellent meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats or even the 777-300 but I was very comfortable with the deep recline great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats. These aircraft's are usually only used on their shorter flights and in this situation I have no problems.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-18;DUB-DXB 773 fantastic. New high quality equipment with great attention to detail from very professional staff. Connection to BKK flight in DXB international was a disgrace. Was looking forward to flying the A380 but experience was just not the same 20% of the staff did very little while the others were extremely busy on a very full flight. Conclusion other airlines should take note.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-18;LHR-DBX-SIN A380. Emirates A380 is a brilliant product. I flew economy - and it was arguably the best cabin experience. Spacious great inflight entertainment comfortable seat amazingly lit cabin at night and great food. It was really difficult to fault. The staff were friendly and helpful got some great sleep on the flight too - and there's really not much else to say! Would highly recommend.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-18;EK204-EK304 JFK-DXB-PVG. We are skywards members. Departure time is 12:05AM Delayed for about 4 hours. We would not make our connection flight to Shanghai. The staff in New York only gave us one choice which was fly to Hong Kong from Dubai then transfer the flight back to Shanghai in Hong Kong. We asked them for next flight from Dubai to Shanghai but they said that they can not find the tickets in their system. The A380 from JFK to DXB is ok. Entertainment is the best of all airlines. The seat for A380 have more legroom than the 777. Food is fantastic. Three meals served. You can order beverages or snacks any time on board. I still recommend Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;EK 772 CPT to DXB. Flight was on a Boeing 777-300. Boarding was on time and it was fast. Take off about 30 minutes late but even with almost 30 minutes holding time in DXB plane was still on time or schedule. Crew was nice and food choices was matched. I even got a second hot meal as I was still hungry. Bags were on belt when we arrived there. Only downturn was that the full plane got a remote stand and we had to take the bus to the terminal which took almost another 30 minutes. Would fly EK again since the legroom was great in economy.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;Check in staff at Gatwick were first class and helpful. Boarding was late but no idea why. On the flight the seats were comfortable and meal ok. Staff were not very forthcoming with service! Drinks not offered had to ask for them and was left waiting for over 30 mins holding used cups as no one answered my call bell. On return from Dubai check in staff not very helpful onboard staff - same problem. Slow to answer call bell seats not very comfortable and no drinks offered except with meal. Breakfast omelette was cold and so was the tea. This certainly wasn't up to the standard I was expecting from Emirates given their reputation of being a first class airline.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;EK 57 DXB to DUS Boeing 777-300 with the older ICE AVOD but still enough. Plane was on time both departing and arriving. Food and Beverages service was great. Ice cream was served as well. The crew was fantastic and very friendly they did a great job. Bags on belt took almost 45 minutes but that is a typical DUS Airport problem. Legroom was great again better than other airlines in Europe.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;We flew from LGW to DXB (777-300) stopped in DXB for 3 days and flew onwards from DXB to BNE (A380) as we'd heard good reviews of Emirates and wanted to see a little of UAE. Emirates offered the best price and connections to/from Australia and New Zealand. Really disappointing LGW to DXB service - staff were rude had no personality and seemed rushed. Food was average and entertainment not much better. We left the flight in DXB more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer DXB-BNE sector (14hrs on the A380) but more of the same. Staff were rude unfriendly seemed rushed to complete service more concerned with doing their make-up (we were sat next to the galley) than much else. Really poor. We're flying back CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LGW and to say that we're looking forward to it would be misleading. Compared to other long-haul flights we've flown (Air NZ Virgin Atlantic Singapore BA) Emirates are by far and away the worst - unless it seems you are lucky to be a Gold member when they can't do enough for you.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-10;CPT-DXB-LHR. Appalling start in the Bidvest 'Premier' lounge at CPT stuffed to the gills and poor quality food and drink. FAs friendly enough on 777-300ER but dinner service slow and the 2-3-2 seats lacked privacy for a night-time flight. 4 hr stopover at DXB fine once the gate for A380 flight to LHR had been identified - no thanks to a discourteous DXB employee. A380 impressively quiet as ever and a pair of E/F seats were excellent for a couple. Lunch service again slow and the main courses inedible. Flight deck poor at updating on flight including bad turbulence. Quick disembarkation and speedy baggage reclaim.;NEGATIVE

Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;Boston - Dubai - Mumbai. The long haul 777's economy section is scandalous. It's the equivalent of flying on a cramped domestic airplane for 14 hours. Honestly I have flown many international trips in Economy and never have I been this uncomfortable. In a standard seat it is so narrow that I had to take turns eating with the passenger next to me because neither of us had enough arm room to cut food. There was absolutely no back support in the 'new and improved' economy seats and the 3-4-3 seating is too much for the 777 – so much so that the flight attendants do not even apologize when they hit your seat every time they walk by you in the narrow aisles. On the way from Dubai back to Boston my entertainment touchscreen misregistered every tap meaning that any time I went to pause a movie the system either exited rewound to the beginning or switched to a view of the map. It is clear that Emirates the is flying on a reputation clearly earned before its new-found desire for profit over passenger well being. Like American domestics they will now punish the passenger for the benefit of their bottom line. Unfortunately I will not fly Emirates again if they continue their push for more and more seats in Economy.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;Glasgow to Male via Dubai and return economy class. All flights on time with Emirates' usual professionalism and efficiency in dealing with quick transfers of baggage between flights. The standard economy seats provide enough legroom even for big guys like me (6 foot 6 with long legs). Excellent food and utterly superb in-flight entertainment. Friendly and responsive staff on all flights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;Vienna-Dubai-Manila and return in Business all on B777. Emirates is decent 4-star airline. The night flight out of Vienna was as one would expect - quick dinner service (good meal but nothing special) friendly staff (always addressed me with my name) but seats are far too narrow for business class because Emirates squeezes a middle seat into the centre row. On arrival in Dubai we were bussed to the gate (out of 4 arrivals/take-offs 3 were from bus gates and the bus ride takes quite a while). The business lounge was a disappointment. It is fairly large as it stretches across almost the whole first floor of the terminal but it is rather narrow and dull it overlooks the shopping concourse below (noise) there are showers but they are tiny. Strangely I had to ask for a non- alcoholic beverage at the bar as only juice and water are freely supplied but all hard drinks are self-serve. The onward flight to Manila was on a noticeably older 777 in a two-class configuration. The staff performance on this flight was outstanding. On the return flight one of only two washrooms for C-class broke which lead to queues. The plane was spotless and new but cabin crew performance was below par. Coats and jackets were handed back some 30 to 40 minutes before landing some pax had to keep them over their knees as the adjoining seat was occupied. Drinks and snacks were taken away all of a sudden without warning due to landing (still some 30 minutes away). Generally I would recommend them although I still prefer Qatar or Turkish when travelling into Asia.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;MAN-DXB-CPT in business class. The chauffeur service on time. The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent. Our bags turned up first both at CPT and MAN. Overall a very positive experience.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;Flew Emirates MAN-DXB-KUL and back. A380 from MAN-DXB and B777-300ER from DXB-KUL andmB777-300ER for all legs back to MAN from KUL. The overall flight experience is below average. The seat was OK and a bit weary and some seats had visible stains. The aisle was too narrow the meal cart always hit the the aisle seats every time the cabin crew served the meal. The meal was below average nothing impressive about it. The crew have to learn to be more friendly and definitely need more training to communicate with the passengers. Toilets were fairly dirty after a few hours and crew couldn't be bothered to look after them. The only good thing about the flight experience was the entertainment system. I am totally disappointed as I was expecting Emirates to be one of the best airlines in the world.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;JED-DXB-HYD the trip from JED to Dubai the plane was an A380. The economy seat was quite comfortable and the service was good. The food was outstanding and I liked the ceiling LED lights which give a look of stars. Dubai to Hyderabad was a B777-300ER - the inflight entertainment and the breakfast was good and as usual the service was good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-12-04;MAD-DXB-SYD economy. A380 great seats B777 impossible seats very uncomfortable. Cabin crew poor. Food is good. At gates in Australia the staff were also poor.;POSITIVE

emirates;2014-12-01;BKK-DXB-Moscow. Excellent flight on the way to Moscow entertainment system is excellent with plenty of choices food was very good excellent service. On the way back from Moscow to Bangkok the flight from Dubai - Bangkok was delayed nearly 2 hours for technical problem on their A380 but overall Emirates is still very good. Being a gold member is excellent as the chief purser came to greet you personally before departure.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-25;We have just had four flights with Emirates Gatwick /Dubai/Singapore Beijing/Dubai/Gatwick on all four flights I could not fault the cabin staff they worked very hard frequently coming round with water. The food was typical airline food re-heating an omelette is not a good idea but the warm croissants a nice touch. The seats on the air bus are very comfortable and had plenty of legroom. We had a query before our first flight with regard to seats and customer services were most helpful and resolved the situation. It was a long tiring trip made bearable by Ice the wonderful entertainment system. We were quite happy with our economy flight.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-25;Flew BKK to SYD - seat was really uncomfortable. In the upright position it felt like you were slanting forward and I could feel the metal bars in the seat. It was an 8.5hr flight and was expecting the dinner service to take place quite quickly so I could take advantage of the lie flat bed. Dinner wasn't served until well after 2hrs into the flight and was a disappointment. The staff were friendly and helpful which was great but apart from that I didn't enjoy what should have been a comfortable flight.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-11-25;Again a mixed experience with Emirates EK407 MEL-DUB and EK017 DXB-MAN business class both on A380. Business seat would be tight for a large person cabin crew patchy on night flight from MEL. Food wise advertised items like cheese and coffee had to be specifically requested rather than routinely provided plane from Melbourne was an hour late in to Dubai resulting in a frantic dash over a long distance to Manchester. Plane service and food better on day service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-25;Flew Brisbane to Dubai on 777 and the onto Rome on A380. You really notice the difference between these two planes. The A380 is a lot quieter and seats are more comfortable and spacious. Would recommend sitting in the first section of economy we were rows 49 and 50. Food was of high standard and their entertainment system was fantastic. Easy to use up the time watching a couple of the late latest movies. Would highly recommend to anyone making the trip to Europe from Australia.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-20;31st October. Flew Dusseldorf to Dubai on EK 56 on a Boeing 777-300ER. Check-in and seats we booked via travel agent were honored. Check in for economy with queue was still fast and easy. Boarding was half hour later due to technical. It took them almost 15 hour before take off but no problem so far. Boarding was quick and water was served since there was no air-conditioning on the ground due to the technical. On board we got the menu card and soon drinks and snacks where served before getting lunch. Meal choices was matched and even our no lactose meals was no problem. Flight was smooth and crew came around with water and juice. In between they served ice cream that was nice. ICE avod was nice with plenty of choices. Arriving in Dubai we got a remote stand so we where bussed to terminal that was quick because they use a lot of busses and there was no waiting at all. Would fly them again seats are nice with good legroom compared to LH UA AA or BA and AF/KL.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-20;Flew from Brussels-Dubai-Tokyo and back again a total of 34 hours on Emirates planes. Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is. Families with young kids also get complimentary strollers when they land.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-20;I have just completed a trip LGW to HKG on Emirates via DXB in Business Class. The London to Dubai and Dubai to London were on a 777-300ER the DXB to HKG on an A380. What a difference. The A380 was comfort personified. You are cocooned in your little area with nobody beside or immediately in front of you - I was in seat 23K. You have plenty of space with easy access out to the aisle. The 777 however felt very cramped with somebody sitting next to you. When that passenger has his seat in bed mode you have to clamber over his legs to get out to the aisle. With the A380 you have plenty of storage space with the deep side compartments. On the 777 there is no place to store anything other than the overhead locker. Up until experiencing the A380/777 difference I have never much cared about the airplane I am sitting on - from now on for me it just has to be the A380. Had I taken all legs of this trip on the A380 the marks given would be much higher in the Trip Satisfaction and Seat Comfort.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-20;1st November Dubai to Cape Town on EK 772 on a Boeing 777-300. Transfer in Dubai at night is always full but not as bad as on any other airport. Boarding was on time but had to wait for take off clearance as the pilot informed us. Flight was with snack at the beginning and a nice breakfast before landing with one meal being lactose free. Crew was nice and helpful. We got a nice sleep on the 9 hour flight. ICE Avod system was the new one with even more choices and movies. In CPT luggage was on the belt when we arrived there. Legroom was again very fine.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-20;Brussels-Dubai. Emirates scores very low on staff service. They offered a choice between chicken or lamb on both flights but lamb was never available. They ran out of white wine coke ice but the other aspects check-in entertainment get high scores.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-11-17;Outbound from ZRH-DBX-BKK. Both flights A380. Very comfortable good service. Best inflight entertainment system used many different airlines recently and Emirates is definitely best for that.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-17;LHR - DXB - CPT. Quick boarding of A380 direct from T3 Emirates lounge. Centre pair of seats excellent for a couple. FAs rather robotic with little warmth or humour. Dinner service slow with overcooked main course. A380 impressively quiet on upper deck. Excellent IFE but annoying that one has to use supplied noise cancelling headphones. Flat bed seats reasonably comfortable. Quick disembarkation to huge Emirates lounge at DXB. Bizarre bus journey (30 minutes!) to 770-300 on the other side of the airport for the flight to CPT. FAs again going through the motions and food service just as slow as on A380. Flight noticeably noisier. 2-3-2 business class seating arrangement affords little privacy and seats don't lie fully flat. Arrived in CPT on time with impressively fast disembarkation and baggage collection.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-17;MEL-AKL-MEL in J Class. Wonderful service on both sectors with a really varied and friendly crew on each sector. Staff were oblivious to the call button on the return leg the bight little light above my seat didn't attract anyone's attention which I found quite grating considering how professional these crew were appearing to be. The seats were extremely comfortable and although perhaps not quite as comfortable as some airlines lie flat fold over beds for sectors like this they were great. The scrambled eggs on the breakfast flight out of MEL were very disappointing and quite solid but a small grizzle. The dinner on the AKL-MEL leg was exceptional the best steak I've had in the sky! The bar at the back is a great feature it was packed coming back into MEL. For this reason I'd avoid sitting in the rear cabin the noise would be too much on a long night flight. Only real (yet again very minor in the scheme of things) complaint when our jackets were handed back as we started to descend there was nowhere to hang them around the seat. They had to lie crumpled on our lap or draped along the bins at the side. A hook in the seat back would be so handy. Would recommend anytime and aside from the couple of small complaints a perfect way to fly. Well done EK. SQ have lost themselves a regular traveller.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-17;Traveled Business Class to LHR - EK005 on the 5th November returning from MAN - EK022 on the 11th November 2014. The 380 flight to London had a delayed departure but this did not deter me from enjoying the flight in total. The return flight from Manchester on a 777-ER was serviced by a crew that was second to none. On both legs the quality of food served was excellent in fact I go as far to say it gets better and better every time I fly with Emirates. I am a gold Card member preferring to travel with Emirates on all my flights. Enjoying the journey with Emirates really starts in the Business lounges. The new Dubai dedicated 380 Lounge is wonderful the Manchester lounge is obviously smaller but very pleasing typical of the other Emirate lounges around the Globe.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-12;Flew the A380 from Kuwait - Bangkok round-trip. Best in-flight entertainment I have seen. Comfortable seats nice lounge excellent staff and would recommend flying Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-12;CPT-DXB-SIN. First leg old A343 that had really old IFE and seats. Food was good and the staff welcoming. For DXB-SIN I was on a 773 that had the current cabin and I was impressed all the way. Seats were really comfortable food was good staff were great and IFE was good. The only problems were the boarding process and delay. It was weird that passengers had to sit in separate areas of the holding room for boarding also there was an hour delay. If I had the chance I will try to fly EK again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-11;LGW to HKG return. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. The staff were actually interested in the passengers and polite and hard working. There was no amenity kit but we did get hot towels. The food was tasty and plenty of it. Sensibly they only served a light snack on the very early departure from Dubai. We were late leaving London but made up the time and caught our connection. Plenty of films to watch. The seats were comfortable especially on the A380.It made a nice change to go from Gatwick.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-06;Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-06;Shanghai Pudong-Dubai-Shanghai Pudong recently on A380 positive sides - amazing entertainment comfortable seat both flights on time. Downside - poor food and beverage quality no water/any food between light meal and breakfast - it's a 10hr flight! EK is far below SQ/QR or even KL in terms of service!;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-11-03;The seats are uncomfortable the staff service is poor they take along time to come when we need them. They use a big portion of time chatting with each other rather than actually serving the passengers. Slow serving meals and taking the empty trays. There should be more water and juice runs I'm unsatisfied and definitely won't recommend them to anyone I know.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-11-03;LGW-DXB-CMB-DXB-LGW. All flights economy class on B777-300ER. My first time flying with Emirates and a good experience overall. All flights on time. Comfortable seats but on the 777 you would not want to be sat next to a large person as the seats are 10-abreast in economy rather than the usual 9. Excellent touch screen entertainment using ICE system. Very good food served. Sadly Dubai International is not big enough for the large numbers of passengers and was heaving and cramped. Overall a good experience but Singapore Airlines is still my favourite.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-11-03;B777 from MAN to DXB in Economy. Ok but nothing special. Hard to get comfortable in seat and food average. Service passable but no more. Onward flight to Sydney on A380 and got a surprise but very welcome upgrade to Business Class at Boarding gate. Huge difference for a 13 hour leg. Able to sleep in lie flat seat. IFE very good on big screen and drinks top class. Service good but food only average and nothing special for Business Class.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-31;AMS-DXB-PER with first 6h30m leg in Business on A380 and second 10h15m in First on 777-300ER. Business class on the A380 offers an excellent experience with the best IFE there is a comfortable and cosy seat that sits well in all positions (including fully-flat bed). The drinks on offer are also excellent best cappuccino there is in the clouds but the food is very average with the menu not changing often and the mains being the true letdown. Transfer at DXB T3 very efficient as always. First on the 777-300ER is truly great with private suites an excellent seat that converts in a very comfortable bed (am 192cm tall) fine a la carte dining huge tv screen. As good as it gets!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-31;Very good airline but unfortunately the boarding/disembarking procedures at Dubai airport are a nightmare. Except for flights operated with A380 which are parked at gates for many flights operated with B777 and A330 the airplanes are parked at remote stands which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building. I do not recommend flying with Emirates unless on the A380.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-31;"Had problems with the airline even before my trip as they changed my flights. If I hadn't called them to check about something I would not have known! I flew Emirates London-Jakarta via Dubai. Flight from Heathrow was delayed by about an hour. Dubai-London flight I had the ""wake me up"" sticker at the meal time the crew ignored the sticker. Food was average. and inflight entertainment was excellent. Overall I was disappointed with the service I received as I had high expectations of Emirates. It's not as good as it used to be a few years ago.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-31;Recently flew GLA - DXB - JKT and took advantage of the special business class upgrade offer via e-mail. The new emirates lounge at Glasgow is very good even when comparing it to the Dubai business lounge. Local food was on offer and there was a wide range to choose from. Business seats on the new style 777 are very comfy and plenty of options on the ICE system. I have been offered the business upgrade 3 times and have always taking it but the major annoyance is it will not allow me to upgrade online and always results in me having to phone and explain the whole situation which takes forever.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-31;Copenhagen to Manila via Dubai. The flight from Copenhagen was 1 hour delayed because of late arrival from Dubai. Boarding in Copenhagen was fast. The service from Copenhagen to Dubai on the flight was good and the ICE system working well. The boarding in Dubaifor the flight to Manila was good. The plane was one of the older models of the 777 so for the ICE system you needed to use the remote. The return flight from Manila to Dubai was good the check in was fast and nice that they are now using terminal 3. Boarding was good and first time I saw boarding using zones not used in the other airports. The plane was an old B777 and the IFE system was not working well - it was stopping in middle of movies. Flight from Dubai to Copenhagen was good was one the younger 777 plane so ICE was working with out any problems.;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-10-28;Compared to anything we have in the U.S. and other international airlines I've flown this organization is top- notch. Or at least they try to be. Flew the A380 JFK to Dubai and A340 Dubai to Seychelles and back again. Were upgraded to Business Class on the second leg which was absolutely amazing. The A340 seats not as comfortable as the A380 but once you're on the A380 it's hard to find anything to complain about. Service great pillows headphones blankets great entertainment. My husband enjoyed the music options and we both enjoyed the in-flight information system. Bathrooms plentiful and clean seats comfortable boarding and disembarking painless and we got our free meal vouchers in the Dubai airport and got our free meal! How many airlines do that? I hate to fly but this was definitely a treat. It was a bit pricey to say the least but you get what you pay for. I think Emirates are doing a great job. Would gladly fly them again. Customer service did their best in every area.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-28;"We recently travelled on Emirates but were disappointed that the flight home from Dubai/Adelaide was overbooked and on arrival at the check counter at 11.30pm for a 2.00am departure that we would not be able to board the flight. Our luggage was tagged and we were asked to wait until the plane was boarding to see if our seats would be available (along with 4 other passengers). With 40 mins to go we were told that we could now board and to hurry through customs immigrations and no stopping to shop so that we would make the flight. We were given EUD 100 each to spend on duty free on the flight but the crew told us that ""they were far too busy to offer any duty free items"" and this was a 12 hour flight. We still have the vouchers but what good are they to us?";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-28;Leaving on QF 1 on 12 Oct and from Dubai back to Sydney via London on Emirates planes. All sectors on A380. The aircraft is the common factor between Qantas and Emirates. But the experience is so different. The Qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. Emirates FA's are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. On EK 2 from LHR to Dubai on Saturday 18 October it was particularly bad. A couple of FA's would not have been out of place on easyJet. One fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. On four sectors flown in the last week on Qantas and Emirates planes it can be said that Qantas came out way on top. This is not some pro Australian rant. Have been using Qantas and Emirates combination for a while now and the same result. What can Emirates do? Get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. At the moment they all look and act like kids serving in McDonald's. I will continue to fly Emirates as their scheduling from Australia is so good and much of my work is in the Gulf and Europe.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-28;First and probably last time with Emirates. At least not on this connection to Beijing. EK306 arrives into Beijing at 15:10h. It is a 500 Passenger flight arriving simultaneously with other flights from Singapore Hong-Kong Dubai Doha Fukuoka and Vancouver. Immigration took nearly 2 hours due to the masses of people arriving. Chauffeur Service did not wait. Disgraceful Emirates Service at the Airport and no apologies whatsoever. The immigration staff did their very best to speed up the process and all 24 Counters were open. Just way way to many people arriving at the same time. 15.10.2014 EK60 HAM-DXB on B777 and continuing on EK306 DXB-PEK A380. Chauffeur service to HAM excellent new Mercedes S-Class all the comfort you need before a 16h Trip to Beijing. Lounge at HAM okay - lots of good quality food and drink quiet and very large thus not crowded even though flight was fully booked in Business Class. Aircraft was very new (April 2014) but 5 Row Business Class is just unacceptable. No real storage. Agree with most users that Seat is much too narrow and doesn't go fully flat (opposed to A380) I am a smaller person and the seat would not really fit in any position. Food was okay. Good but grumpy stewardess serving my seat. Overall a typical flight on a fully packed plane. DXB is a very nice airport (even at night) but very crowded. Business Lounge in T3A is good but very slow and spotty WiFi. Boarding directly to A380 Upper Deck is a nice touch but also clearly a necessity because of the crowds and cramped waiting areas for Y guests on the main floor. Flight DXB-PEK was comfortable had a good sleep - service was uneventful. Business Class was about 70% Full. On Board Entertainment again the best I have seen yet. The rest about Emirates has been explained on a platitude of occasions here.;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-10-22;"CMB-DXB: EK655: A330-200 Oct 12: Business Class. Plane immaculate for its age (1999-2000). However horribly let down by the most uncomfortable Business Class seats I've ever experienced over the past 17 years. Seven across in Business Class instead of six in an A330 is a rip-off. These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats. Not suitable for the 4.5 hour flight. Service was very good and the food and beverages were good too. There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds. The whole experience was let down by these awful seats the main reason one buys Business Class in the first place to get more personal space not something worse-than Economy Plus. Check-in and the dedicated Emirates Lounge at the BIA in CMB were excellent. On time performance and good baggage transfer to my connecting BA flight. EK is generally good but not their A330-200 seats.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-22;I usually fly to Europe in economy class with Singapore Airlines via Singapore or Thai Airways via Bangkok but was persuaded to try Emirates. I found the 14.5 hours from Sydney to Dubai to be unbearable. The service from flight staff was both difficult to access and disinterested. Staff on the second leg to Amsterdam were much more personable. The experience was so bad that I have paid almost $3800 to upgrade to Business Class for the return journey. It had better be worth it!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-22;Flown MNL-DXB-MNL Sept 20 on EK 337. I was amazed by the in-flight service. Five drink runs on an 8 hour flight food is plenty and palatable. All the crew are hard-working attentive and friendly. And of course it's infamous inflight entertainment system ICE not to be failed to be mentioned. Looking forward for my next flight with them.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-22;LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies. Have a good flight if you are considering this airline.;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-10-22;Arrived at Dubai DBX at 18.15 for 21.45 on 10/10/14 flight to Perth to be told flight was over booked we had been travelling through Europe for eight weeks and had a stop over in Dubai. I was very surprised to hear we had no seats having booked the flight nearly 12 months in advance. We only managed to secure seats after we explained our daughter was flying overseas on the 11/10/14 and we would not see her for 3 months. We have travelled with Emirates several times because of the quick connecting flights to Europe but intend to look at other airlines operating from that area in future. We were very disappointed they way we were treated by Emirates on the last leg of our journey home it was the only blemish of our holiday.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-22;EK412 SYD-AKL 08.45 7 October 2014. A380-800. Very comfortable and extremely on time. The inflight entertainment was good so you don't care about anything else. Time went really fast because you are comfortable.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-22;EK0010 LGW-DXB. My experience with my recent Trip to Dubai to celebrate my 50th birthday travelling with Emirates was great and I have since recommended the airline to all my friends and family. The service and staff were excellent from start to finish.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-20;DMM-DXB-LAX return trip on Sept 18 and Oct 6 2014. I am a frequent traveller on this route at least 3 times a year and always with Emirates. After so many years of loyalty I am now tempted to try other airlines for the following reasons: Menu does not change on this route and it gets so unexciting and predictable after so many flights. While quantity of food is generous the taste is so below average. I have never seen sea-food being offered on this menu it is always the predictable steak Indian dish and Arabic dish. On board service consistency is very patchy sometimes I am lucky to be served by kind and helpful flight attendant in 50% of the flights I had not. Simple things such as smile when attending the customer never miss any customer when laying down mattress on long haul flight will be appreciated. While other aspects such as on-time arrival IFE lounge access complimentary limousine pick up at LAX are fine the on-board menu needs to be improved to retain customer loyalty. Considering that Emirates are charging premium and much more expensive that competitors I see no reason why it cannot improve on the menu and consistency of on-board service. Loyal customers such as myself are now shopping around for better experience and value than what Emirates is offering at the moment on the route. With less generous miles and redeeming a ticket now will cost close to 1000 dollars in additional fees and charges there has been something Emirates truly learned from its partner Qantas in how to upset its loyal customers by slapping them with 4 digit charges. Come on Emirates you used to wow me but not anymore.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-20;EK147 Y 22 Sep Dubai to Amsterdam. First time with Emirates on their A380 crew friendly on boarding. Seating was comfortable with excellent inflight entertainment system. Was served a light breakfast after departure which was tasty. We were situated reasonably close to the galley on this flight and I can't but help feel this particular crew may have been in training under the eyes of a supervisor with exacting standards. The inflight service food and beverage service was great not too much but not too little. Inflight announcements were clear. Lunch menu had a good choice and again was very tasty as was the free flowing wine service which I personally enjoyed.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-20;6 Aug Gatwick-Dubai EK0010. 11 Aug Dubai - Singapore EK 0352. Sep 8 Singapore-Heathrow EK0005. London-Dubai service was appalling. Dinner was served after midnight although the flight took off at 8.15pm by then I was desperate for water which the crew kept saying they would serve with dinner. They ran out of choices on their menu and could only serve chicken. We were not served any breakfast nor a beverage before landing. However the flight from Dubai-Singapore was better than the one from Heathrow to Singapore. I won't take this flight unless it is the only airline that'll take me to the destination.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-20;After not having flown on Emirates in almost 7 years I recently flew EK round trip NYC/JFK to Milan/MXP. Departed on Thu 2nd Oct and returned Wed 8th Oct. Friendly service on both flights. Smiling and smartly turned out flight attendants on both flights always seen in the cabins. On the outbound flight - flying time of 7 hours 5 minutes 2 hot meals served. In between the meals 2 beverage services were provided. I like many other passengers skipped the hot breakfast in favor of more sleep time. On my return flight with flying time of 8 hours and 40 minutes a copious hot lunch was followed by an offering of fresh fruits and snack bars from wicker baskets. This was followed by a hot pizza snack and then about an hour prior to landing the same wicker baskets with fruits snack bars and pre-wrapped vegetarian sandwiches were offered. All of this in economy class! What more do passengers want?;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-13;I flew NCL-DEL-NCL. The flight was good. I ordered a special meal and this was provided. The flight attendants were very receptive and helpful. The entertainment system was one of the best I've used. It had a very wide variety to offer. The seats were neat clean and comfortable. Will definitely fly again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-13;ICN-DXB and DXB-LIS between October 5/6 on economy. Check-in was smooth and simple at ICN. Departed about 10 minutes late but arrived about 20 minutes early. Staff ranged from nice to snippy. Food was good with multiple drinks services in between meals. Noodles were available between meals but didn't see anyone having them. Entertainment system on A380 was state-of-the-art and worked perfectly with countless movies TV shows and albums to pick from. Wi-fi was free on that flight thanks to Eid and worked flawlessly on phone and tablet. Seats comfortable and roomy. Arrival and transfer in DXB was normal. DXB-LIS had an older B777 which is not as good but my window seat was on the back which has a 2-4-2 configuration. Recommend getting a seat on that section as you have more aisle space. Food was better than on the other flight with multiple drinks services in between meals again. Entertainment system is the same but the touch screen wasn't as responsive and software was slightly slower due to age of plane. Staff was nicer and didn't mind engaging in chit-chat with passengers. Departed 15 minutes late but arrived 30 minutes early. Overall very nice flights and airline.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;Long time Emirates business class passenger - Australia to UK and or Europe. Flights and services are deteriorating and we will look to another airline after recent trips in September. Flight from Melbourne to Dubai was given a gate at Cargo terminal in Dubai resulting in long delays in off loading passengers and luggage and our luggage (plus the other passenger's) then missed our next flight to Zurich. Staff not good on flight. Dubai to Zurich staff were better. Returning found no Emirates business lounge at Amsterdam - desk staff embarrassed and unhelpful. Gate slow to open and not enough seating - area of terminal where Emirates is located has almost no services. Amsterdam to Dubai staff were helpful and so were Dubai to Melbourne staff. Luggage came out late.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;Jakarta (JKT) to Dubai DBX - the seats are very narrow and uncomfortable for a Business class. The food was outstanding but the airplane was dirty. When you fly for business you require a good rest on the aircraft and you expect a comfortable seat.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;Just flew return BNE to DXB on A380 and then onto VCE on a B777. I agree with what many on here have said. If your flight is on an A380 then it will be excellent plenty of space plenty of food and drinks toilets clean and spacious. If you are on on B777 not so good - cramped seat configuration staff overworked felt not much different to a budget carrier. If it were a long haul flight I would consider another airline.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;"Flew on the EK 38 on September from Birmingham to Dubai. First time flight on Emirates very disappointed! Expected great things long wait for bar service told not long after two hours food arrived no drinks. Asked cabin crew ""it's a short flight"" we are not serving drinks until later. Really not what we were expecting. Biggest problem was the very poor attitude of crew. Complaints department said drink fountains are provided.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;My flight was a true class act. Flew First Class DFW-DXB and it was better than expected. The crew were friendly and personable aiming to please throughout the flight. From the Dom Perignon champagne to onboard shower onboard lounge at the back of business class to the limo ride to my hotel in Dubai it was a flight to remember. This was my first time flying Emirates and after reading some of the mixed reviews here I have to say my experience surpassed all my expectations. For the benefit of readers I have flown a lot being a Lufthansa Hon (highest tier status) for the past 6 years. My opinion is the European carriers have a lot of catching up to do if they are to retain their share of premium passengers especially from the USA where Emirates is rapidly expanding.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;We were really looking forward to our A380 Melbourne to Auckland and return trip on a top airline. Although the plane was clean and comfortable. There were problems with staff and service. Our flight over was a 7am departure yet after the initial delivery of hot towels staff were absent unless called for nearly 2 hours not even to offer of water! Breakfast when it finally arrived was tasty although beverages came much later than the food. The same thing happened on the flight back a 6.30 pm departure with no food or drink until 8.15. On a nearly 4 hour flight drinks should be much more freely available. The entertainment system was more than fine but why interrupt everyone's viewing to tell us to watch it?;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;HKG-DXB-VIE and the same in return using A340 B777 and A380 aircraft. Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-12;Bangkok to Dubai and then on to BHX. A very pleasant trip on both legs of the Journey. The only gripe I have was the seven hour wait in Dubai but that was my fault for booking that flight. The flight crew were great the food was great and the ICE entertainment was world class. The return trip BHX to Dubai and Bangkok was great. No complaints from me except one (when food was served the crew did not ask the people to put their seat back to the upright position). Other than that I can say that Emirates are a very good Airline to fly with and I would have no hesitation in flying with them again in the future.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-08;2 Oct Glasgow-Dubai 777-300ER. Check in smooth and easy at Glasgow. Flight was nearly an hour late taking off which made our connection tight in Dubai. Can't fault the staff or service on board although the food wasn't great. Sat at the back of the plane in one of the few rows of two seats. Dubai-Hong Kong A380 - wider seats and much smoother ride. Again food quite bland but all crew were friendly and cheerful. Switched seats at check in to an empty row towards the back and luckily had all three seats to ourselves so very comfortable journey.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-08;I neither would fly Emirates again nor recommend them. They position themselves as a high end service but are actually low cost/low service. We just flew Rome to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok. The Dubai to Sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating (3-4-3). The 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but EK has added an extra seat in the middle. The cabin is like a sardine can. The service was amateur. The entertainment system average. A horrid flight and experience. EK positions itself against Singapore Cathay Qantas and the like. However it really is a third rate airline. Never again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-08;"Emirates service has down downhill over the last few years. Recently flew Melbourne to Dubai and return. A380 both ways. Check in staff very disinterested. Plane was extremely hot. I rang for some water - no one came. The second time I went to the galley and asked for a drink. Staff just gave me a drink and walked off. Passengers recline their seats during meal times which makes life very difficult. Food was appalling on flight over and back - stale bread rolls even warmed up croissants tasted stale. Dubai check in staff even worse than Melbourne for return flight. The woman went to put wrong labels on my luggage. When I pointed this out she said ""Well there are two flights to Melbourne"" - I would have thought that was her job to check not mine. Very hard to get a drink on flight going home. Snacks were handed out in the night but our row missed out. A man sitting behind me asked for some nuts and was told ""There are no nuts for economy passengers"". Sought of sums up the whole attitude.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-10-05;I have flown Emirates pretty much all my life. Emirates considers itself one of the best airlines - I think this is true only sometimes. For the most part I see the service (on certain routes) getting worse with time. By service I mean that of the cabin crew. They do not seem to like their jobs at all and don't like dealing with passengers. I agree it's not nice dealing with certain passengers who don't co-operate but why treat everyone the same way? And why must we hear what the cabin crew have to say about the unruly passengers? With some other routes I still do see very friendly cabin crew from time to time but it's rare now. Entertainment is pretty good on some flights but some routes it's terrible almost non-existent. I do like the food though. The flights would be so much better if the cabin crew seem less - angry impatient and grumpy. You almost feel like a criminal when you request something!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-01;This is the first time that I have flown with Emirates and if I can avoid it I will never fly with them again. The service was terrible - the meal was served and half an hour later they came to ask if we wanted beverages with our dinner. Bit late as most people had already finished. The leg room was not adequate for an average person and the staff were very indifferent to the passengers. In Dubai it was more important that the girls behind the desk send text messages than attend to customers. We actually had to ask them to help us even though there were two people behind the desk and no one except us waiting. So much for customer service. I can't think of anything positive about the experience. By comparison Qantas for the second leg to Sydney was a dream with attentive staff beverages offered at the same time as meals. Snacks bought around every hour as well as water and other beverages offered every hour. The toilets were clean and tidy and the staff were super friendly. Could not fault their service.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-01;Emirates Flight 406 from Dubai to Melbourne 22 SEP. The limousine failed to pick us up at our hotel which had been arranged the previous day. There were no ground staff to show us the way to the lounge/gate. On board I found the staff less than friendly. I expect to receive prompt attention when I request water to be replaced and food to be delivered during the breakfast service. My past experience has been satisfactory the steward aboard our Nice to Dubai flight on 20 SEP made sure we knew the aircraft features and helped with our carry-on bag at the bottom of the stairs on our arrival in Dubai. The state of the Business washroom on 22 SEP was unsatisfactory. I followed a staff member who had just used the washroom and found the litter container full and overflowing toilet paper on the floor and the toilet bowl very dirty. I have been a frequent traveller with Emirates but will consider another airline in the future.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-01;Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok. The audio was broken and static I had to listen to one ear input only! This was a shame as the other experiences I had were great and despite this I would still fly Emirates and recommend them to friends.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-10-01;Flew to Mauritius via Dubai and chose Emirates because of good recommendation. Not impressed. Only good thing to say is that there is plenty of leg room. Crew were uninterested in service and in one case downright rude. Food largely inedible. The breakfast was particularly horrible. My husband had an aisle seat and every time someone went past he was bumped. Would like to know why when we were due to land at 7am we were woken at 4 am. Breakfast arrived at 4.45 and then the lights were put out again. Obviously for the convenience of the crew and not the passengers who appear to be an annoyance.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-10-01;Caught the A380 from Rome to Dubai Sept 17th. Plane was lovely clean plenty of room. Took awhile to board at Rome airport and everyone seemed to want to push on. Staff seemed to lack control of boarding process. We still took off on time though. Food was excellent tasty and lots of it. Drinks were abundant although not cold was offered ice though. Toilets clean. Seats roomy. Seemed a lot of people bringing on a lot of cabin luggage! Staff seemed unconcerned with this. Some children behind me were not being controlled by parents which worried me at first but staff very professionally kept them monitored!;POSITIVE

emirates;2014-09-28;We flew last night from Athens to Dubai and Dubai to Singapore and both flights were horrible. Firstly our flight from Athens to Dubai was on a 777 the seats were that out that the back supports for both myself and my partner were broken and stuck out for the whole flight of 4 hours. Secondly we flew from Dubai to Singapore and for the whole 7.5 hrs flight the entertainment system did not work for me and my partner - it's very poor service and after my last flight tonight from Singapore to Sydney I will no longer fly again with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-24;EK432 Dubai to Brisbane via Singapore (Continuation after EK2 - see separate post). Economy B777-300ER. Disembarking from EK2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. Clear signage to the next gate. Not impressed with T3B terminal. Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE. I had to spend my time in Singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. Very poor form. This along with the incredibly uncomfortable seats on the 777 make it extremely unlikely I will fly with Emirates again if this is the only option available.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-24;"Perth - Dubai - Stockholm then Heathrow - Dubai - Perth. On a Qantas ticket but code shared with Emirates. Emirates Business Class consistently high standard. Personal greetings and introductions nothing too much trouble. Food and beverages excellent. Lounges excellent especially in Perth. Emirates Business seats are slightly narrow for sleeping but overall good. Contrast with Qantas is very stark - Heathrow - Dubai was with QF with other 3 legs with Emirates. QF not quite ""sit down shut up and don't bother us"" - but that's what it felt like. The lesson is - get a QF ticket to get the points and status credits but fly on Emirates codeshare planes to get the service.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-24;"EK402 London Heathrow to Dubai connecting to EK432 to Brisbane (See separate report) Economy Class A380. First ever flight with Emirates. Check in at LHR quick and efficient. Carry on bags were weighed and tagged at check in. Boarding by zones seem to make it quick but it did take a long time. Lots of people wanting to swap seats and a few claiming to be ill to get an upgrade or window seat. Selected bulkhead seat and had couple with baby next to me. Toilets in front and the full size door opened 180 if left and would hit me. People would step on my feet while waiting for the loo. Food was good but there was supposed to be a ""sweet treat"" served with the pre landing drinks. This didn't happen. Given this is about the same length as LHR-JFK BA and AA serve a proper snack. If we were meant to hold onto the ""Light Bites"" from the meal tray then it wasn't made clear. ICE+ was very good but the armrest for the bulk head seats was too low. 18"" seats felt comfortable. Staff very good. Overall a satisfactory flight for the distance flown.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-22;I have flow with Emirates 6 times now and there are some very good good and poor aspects to the overall experience. In particular I refer to our Istanbul to Dubai flight on 7 Aug 2014. There was the normal long delay in check-in due in perceive (after working 30 years in aviation) large quantity of check in baggage that Emirates passengers have - some would see as a plus - combined with minimal experience staff. But the carry on baggage was the big issue both in regard to safety and comfort! Some people were bringing 35kg on board. Bags that just fitted into the lockers and a passenger opposite us had three of them. The onboard staff just helped them put more into the lockers without regard to the effect on others of the 100 passengers I could observe we were the only ones under the 7kg stated limit. When a senior crew from business class started stuffing our soft bags into a smaller space so they could get others large bags away and close the doors I was pointedly told what I could do with my concerns. He did not dispute that others had 35kg of carry on bags! In addition we had 2 obese passengers next to us. The crew provided them with extension seat belts but this doesn't stop them squashing those adjacent. Again the crew were unhelpful. I spent most of the flight walking around the aircraft. Finally the food on this flight was well below the standard I have known on other Emirates flights.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-22;London to Dubai on 6/9 flight EK 012 and returned 12/9 flight EK 0009. I flew business class with Emirates both on 777 and 380 airbus. The seats were narrow in the extreme even on the 380 and I found it very uncomfortable. The staff were 'going through the motions' and the food was tepid. I have flown with many airlines-first time with Emirates. If you compare them to Qantas they have much to learn. Not impressed at all and will avoid in future.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-19;I've flown Emirates over a period of ten years and I can comprehensively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Emirates pitch themselves as being a top-top airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. Their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights I've taken with Emirates progressively gets worse. The cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in Dubai. They are cutting back massively on quality they've stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew don't respond to calls made from your chair. I can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with Emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. I've always looked forward to flying with Emirates and I have quite a few Tier Miles and Skywards miles however I feel I've flown my last flight with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-19;I flew SYD-BKK in Sep 2014. This was my first time flying Emirates though certainly not my first time flying. I've flown quite a few of the greats (ie Cathay Singapore Malaysian Qantas etc) but Emirates completely impressed me. I flew economy and the furnishings and ambience felt and looked better than most economy cabins I've been in. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. Not to mention the flight attendants were immaculately groomed well-presented and spoken and quite attractive (male and female). Their overall demeanour was professional friendly and classy. This is in stark contrast to other airlines (ahem Qantas) whose cabin crew look and act like they'd rather be elsewhere. The food was good and plentiful and the in-flight entertainment was excellent.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-19;Flew Mumbai - Dubai on the Boeing 777-200 ER. Even though the flight arrived late into Mumbai I applaud the Emirates staff at Mumbai to do everything possible to keep the flight on-time and it was with a slight 5-10 min delay in departure. The aircraft had the ICE AVOD system. The first 30 mins of my flight wasn't satisfying as my PTV froze after take off and crew members did not help. It was only a seat change which actually made my experience on Emirates really worthwhile. I was glad to see the patience the Emirates cabin crew have in dealing with passengers. Crew were polite well-mannered and courteous. Food was great. However my seat seemed to be a little bit on the uncomfortable side but I guess for this short sector its pretty good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-19;First time Business Class with EK. VIE-DXB-HKG.DXB-VIE. Disappointing service by cabin crew remote stand in DXB on the way out lounge in DXB very different in the Terminal areas. A380 nice but bar closing early and was partly not staffed while all cabin crew chatting in the back. Service the pure minimum for the travel class (small selection and medium quality) and inflexible. You did not see staff after main service. Woken up for breakfast just to wait half an hour for it and the last hour of the flight there was no service and bar closed. I could have slept longer this happened on both A380 flights. IFE is great good selection. Expectations where high as was the ticket price and EK did not deliver in my view.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong ‘end’. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other ‘end’. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;Just flown Emirates for the first time Manchester-Dubai-Singapore-Melbourne out Mel-KL-Dubai-Manchester return. All in Economy. 14th August to 14th September. I won't use them again. Apart from one leg a more miserable unenthusiastic group of attendants I have yet to see. Food on all of the sections was grim. ICE entertainment on way back awful. On three sections delays and not one explanation even after the First and Business clients complained after us poor souls in economy. I booked thinking I would get Qantas service how disappointed was I. Next time I fly from Manchester I shall use Etihad or Qatar or even go to LHR again. Very disappointed.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;We flew from London to Dubai on 9th September 2014 on the A380 with two children one infant and toddler. It was really great to fly with Emirates. The staff were very friendly good food and it exceeded our expectations. My only regret was not to use the same airline to fly back to London.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;We flew first class from Bangalore to LAX. Emirates has exceptional on the ground service with a punctual chauffeur drive service hassle free check in and security and great lounges. We flew the 777 to Dubai this particular one had Emirates older first class seat which was pretty good it was lie flat and had massage controls a great recline and excellent IFE. Service started with caviar and smoked salmon and we had wonderful steak. Service was good with constant drink refills and a great amenity kit. We landed at Dubai and then headed to the first class transfer desk and then were taken by golf buggies to the first class lounge . The lounge was exceptional with its own duty free area massage rooms private rooms daybeds al a carte fine ding a cigar room a wine cellar and individual buffets at the gates. The best part about this lounge was that we boarded the plane from the lounge. The next sector was on the A380 with private suites and a shower spa. We had champagne on the ground and browsed through their IFE selection. We took off and the wonderful meal service started with excellent food being served and us being the only first class passengers the flight was personalised. Crew were attentive always addressing us by name and telling us about themselves. There is a nice bar with a real bartender and great snacks. The lavatory was neat and the shower spa experience was great with all the shower essentials being provided. We were also given herbal teas and a plate of fruit after are shower which was a nice touch. There were multiple meals and snacks served which were good and the overall experience was great. Emirates first class service is truly unique.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;Rome to Sydney via Dubai. First time with Emirates courtesy of a QF code-share. Both flights on A380 aircraft. I enjoyed the opportunity to sit at the front of the lower deck as economy uses the entire deck. IFE is class- leading and food and drink (including a pre-dinner drink service) was great. Seat pitch was very good as were the crew. I would be very happy to fly Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;EK434 an A380 window seat towards the rear of the cabin. There was an initial delay of 3 hours as the first aircraft became unserviceable. This required all 472 passengers to disembark and relocate to Terminal A. Whilst the cabin crew did well with this unavoidable situation Emirates' ground crew did not handle this well as there was absolutely no guidance or assistance once we were in the terminal. All they needed to do was to advise us to proved to the transfer area re-clear security and take the shuttle to terminal A. They made no such announcement which resulted in some degree of chaos in the terminal building. However this was a relatively minor issue in the overall scheme. Once underway this proved to be the best long haul business class experience I have ever had. The crew were extremely attentive and friendly the catering was outstanding and the privacy afforded by the window seat was second to none. The cocktail bar at the rear of the cabin is a terrific bonus. The fully flat bed with light duvet afforded me the best in flight sleep I have had in many years. One note of caution: if you purchase duty free alcohol in DXB it will be taken from you at the boarding gate and securely stored on the aircraft as UAE law prevents passengers from taking it as carry-on luggage. You will then need to wait for it to be delivered at the point of arrival (in my case at the oversized luggage bet in BNE). This resulted in what would have been a 15 minute customs clearance taking over 40 minutes. The lesson learned: to avoid delays on arrival purchase duty free alcohol at the point of arrival not in DXB. Overall despite the minor inconvenience of the previous aircraft breakdown I cannot fault EK’s high quality service on this flight and highly recommend it for all long haul flights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-17;"I have travelled Emirates a lot but the last 2 experiences were not as anticipated. We flew from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai on the 26th June 2014. Staff on flight to Dubai were good kids fed and good attention. Flight to Johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. You had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which I do not really like doing. Return flight to the UK via Dubai on the 2nd of September was the worst of them all. Staff are different now to when we flew a year ago on the same route. Check in was a hassle in JNB and Dubai. Our 2 year old was not given a child's meal because ""it was not booked"" we had to keep asking for almost everything. Both kids were not given the complimentary toys. The cabin crew seem to have no people skils at all - only one seemed to be on top of his game. Previous staff 2011-2013 were always happy caring and service was impeccable. Standards have changed and I will be trying other airlines after such an experience. Emirates have to do something about their staff especially in terms of customer services and people skills. Travelling with kids is not easy and Emirates has been one of the airlines very good at easing this but this has changed. Cabin crew should not look like they are just doing their jobs but happy to be of assistance.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-09-14;SYD-AKLO-SYD September 2014 Return trip on the A380. Both flights about half full. Food good particularly on return leg and staff were welcoming. They were happy to provide passengers with additional drinks beyond the trolley service with dinner on the return leg. Entertainment fantastic and undoubtedly the best (had flown on Etihad in business the week before and struggled to find things to watch). Flight back to Sydney was 25 minutes early. If they were like this on all their flights then they would deserve a 5 star rating.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-14;Flew MAN-DXB 26 Aug. Ordered Bassinet seat due to 1 under 2. Flew with 2 young children. Given this disappointed at activity pack. Staff rushed and whilst not rude seem stretched tired and not always helpful (huge contrast with our return via Qatar Airways). Considering this is emirates was a distinctly average flight. Satisfactory.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-14;Travelled London to Dubai. Aircraft in excellent condition didn't feel the plane rattle during take off and the landing was perfect. Arrived at destination on time picked up luggage and was out of the terminal 15 min later. Great selection of onboard entertainment that I ended up watching 3 movies throughout flight. Nothing extraordinary with food but as flight was not a long haul it was enough to get by. What I felt was the deal breaker was the rudeness of FAs who didn't give a toss about customer service. A request for water didn't come until a quarter of an hour and only after another reminder met by a glare. When it did the FA (another one) poured too much and spilt some on me but she was in a rush to push her trolley to even say a word of apology. The FAs in my cabin section were hardly smiling and didn't make efforts to put their passengers at ease. Why were they so grumpy and ill mannered?;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-14;We have been flying for Emirates for four years and the service is still amazing. My last flight was DXB-MNL in Business Class. It was a log-haul flight 9.05 hours. This was the first time I've experienced Business Class and it was superb! The seats were lie-flat the crew were (very) friendly and tried to keep you well-fed the IFE System is still excellent and the Lounge was very good. Definitely going to fly with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-09;We flew economy from Paris to Sydney via Dubai. It was my first time flying with Emirates so I was unsure what to expect. Everything was great! Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed. So did that and left the follow morning for Dubai to Sydney. This was a long flight though entertainment system is fantastic. The food for me was nice though my wife did not like any of the hot food. All in all it was a great flight and I will fly with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-09;August 11-12 flight EK127 and EK335. The crew gets sloppier and sloppier! We've flown MNL-DXB-VIE and the crew seemed to react more to a Pax with two Infants rather than one? We didn't get anything for my Infant and the other seat got something? They didn't even ask how old my infant was. All in all I think the service was not as good as always. The crew from DXB-VIE was very slow and seemed so busy that you didn't want to request anything.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-09;Flew London to Bangkok via Dubai. London to Dubai was reasonable no complaints. Other than I had the only seat with the inflight entertainment not working. However the service staff reset this and it began to work. Good choice of films. The entertainment also includes sport TV shows latest movies movie classics and music. The food was good - I had salmon for starter with a yoghurt chicken and sticky toffee pudding. The best flight food I have had. The breakfast wasn't bad either. The seats weren't too good though - slight lack of legroom. Dubai to Bangkok started slightly late but made up the time. Nice choice of newspapers and magazines for in flight use as well. Food on this leg not so good but still reasonable. I had a fish curry which was quite edible. I cant really comment on value for money as I paid for my ticket as a RTW flight so I didn't know the cost of this ticket.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-06;ADL-DXB-LHR. My first time flying with Emirates and enjoyed the journey Boeing 777ER. Check-in was quick and efficient as was the boarding. We were seated in row 19 AB for the flight to DXB. Nice and comfortable seating the in flight entertainment is excellent as was the food and service. We arrived in DXB on time and had a 2 hour layover before our flight onto LHR. The LHR leg was on the A380 in row 43AB. Once again boarding for us was quick and efficient the flight was smooth and the cabin service very good along with the food and beverage. Arrived in LHR on time but would have been earlier as we were held up by ATC. A great experience with Emirates and will definitely fly again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-06;MXP-DXB. This was the first leg of our returning home. Once again check-in was quick and efficient as well as boarding. We were sitting in row 19 AB and had no issues. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient and the food very good. We arrived into DXB on time and then transported to by bus to the arrivals area. Overall and once again a great experience flying with Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-06;DXB-ADL. My wife received an email from Emirates about upgrading what a great choice to do so. We had seats 10 DE. This was our first time in International BC and what an experience from the time we were dropped at DXB terminal 3 business class check-in throughout the flight and disembarking a fantastic way to end our holiday. International BC with Emirates from now on.;POSITIVE

emirates;2014-09-06;Monday 25th August 2014 EK 776. DUR to DXB have been Skywards Gold for many years always had good to excellent service on Emirates. This flight however was one of the worst. Food service has always been prompt after takeoff to allow pax to sleep and breakfast left to the last minute. 2 hours after takeoff and food was served many pax asking for main or asking for table cloth etc. to be removed. Throughout the night there was constant noise from the galley banging of plates crew talking loudly leaving curtain open (I closed it 3 times). Breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing so total sleep time was about 3 hours (normally I get 5 to 6 on this flight). Friend in economy said no breakfast was served and every time he asked for a drink it never came. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-06;I fly Emirates as often as I can and if they had a route from Heathrow to JFK no one would fly either BA or Virgin to NY. This week I flew BA to Dubai for business and Emirates back (only because it was last minute and Emirates was full on the way to Dubai). I flew business class and was upgraded to First just as I was walking on board the plane. It was a complete surprise but they really look after both their silver and the gold card members very well. BA does nothing of the sort. The plane was clean the food superb the staff lovely. It honestly is one of the best experiences in flying on earth and they have really got their product right. It puts their competition to shame. Well done Emirates!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-01;BKK-DXB-KWT Been upgraded in First excellent at every level. Service was spotless food was great and wine was fantastic. Always amazed by this airline. My return to BKK was in Biz really good on A380 had a great sleep.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-01;DXB-AMS in a 777-300er. Booked a economy ticket full fare one day in advance. Received a upgrade to business class when ariving at airport. Great seats staff and diner although Inflight Entertainment felt a little bit worn out in this 777 (A380 had a better system) nice flight and on time!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-09-01;Flew ADL-DXB-BHX return on 777 all the way. Seats felt smaller (not sure if they are) and the service was below average. I had to ask numerous times for a drink on the long let the seat belt signs were on for 8 hours so I could not help myself to water but they did not bring trays of water/juice around regularly either. Everything seemed to be too much trouble. On the return leg from BHX-DXB the flight was not full and many women with children moved away from their sleeping husbands to sit next to other customers who were probably hoping to curl up on the extra seat. They allowed their children to claw the hair of passengers in front and change channels of those behind. They were not asked to return to their seats and one even changed a nappy on the seat and at no time was approached by cabin crew. The food was fairly awful and I was forgotten for over an hour when they ran out of my choice (though I was happy to have anything). It wasn't cheap $2400 AUD return but they are direct from Adelaide.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-09-01;I travel a lot around the world. Flew with Emirates from Stockholm to Dubai and from Dubai to Sydney and later on from Auckland to Melbourne and back to Sweden from Dubai again. All flights were on time the staff was so friendly service on the flight was top notch! Can't complain about anything really. I would travel with Emirates again that's for sure!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-28;DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-28;"19th August GLA-DXB DXB-MRU. Poor experience at silver skywards check in glum emirates staff when asked about upgrading (paid) to business class told ""speak to someone at the lounge"". Upstairs at lounge was told ""there are 4 spare seats but you booked with a company so it's difficult to upgrade you"". After 10 seconds of silence I put my credit card away. Upon boarding I was told ""no seats in business class"" despite what lounge said. Flight great FA's a mix of good and poor food and drink good IFE good. DXB the usual chaos refused entry to emirates lounge as ""it's not family oriented"". A380 boarding chaotic request to pay to upgrade again met with ""it's too complicated to do"" FA's a mix of rude disinterested and superb flight good food and drink good IFE good. Flight on time. Emirates a strange mix clearly not interested in anything below gold / platinum skywards in terms of service.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-08-28;Flew CAI-DXB-CAI Boeing 777-300ER on all sectors. Outbound was first day of Eid loads in Y could not have been more than 60 people. Very pleasant flight cabin crew friendly and efficient. Hot towels and a menu with 2 options lamb kofta or chicken. Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests. The service and EK Y product is what really makes a difference and of course the added advantage of flying non-stop as opposed to connecting.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-28;"I recently flew from Singapore to Melbourne on a Boeing 777. On the plus side the fare was extremely cheap - $79 for a round trip ticket. The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so. The service was also not the friendliest - though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-28;"Flew EK384 BKK-HKG today my first Emirates flight in 2 years. Every time I fly this airline I swear I never will again - things have not improved. The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy. I've flown economy and business and in all instance staff attitude has been absolutely appalling. For completeness the flight was also an hour late although compared to the staff this was only a minor annoyance.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-26;Traveled SIN-DXB-BCN and MXP-DXB-SIN on Economy. On the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in Dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in DXB which is still not up to the standard of Changi in Singapore or HKIA and the wifi that I could never get going (and I wasn't the only one). On the flight DXB-BCN on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so I just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. Managed to get to my gate (after a long walk) and boarded the flight. Nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on Singapore Airlines or Qatar. FA's doing their job and that's it nothing like Thai Singapore or Cathay they are young but not very service oriented. And last but not least they lost my bag. I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery. Business Class doesn't look anything special narrow seats on the 777 and if you're on the middle section you will be seated 3 abreast.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-26;"Bangkok-Hong Kong-Bangkok. I take this round trip fairly regularly. I love the A380 especially the on-board bar where I spend most of my time! I think the Emirates lounges on the ground are the best. However the flight on 20th August Hong Kong to Bangkok just did not gel. The business cabin was only a third full and there seemed to be more flight attendants than passengers. A decent time after seat belt sign was switched off we strolled back to the bar and had a pleasant drink and snack. We were then told (and not too nicely!) that if we wanted to eat we would have too return to our seats. Fair enough but I wish I had forgone the dinner presented and stayed with the snacks. My prawns with noodles was atrocious. The noodles were a dry tangled coagulated mass and impossible too eat. My companion's chicken was similarly inedible. Are these business class dinners cooked and prepared in Dubai 24 hours before? They certainly seemed to be. After dinner back to the bar where with one hour to go before landing we were told by the attendant that the bar would be closing in 10 minutes and it did. And no further service even to the seat with 20 minutes to go before even the captain announced the descent. Weather perfect no turbulence. I just had the feeling the entire cabin staff were in a ""couldn't give a damn"" frame of mind. This was disgraceful. On no other Emirates flight has this happened. I was very disappointed.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-20;Flew round trip from Houston to Dubai in August 2014 seated in economy class party of four. Seats are fine but cushions are on the firm side. Inflight entertainment was very good several choices of things to watch across several categories. Children enjoyed their flight having found several movies to watch received their food first with colorful cutlery had their pictures taken with flight attendant hat etc. The adults suffered from what seemed to be lacklustre customer service. Attendants were professional but seemed somewhat inexperienced. never truly felt that they valued me as a customer. All meal services experienced lack of stated item availability. Decent flight but have experienced better customer service on Qatar Sri Lankan and Singapore airlines. I may fly with them again for direct flight to UAE but if I am continuing on I will choose other airline(s).;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-20;This was my first flight on both Emirates and the A380. Neither lived up to the hype. Emirates is trying to build a reputation as a premium carrier with budget prices but ultimately they failed in some crucial areas. The food was sub-par especially on the HKG-DXB leg where it was downright inedible. Flight attendants were reasonably efficient but neither particularly friendly nor very welcoming. The layover in Dubai was simply too long at 4 hours but the A380 requires extra time for transfer which brings me to the second major issue with Emirates. The A380 is a cattle carrier I will never fly again. Emirates loves those planes because they can fill them up and maximize profits with sheer volume of passengers. There are inherent flaws like the lavatories behind the cockpit that have staircases leading to them. This causes unnecessary risks and inconvenience to passengers. Another problem of course is that moving that many passengers requires extra time and increases the risk of delays and other mishaps. After an 18 hour journey we had to wait for an infuriating hour at the baggage carousel in MUC. This experience was repeated by friends who traveled on the same route a few days later. Even efficient HKG couldn't move the baggage in an acceptable time frame. For me that was not only the first flight on Emirates and the A380. it was also the last.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;Excellent trip all round. Flight EK 373 from Bangkok (BKK) to Dubai (DXB) then only 1.05 hour wait to transfer to EK039 (Airbus 380) to Birmingham (BHX). Flight attendants were superb. EK373 when serving food the attendant asked if I'd like a drink with my (pretty nice) meal so I asked for a gin and tonic - 'Would you prefer a double sir?' was the reply! Then as she was leaving she said 'Oh I may as well give you another one while I'm here save me coming back'! Great stuff! On her return to collect the tray she asked if I'd like a glass of wine 'to help your food go down'. I agreed so she then said 'Oh we only have half bottles will that do? In fact while I'm here I'll give you two so you don't go thirsty'. EK 039 to Birmingham (Boeing 777) was an excellent flight with great service yet again. On my return EK038 from BHX (777) the flight attendants were somewhat less attentive but perfectly adequate. However (and this probably was why the flight was much cheaper than normal) there was an 8.05 hour stopover at Dubai where signage and facilities were not as good as expected. However the practising of a youth orchestra and a girls choir in departures was delightful and a nice surprise which whiled away some empty hours. EK 370 from DXB to BKK was fine again the attendants not as attentive as on the outward leg and there seemed to be about 20 of them! However service was quite good although some attendants seemed to be on autopilot at times. All in all Emirates lives up to its reputation and I was more than happy with the experience. The 8 hour stopover in Dubai was a bore but that's what happens when you get a flight £400 cheaper than normal I suppose.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;RUH-DXB-MRU arrived a few hours ago. EK818 I left Riyadh last night and my flight arrived to Dubai on time. The seats were good and comfortable seats though the width is sort of small. It was a 777-300 2-3-2 configuration. Food was great! The Lounge at Dubai T3 was rather disappointing. Very busy there was some noise from the passengers outside of the lounge the internet was horrible it didn't even work because the network was overcrowded! EK701 DXB-MRU on an A380 and I had my expectations up because I've heard a lot of good things about Emirates Business class seats on the A380. The cabin wasn't full which was good (for me at least) the seat width was pretty tight because of the drink bar in each seat. Flight crew were really nice. The onboard lounge was really nice the food was good and I met a few passengers on the flight with me which was a good experience. Turbulence hit which was really strong and stayed for some time so I was sort of stuck in the lounge for some time but I was busy chatting with the crew and passengers. Flight arrived on time. This is my 1st time flying Emirates and I had higher expectations but it was OK. I would fly again if I had to and didn't have any other alternative.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;AMS-DXB-SYD. Both legs on A380 booked business class upgraded to first on DXB-SYD. Emirates offer top-notch one- stop connections to Australia and their partnership with Qantas provides for great fares when also adding domestic flights to one's trip. I flew SYD-BNE and BNE-PER on the same ticket and flew PER-DXB-AMS inbound. Emirates business class on the A380 in my opinion beats SQ and CX. Great seat excellent IFE bar is very pleasant on long flights good connections at DXB. Was also upgraded to first for PER-DXB-AMS on 77W which is also a great plane to fly. Business is better on the A380 but first offers the same suites on both airframes. Emirates is very reliable and offers great value for money. Food is maybe not 5* but I'd rather have a good schedule excellent seat and great IFE.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;ADL to DXB. Slow boarding and no separate lines for First and Business. ICE System had to be re-booted halfway through the flight. Business class about 70% full and still the steak dish was unavailable. Only had the choice of the other two spicy dishes. Disappointing regarding meal availability for business out of ADL. Meal table in the Business Class seat not working correctly. Slow drink service on take off Business Cabin Crew seemed new and unsure. Business class to Geneva a few weeks prior was of a much higher standard.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;MEL-CPH B777-200ER return and had a great experience. In the air warmly greeted and escorted to our seats great food and attentive service. Seats were comfortable screens were large and staff were looking for opportunities to serve. First Class lounges in Dubai are terrific. CPH 1st lounge not so. Where Dubai is spotless and easy to find in both terminals we used the CPH lounge floor was poorly signed with dirty carpets. SIN was closed outbound which was a minor inconvenience. Overall this is our second trip with Emirates Business and I would definitely travel with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-18;We flew on an Emirates ( Qantas codeshare) Sydney - Paris - Sydney. I strongly advise anyone contemplating this option to forget it. The flight goes to Bangkok where you spend 1-2 hours on the tarmac/transit lounge with the 'joys' of the dual security inspection at Bangkok airport and the usual scam of your duty free bottles etc being confiscated unless you have made the necessary arrangements before hand. Then to Dubai (another couple of hours). The total is close enough to 27 hours from Sydney to Paris. The return flight was worse. Late take off from Paris (unexplained delay nearly two hours) tushed transit in Dubai then a late take off. Then the Bangkok nonsense (and the inevitable late take off). And the food option s- if you don't eat chicken then a diet faces you. Chicken featured as one of two options on every leg every meal and complemented the chicken 'appetiser' - of course you could have chosen the Asian style fish - not an attractive dish.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-16;"I've travelled several times on Emirates nearly all within the Gulf region short economy class flights all fairly decent. This was my first Business Class ""long haul"" London - Dubai then Dubai - Dammam in economy as Business class was full on that sector. I have to say the reality doesn't live up to the hype. The lounge at Heathrow is nice decent selection of food. The flight was full and that told on the cabin crew who looked tired. Inflight entertainment was the best part of the journey. The seat wasn't as comfortable as some carrier I've used the food just a little above the economy standard and the wines middle of the road. No amenity bag toothbrush and razor are in little plastic bags in the toilets. Arriving at Dubai I went to use the Business lounge before my onward connection but was refused access as my onward connection was in economy. Other airlines I've travelled allow access if you have travelled inward on a Business ticket. All in all an average Business class experience but not as exceptional as the publicity would make you believe. Oh Sorry on the onboard bar was a nice touch if only it hadn't closed so early.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-14;DXB to SIN. Airbus A380 business class Dubai to Singapore. Far superior to the Emirates 777 business class seat. Fully flat seat. Loved the walk-up bar and personal refreshment center at my seat. Once again staff just so-so and not better on average than British Air or Lufthansa.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-14;I flew from Washington DC to Ho Chi Minh City 20 hours in economy class. I find Emirates to be quite enjoyable! The in-flight entertainment is excellent with the latest music and movies and TV. The food is excellent! I would travel with Emirates again just for the food. The only negative is the seat comfort but hey you get what you pay for with economy. Toilets are clean and staff are friendly enough. Definitely recommend. I also stayed overnight in Dubai at the Copthorne Airport Hotel and I'd recommend that too.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-14;SEA to DXB. Boeing 777 business class. The actual experience did not live up to all the hype. Had business class seat in Row 8 the bulkhead. Rather than an A/V screen as part of my seat my screen was bolted to the bulkhead. Made for poor viewing experience. Also found the handheld controller to be ridiculously slow. Getting from my window seat to the aisle was a mountain goat experience when the adjacent seat was in sleeping position. Was also surprised to learn the 777 seat was not a 180 degree fully lie flat. Staff were pleasant and attentive but not any more so than British Air or Lufthansa. Food the same as BA and LH. Emirates arrival terminal in Dubai is excellent!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-11;Caught EK71 from Dubai to Paris and it was simply stunning. Staff were fantastic from start to finish food was great and I have no complaints whatsoever. This is one of the worlds great airlines and is really setting the standard for others to follow or not as is the case.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-11;We had a long journey. We flew from Zurich to Hong Kong continued to Bangkok and travelled to Sydney and then all the way back to Switzerland. The Cabin Crew were always very friendly and taking care of our needs. The meals could be better. We will fly Emirates again!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-11;The worst economy flight I have had. The seat was good but the legroom wasn't. The IFE was very nice lots of German movies. Staff were awful. The flight FRA-DXB: Flight was 35 minutes delayed. After take off: Flight attendants went off for about 30 minutes! On our other flights: DXB-SGN: 3 hours delayed SGN-DXB: 1 hour delay. Staff were very slow. They walked 3 times trough the cabin but they didn't see the reclined seat the open seat belt and the fold down table. My bag was on the seat and not in the overhead compartment. The food was good but I will never fly again with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-06;EK6 London to Dubai on 24/25th July and EK 412 Dubai to Sydney on 25th July. Having experienced other airlines in the past we found Emirates to be the worst. The Flight Attendants were rude I lost count how many times they rush past down the aisle and knocked my elbow while I was trying to sleep -there was no apology. Food took forever to be served and by the time they got to you there was no choice as it was whatever was left. Drinks you would think they were paying for them you had to ask for them and when you did it was like you asked them for gold or something. We had to remain on the plane in Dubai for 3 hours before take off to Sydney it was very hot and stuffy after 2 hours of waiting the flight attendant's finally decided to give us some water or juice as everyone was asking for water even then they begrudgingly gave us drinks. Coffee and tea was served half an hour after you had finish your meals and even then it was lukewarm and you only received half a cup. Trays were left in front of you for about an hour and people that had special meals were fed first therefore if they were sitting in front of you and they had finished eating they would put their seat back and you had to manage your tray under your chin until they were collected. My experience with Emirates is definitely memorable but for the negative reasons and I would definitely not recommend them to anyone.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-08-03;June 13th EK433 BNE-DXB with overnight stay at Transit Hotel and on to FRA with EK 45. Boeing 777ER. At Brisbane Airport plane missed turn to active Runway 19 and had to be pushed back resulting in 45 min delay. Apart from that delay everything went well. Unfortunately Emirates still has the 3-4-3 configuration which makes for extremely cramped conditions. Food and Drink service was efficient and even service calls were answered promptly. Toilets were kept clean. In Dubai I stayed at the Transit Hotel and was greeted by a Porter as requested. That is a great service they offer. I would have had big problems finding the hotel. Highly recommended if you need a rest from your travels even though a bit on the pricey side. Next morning after a good rest it was on to Frankfurt.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-03;EK 088 ZRH-DXB 17th July 2014 Airbus A380. What a difference to the B777ER. Wider seats and more legroom plus a big TV screen. ICE worked to a treat and can keep you entertained on these long haul flights. DBX-BNE B777ER. Cabin crew were attentive on both flights but food offered was nothing to write home about. Will fly Emirates again but try to get on the A380 first even if I have to go via Sydney or Melbourne to Europe.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-08-03;July 25 2014 from Hong Kong to Dubai on EK383. I always travel economy class with Emirates. Amongst all the airlines I've travelled they are one of the best in customer service punctuality fairness seat comfort etc. I'm extremely picky when I travel and so far I have not found a chance to complain. My only concern during a couple of the flights (2/10) was that the inflight entertainment monitor could not get adjusted very well.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-31;I did the long haul from Gatwick-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney in economy for all but one leg when I was in business class. I tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. Seat comfort was what you could expect - but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. Luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem. Not an experience I want to repeat especially after they lost our bags.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-31;27 June 2014 HYD-DXB EK 529. 28 June 2014 DXB-HYD EK 203. I have been travelling EK between US and India since 2011. One of the best aspects of EK is that they keep changing their products which makes the passenger experience exciting. This time it was a whole new experience on the A380 between DXB-JFK: the food is simply superb the presentation style has changed - better trays and plates a mini-snack bar with crackers and dips food quality and quantity are great the ICE continues to exceed my expectations and it was lovely to watch it on ipad style 12 inch HD screens with a smooth-touch screen remote! The flight between HYD-DXB on B777-200LR was good older IFEs even with 3-4-3 seat configuration it was comfortable [I am 5'5] but the food was simply excellent! I love the fact that EK gives a hot towel lime water [on flights between DXB and India] a menu card and stainless cutlery for Economy. However it would be nice if the flight attendants could learn to smile more but they always seem to be in a hurry. Overall EK is the most enjoyable way to fly!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-29;Flew economy with my wife Sydney to Dubai 17 July and Dubai to Barcelona 18 July. Both flights flawless. Food definitely edible trays cleared away promptly tea and coffee served after the meal when the trays were being collected. Drink runs every hour or so. Snacks available at each galley during flights. Arrival into Barcelona nearly an hour early but only downside was that baggage took some time to arrive on the carousel. Inflight entertainment superb with huge selection of movies and TV programmes.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-29;Flying from Hong Kong back to the UK on flight EK383 on Thursday 17 July our flight was delayed due to bad weather for four hours some time was made up and arrived in Dubai and the flight EK021 to Manchester was still boarding. Told our seats had been re allocated the result - a five hour wait in Dubai waiting for the next flight. Emirates had jumped the gun so to speak. Why?;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-29;Return Biz class ticket purchased with EK from Muscat to Beijing. On arrival at DXB airport following the flight from Beijing with a 3 hour wait - barred from using the EK Business lounges in Dubai and told that as it is a code share on the last sector (EK ticket) I would not be able to use the Emirates facilities at Dubai airport but must instead use Oman Air! Staff on the business lounge desk most unhelpful. Following a very long walk through DXB airport to terminal 1 no Oman air lounge was found so option was Gulf Air - who (unlike Emirates airline ground staff) were extremely helpful and friendly! Note for the future - avoid flying Emirates business class if possible!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-27;EK161 DXB to DUB on 16 July and EK384 DXB to BKK on 17 June. We still look forward to a decent experience on Emirates that I have read about here on airlinequality.com. Interestingly people I have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on Emirates - I guess we have just been unlucky. Inconsistency is clearly a problem. Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. I travel on a variety of airlines for work and the Emirates service was similar to that of a very bad US airline. Anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad. Would avoid if possible in the future.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-27;QF10 for LHR-DXB connecting to EK380 from DXB-HKG. For the second part of my flight the Emirates A380 experience is just slightly overrated. To start with you could tell that some of the cabin crew were experienced and some were just very new to their job one tried to help a passenger climb over two seats for a toilet run during meal service but were quite clumsy when she dropped the tray of food entirely spilling everything on the aisle. Nevertheless it was evident that the cabin crew tried very hard to impress. What was annoying was the amount of commercials they had on their video screens - other airlines just have safety demonstration videos prior to takeoff but theirs include videos on Dubai the ICE entertainment and skyawards which was slightly unnecessary. The food quality wasn't as good as what was offered aboard Qantas but was still satisfactory. Even if Emirates have been praised over and over again I think it still needs to improve its service consistency and still is not in the same league with airlines such as CX and SQ.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-22;Gatwick to Singapore with a 20 hour stopover in Dubai. Difficult to beat Emirates business class on the A380 in terms of value for money. Only complaint is the shortage of toilets.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-22;Brisbane - Auckland return on A380. Used online check-in both ways and service was great. Completed bag drop very quickly and efficiently in both directions. This was my first return flight Bris-Auck on their A380. Had travelled Dubai/Heathrow Auck/Bris prior to this. Not disappointed. Flight time a lot quicker than 777 and A340 previously used on this route. Boarding was as quick as the smaller aircraft. In the past I have avoided seats in front of the bulkhead however found. Row 50 has plenty of space to recline which avoids disputes with the passenger behind and also gets you off the aircraft quicker.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-22;We have traveled 8 international legs with Emirates in the past 16 months so we have had a good opportunity to check out this airline. It is our experience that they are so focused on their business and first class customers that they do not care about economy despite the huge number of passengers that they cram into economy seating. Food takes so long to be served to economy customer that if you are seated towards the back it is cold once it eventually arrives. It is also our experience that you can expect to have you dinner tray on your tray table for at least on hour after you have finished. Service other than for meals is almost non existent and economy is severely understaffed. Legs out of Dubai to Sydney are particularly bad and the check in processes in Dubai simply terrible - long queues and slow processing. Inflight movies limited. Every time we have flown from Dubai to Sydney there has been a huge hassle with our seating despite having booked our seats months in advance. One time my husband and I were not seated together despite having been allocated seating together - they gave our seats to a sporting group. It is our opinion that this airline does not care about economy class customers. We have flown with many other airlines so have a good idea of the basic standard that one would expect in economy and in our opinion Emirates does not meet event the most basic standard.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-22;I flew AKL-MEL-DXB-JNB with a minor stop in DUR due to OR Tambo Airport (JNB) being closed due to severe weather. Wheels up at Auckland as EK407 at 6.00pm on an Airbus A380 for a 4 hour flight to Melbourne. The food on the first leg to MEL was excellent. It was Mediterranean chicken. We were in MEL for 1.45 hours to fuel up and pick up/drop passengers off. The second leg was 15 hours to Dubai from Melbourne but with the great in flight entertainment systems and comfy seats the time flew past quickly. Early morning arrival into Dubai at 5.20am then for a 5 hour wait to catch flight EK763 which was a Boeing 777-300ER. Great flight until we hit severe turbulence over the middle of Africa. We dropped a couple of feet which was scary but the EK staff kept us calm and served us refreshments after the turbulence had past. Just before we were about to descend into Johannesburg we were diverted to Durban due to bad weather in JNB. We were in Durban for 2 hours but we weren't allowed off the plane. But the EK staff were excellent they gave us refreshments and they were mingling with the passengers. Highly recommend flying with Emirates great seats (economy) in-flight entertainment systems are excellent and the staff are impeccable. I flew JNB-DXB-SYD-AKL on the way back home with the same excellent service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-22;NBO-DXB-SGN on 20-21 July 2014. Travels on Boeings 777-300 and 777-200 respectively. Flights on time. Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer. I was only dissatisfied in DXB with a 40 minutes bus ride from aircraft to gate in the middle of the night - unbelievable and extremely tiring. On board: FAs of superior kindness alertness and professionalism. IFE outstanding. Food: Special meal provided. Other passengers were provided with three options all of acceptable quality. Many soft drinks available. 3 options for beers but all industrial waterish and with a boring taste. Wines tolerable there were 2 red wines in mini bottles and 1 white-wine. DXB-SGN was another tiresome new bus ride for 45 Minutes (including a stop for 20 minutes standing as planes were taxiing. Economy cabin was completely full. Food even better than on the previous flight including special meal. Drinks very generous. Staff did well despite a very crowded economy cabin. Too many seats squeezed in (3-4-3 configuration) which make extremely narrow aisles which hardly can accommodate a trolley. Compared to Qatar Airways Emirates appear to be regaining the lead as (apart from DXB bus experience) they are overall more professional even to customers without status cards.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-20;Flew 2 weeks ago from Ho Chi Minh city (SGN) - (DXB - transit) - LHR (London) and back. My first time flying with Emirates. I was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. After flying for 5 hours I needed my bag with me. Unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when I saw a flight attendant pass by I asked her if she could help. She helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed! On my way back from DXB to SGN I was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. In general the on board entertainment was very impressive. Even though the hot meals were served quickly they didn't taste good the food was incredibly salty and I couldn't finish it. The desserts on the other hand were the best amongst airlines.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-20;A recent trip to Europe with Qantas/Emirates involved three legs with Emirates and one (Dubai to Sydney) with Qantas. Two of the Emirates legs were OK but the leg from Barcelona to Dubai was not up to any realistic standard for economy let alone business class. The food was barely edible (my wife's was inedible) and the service was appalling. No tea or coffee offered after the meal and resentment shown when my wife asked for some. They basically left us alone except for serving the meal. three previous flights with Emirates have been much better. other aspects of the flight (on time check in etc were fine and the Dubai terminal is excellent). The Qantas link with Emirates also works well if flying into Europe without having to go through London. Saves a lot of time.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-20;EK 88 ZRH-DXB 05/03/14. EK 318 DXB-NRT 05/04/14. EK 317 KIX-DXB 05/14/14. EK 87 DXB-ZRH 05/15/14. The best I have experienced! From the chauffeur service to check-in and boarding the service was excellent. The A380 with the shower onboard is fantastic. Food and beverages excellent. I would highly recommend Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-20;Flew economy LGW-AK all cabin crew excellent. Seats on 777 LGW-DUB dub cramped 3x4x3 config. A380 could not fault - great service on all 4 flights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-17;Quick trip to London last weekend. First time on Emirates and not the last. Haven't flown for a long time due to illness and the impatient and entitled behaviour of passengers was disappointing to see as the crew has a difficult job already trying to navigate people's expectations. I have nothing negative to say. Check-in was a breeze each way. Food was fantastic and plentiful. Travelling with children can be stressful at any time but saw crew assisting them and parents with respect and care. Am travelling long-haul again twice in the next 3 months. I'll be going with Emirate again for those.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-17;EK0025 DXB-GLA on 25/11/13 EK0048 FRA-DXB on 4/2/14 and EK434 DXB-BNE on 5/2/14. Poor service. Food is terrible. Ads before watching anything on in-flight entertainment are annoying and seem unnecessary. Treatment of economy passengers is one of disdain as though you are an inconvenience.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-15;SYD-DXB-DUB. DUB-DXB. I have mixed feelings about Emirates. I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build. We were very impressed with the comfort on both the a380 and the 777. Entertainment was my lifesaver.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-15;"Flew Emirates for the 4th time and the in-flight experience keeps on getting better and better! After flying thrice on-board Emirates between the KHI-DXB sector in the past my recent trip with the same airline consisted of two sectors: KHI-DXB-IST (EK601 & EK123) and IST-DXB-KHI (EK 122 & EK600). Aircraft's were their B777-300(ER) which I love although some people might find the 3-4-3 configuration to be a little cramped. The B777-300(ER) aircraft's operated on the two flights during my inbound journey (A6-ENO and A6-ENI) were some of the latest in the fleet and their seats were equipped with the all new ICE Digital Screen which consists of a 12"" IFE Touchscreen and a touch-enabled remote control. Food and beverages were great with sufficient meals and a good variety of drinks. Staff service was good as well. Overall it was an excellent journey.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-12;I have flown with Emirates on and off for the last 10 years and have enjoyed great service over the years and seen a lot of improvements. My most recent flight was LGW to DXB on the A380. This plane is great and the bar / lounge is a must not just a gimmick as seen on other airlines. My only negative is that the meal service has been steadily declining over the years. First the 'As You like It' menu disappears and now it seems that to obtain a glass of wine with your meal you have to wait until you have nearly finished for the wine to appear. Its the little touches that make flying Emirates a pleasure but they need to be maintained otherwise Qatar and Etihad with their dine on demand will gain more business.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-08;BKK-DXB-HAM. BKK-DXB Morning Flight EK375 - long check-in queue but check-in staff at Bangkok were friendly. Delayed 30 mins due to waiting for all passengers to finish boarding. A380 full but still roomy in Y (great aircraft) no highlight - same experience as inbound flight in May - very slow service. As the lunch tray arrived to my row it was cold - quality and quantity under 4 stars airline standard. DXB-HAM on EK 61 (B777-300ER) flight full/ no more to say about the feeling of 3-4-3 seating. On this flight the crew was very rude inexperienced and the poorest inflight-service I have received on EK - very chaotic no system. Crews forgot which seat rows they have already served drinks to and which rows they had not. After meals passengers sitting in seats A to E were served drinks tea or coffee twice while the left hand side passengers (F to K) did not get any. Hours later crews noted this mistake during the collecting of meal trays as the coffee cups were unused and it was too late to serve as we were on landing process and no apology came.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-06;ABJ-DXB-SIN June 22nd-23rd. Good experience overall. Emirates staff improved its service since our previous flights one year ago. On board service is good beverages offered very regularly including on night flights. Food and snacks are excellent. IFE was excellent on the Dubai-Singapore leg but quite average on the Abidjan-Dubai one. Both legs were on B777 and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is quite uncomfortable especially for a 2 times 8 hours journey. But the main setback remains the transfer at Dubai with this incredible and uncomfortable 20 min bus drive from the plane to terminal 3 a bit problematic if you have a short time connection and have to queue to security check and walk across those long corridor to reach your departing gate something Emirates whose traffic is mostly longhaul transited through this Airport should fix.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-06;Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition. Nevertheless Emirates will always remain one of my first choice airlines based on my experiences with them so far.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-06;We arrived in London Gatwick for our 13.35 flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed 6 hours and would not take off until 19.00 so we asked to move/change our connecting flight from Dubai (knowing that we would have missed it for sure) but were told multiple times that it could not be done in the UK but it would have been done quickly in Dubai airport transfer desk. When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. Definitely would not recommend also Airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 2/3 hours.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-07-06;Flew EK385 - A380 BKK to DXB and EK27 - 777-300er DXB to GLA on 5th July. Flew in Economy on both legs and have to say that I was very impressed by the cabin crew who were extremely helpful and friendly on both flights and did an outstanding professional job in looking after me. Food was adequate and very tasty. Planes very modern clean and safety was paramount and the pilots were very exceptional on both flights informing everyone of the route turbulence etc. ICE was very good with plenty up to date movies to keep everyone entertained. I was lucky to be given 3 seats to myself on EK27 even though the flight was fully booked. Both flights were on time and arrived early at both destinations. I really enjoyed my flights and cannot find any faults or complaints.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-06;Flew from Dubai to Delhi on 26th June 2014 and back to Dubai on 6th July2014. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-300 in both the cases. The aircraft was neat and clean but was a bit cramped. The staff isn't that courteous though. The IFE system seemed very old. Overall it was a good experience.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-07-01;Flew BCN-DXB on 23/06 in an A380. Comfortable roomy. Excellent IFE although I didn't avail myself of the myriad of choices - too many violent films. I found that the controls are not all that user friendly (flying to/from Europe). Pleasant staff. Food was fine. Arrived Dubai 00.50 am (24/06) and we had 70 minutes to transfer to our connecting flight. When I requested a priority transfer whilst checking in at Barcelona the staff member was disinterested and unhelpful. It took a lot of fast walking and anxiety but we made our 02.05 am connection DXB- ADL. The Boeing 777 made me realise what cattle class is. Cramped and the seats are appallingly uncomfortable. For the 12hr journey we were served breakfast and lunch hot pizza snacks were handed out only to awake passengers. Chocolate bars and fruit were readily available. Very pleasant staff. The toilets were kept pristine on both legs - very impressed. Aisles in the Boeing are very narrow so that when one is walking for exercise or to the toilet one is constantly bumping other passengers. In our hurry to get our connecting DXB-ADL flight my husband left our camera in the seat pocket of the A38! We spoke to the site manager on our arrival in Adelaide (24/06) and gave him the necessary details. The next day (25/06) I received a call from the Emirates office in Adelaide Airport to say that the camera had been located and that it would arrive on the DXB-ADL flight on Thursday night. So professional so helpful.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-30;I have had 2 return journeys with Emirates to the Seychelles via Dubai from Heathrow within the last 3 months (EK002 & 3) and from Dubai to Seychelles and back and I have to say I was really shocked at how under-performing the cabin crew were. On those separate four journeys I found the Cabin Crew miserable sarcastic rude and looking like they really would like to be anywhere other than where they were. In a nutshell I have left the planes on each occasion really rather appalled at the lack of customer service and I have no wish to fly again with them anytime soon. On one of the flights food was almost thrown at us and scrambling to find anything to give to us as we were last rows of seats on my most recent flight back from Dubai the stewardess just before landing said I will be back (she was collecting blankets and headsets and checking seats were upright etc) but we never saw her again. Air Seychelles I have been told don't fair any better but on my next trip I shall be trying them out flying from Paris direct to the Seychelles which they start from July and see how they do compare because I really don't want to fly Emirates again!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-30;Flight from Newcastle to Brisbane via Dubai and Singapore. We booked in August with Emirates staff promising seats that would be allocated for me being disabled I have severe walking problems that require me to be able to stand up and stretch my legs. What I got were seats in row 37 seats D and E just getting to the seats was extremely hard as I need to use a crutch to walk with the aisles are too narrow to move to the seats while using a crutch. I will never fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-30;First class on this brand new A380-800 from New York to Dubai is truly an excellent flying experience. From the time you board to the time you disembark in Dubai you would never know that you're traveling with 500 other pax! I'm always amazed how Emirates is able to create such an exclusive travel experience in first class while also meeting the demands of the other fellow passengers on the plane. The private suite is spacious the personalized service exceptional the IFE works very well. And then of course there is the shower. Just after take off you book a slot for your pre-arrival shower and this does make a difference after a 13+ hour flight for you walk off that flight feeling refreshed and clean and smelling good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-25;Unfortunately Emirates used an older 777-300ER on this 14+ hour route which is a shame. The biz seat is not entirely flat - the ever so slight angle still makes you slide down when you sleep. I would have preferred to see them use a newer 777-300ER on this route with the full flat bed and place this equipment on a shorter route where sleeping is less important than on an ultra-long haul route. Besides that the service the food the IFE are superb and live up to the Emirates standard.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-25;Flying the A380 from Hong Kong to Dubai in business class you wonder if there is really any point to pay extra for suites given the amazing product that Emirates has in biz class. This was a new A380 with the improved biz seat and a great IFE system. This flight was pure perfection. Well done Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;Beirut-Dubai. Seats were comfortable check in was smooth food was normal and crew responded on time.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;"Flew BKK/SYD 21 June 14. Flight was on time and boarding was efficient and well handled. Staff were professional and friendly with regular water/juice ""runs"" during the night flight. IFE Restroom cleanliness and food quality were at the top of what you expect in economy. Couple of little things that overall left a sour taste from the experience: Arrival cards weren't handed out until exiting the aerobridge on deboarding. Possibly an oversight. The 3-4-3 layout is a real impediment to them living up to their (often announced during the flight) award winning service. 17"" width is simply to little and the extra seat makes the aisles ridiculously narrow to navigate for staff and passengers. My experience is a 3-3-3 format in a 773 is a far more comfortable experience for all. Most budget carriers have the 3-4-3 format however at least on them you don't have further discomfort of impeded foot room ( no IFE boxes under seats.) I guess the extra 50 (?) in carrying capacity is the overarching criteria. Cant help but think the contingent negativity created among passengers overrules the benefits of being able to move the maximum number of people.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;DXB-CMB First Suites B777-300ER. Connected from a BA flight in DXB. EK is not efficient anymore if transferring from another airline with very few staff at the transit desk in Terminal 3. Thankfully a staff member at a non- transfer counter across the corridor saw me waiting and called me over. Although the process was slow he politely issued my boarding pass after confirming that my bags had transferred from BA to EK. The EK First Class Lounge was excellent with attentive staff a nice business center and very good buffet or menu dining options. Boarding was somewhat disorganized as usual. Staff welcomed me at the door showed me my suite and took my welcome drink order. There were two staff members for the five passengers (out of eight suites) with one very attentive and the other indifferent and inexperienced. The suite is very well designed if rather garish but is comfortable and functions well except for the rather awkward sliding doors. No amenity kit is given on the 4.5 hour night flight and no duvet/comforter is offered except for a thick blanket. I had booked a seafood meal online and it was insulting to be served an omelette that looked as though a child had cooked it and contained about a teaspoon of salmon! As one who uses CX and BA First Class and recalls what EK used to do a few years ago this is a huge disappointment. This is a very profitable route for EK yet it is cutting back even in First despite rising fuel costs not yet affecting UAE airlines. As a loyal Silver Tier Skywards EK customer I am concerned to this once outstanding airline is slipping especially when the competition is trying harder on this route. My bags were on the carousel in CMB after I cleared immigration.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;20/6/14 EK88 ZRH-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Pretty new aircraft of 1.3 years old. 85% Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. This time drinks came with salted biscuits 40m after take off. Dinner service 2h30m after take off and drinks came 30m later. This left many passengers parched and kept asking crew for drinks which they weren't very happy to oblige on this leg. There was no menu as well not sure if crew forgot or there was insufficient. Dinner was really good with choices between salmon with saffron risotto and grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I had the latter. Chicken breast a little dry but went well with the sauce. My mother had the salmon and the risotto was really delicious. Dessert of lemon torte was really good and I could have had multiple servings. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Staff service was terrible on this flight the worst flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Hardly any smiles during service which honestly does not matter call buttons by other passengers went unanswered. No drinks service after the meal service. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. I asked for 2 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and a rude male crew told me to get back to my seat and ask for it later. Not recommended this time. On a positive note a family of passengers who ordered Indian vegetarian meals didn't have their meals loaded and a female cabin crew were extremely helpful even going to business class to get a sandwich for them.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;13/6/14 EK71 DXB-CDG. Boarding very orderly by zones. Sparkling new aircraft of 0.6 years old. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Snack service 1h after take off and drinks another 30m later. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach and scrambled eggs with hash browns. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff creamed spinach really good. Fruits were fresh too. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread made me feel like I'm in France already. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was really good on this flight the best flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they even asked me to sit down and they'll return the bottle to me. I asked for 3 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and they obliged as well with a smile. Excellent service beats SQ on this leg. EK is really good if you get an awesome crew like this.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;SFO-DXB-CGK on 20th June. Flight out of SFO got delayed for 4 hours. Lounge manager at SFO not helpful at all on the border of being unprofessional. Business class seats are small. Otherwise all other services are fine.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;Toronto to Dubai Dubai to Perth then Perth to Dubai and Dubai to Toronto. EK 242 EK 422 EK 421 EK 241. The seat was comfortable the food was good and the service was great. The only two things I didn't like was the lack of self serve snacks and the amount of time it took for the crew to clear the meal trays.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;12/6/14 EK355 SIN-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Interior well maintained despite plane being 7-8 years old. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like SQ and CX does. Dinner service 1.5 hrs after take off and drinks another 30m later. People's throats were parched by then. People then begun pressing call buttons this could have been avoided if a simple drink run was done. Food was really good with choices between sweet and sour chicken and beef with mashed potatoes. I had the former and dessert was good too. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. No drink runs nor snacks provided after that although menu said so that was disappointing so 1 star less for F&B.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-23;21/6/14 EK354 DXB-SIN. Boarding not by zones this time and some confusion occurred at the gate. Middle aged aircraft by EK's standards 4.4 years old well maintained interior but my seat pocket had a bit of uncleared rubbish. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her. As usual EK is really good if you get a good crew. Only disappointment this flight was the food.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-20;Flew to Los Angeles in April. Food on the 04.30 am flight from Bangalore to Dubai was terrible as usual. The flights on the double decker A380 aircraft from Dubai to LAX and back was very comfortable. The massive queues to board the aircraft long queues at check-in and the scramble for the baggage at LAX airport will deter me from choosing this aircraft in future. It took me 2 hours to get my baggage at LAX airport and with 500 pax searching for their suitcases it was a total mess! Food portions on the flight were very small and food was disappointing. For a 16 hour flight the in between meal snacks were just fruits and chocolates which vanished soon and were never refilled. The crew were unfriendly. Ask for a drink and it never comes until you remind them thrice. Very disappointed. The food on the Dubai/Bangalore sector was excellent.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-20;"More food please! On a trip from SYD to London we were only served 2 meals and one ""light bite"". That's over 23 hrs flying with just 2 measly meals. Meal service is appalling. No drinks or snacks served. No pre-drinks served before meals or at any time during the flight. Drinks (tea coffee juice wine etc) served over 30 mins after meals are delivered. No second round of tea /coffee served Service is slow milk and sugar need to be requested and served separately and this takes forever By the time tea is served it is cold and too late after the meal has been eaten.";NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-06-20;Vastly overrated. The staff may be good at delivering food but have very little idea of what service means. I did 5 sectors in first and met one Purser and one person who claimed to be in charge of the first class cabin. On two sectors I was addressed by my name on three I was just another person. Staff seem to not want to engage with passengers or communicate with them except to take food orders. On two sectors I had to go and search for cabin staff - none seemed to be around when found they were all talking in the galley and appeared upset that I had interrupted them. As best I can determine there is only one first class lounge and that is in Dubai all the others are business class shared with first. On the plus side the suites are great and the beds excellent.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-20;Upgraded from Economy to Business SYD-DXB on A380. Sydney lounge is one of the best around with respect to the food and wines. Best breakfast lounge menu ever. A380 business class seat superb rivals Cathay although I'm not sure why it needs touchscreen + handset + tablet to operate the IFE. That said it all worked seamlessly and very good quality screen. Food was fantastic from the main meals served to the in between meals (a highlight) to the finger food in the lounge at the rear of the plane. The lounge is fantastic - it sets them apart from the other high quality business offerings pity it's only on A380s but then they have a massive A380 fleet anyway. Staff were great but a little over friendly at times. Will be my first choice from now on.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-20;DXB-CDG and NCE-DXB-SYD. Great economy class with comfortable seats great IFE quality food (particularly impressive) and very good staff. Difficult to fault. Lounges are mixed bag DXB terminal C for breakfast wasn't great but plenty of space Nice airport lounge is very average but better than nothing DXB terminal B for dinner on the way back was fantastic. Very happily fly with them again. Saw staff taking Polaroid's of couples on the 777 from NCE to DXB and then giving them as a gift (I think) - very unusual but thought it was quite a nice touch.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-18;Emirates has got to be the best value for money for any premium carrier. The pick up from home is excellent they will take you to an airport hotel the night before. Check in was friendly quick and efficient. The lounges in Manchester and Dubai are lovely and peaceful. The food was good and the Wifi works. We will gloss over the Bidvest lounge in Cape Town. The suite has everything you could possibly want. The seat have everything from upright to completely flat. The food was absolutely first class the wines were excellent and the service from the crew was attentive and friendly.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-18;LAD-DXB-BKK. Flights comfortable and staff very nice. You get up and go to the back for a drink as after the meal they have a staff party and relax. Fair enough. Dubai airport isn't my cup of tea. Duty free cheap and beer expensive. Give me Schipol any day. Good airline. Good entertainment system. Comfortable in economy.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-17;Recent trip with Emirates from DUB/DXB/SYD in First. I was going out to Townsville in Northern Queensland for about a week to help my daughter celebrate a big birthday. My wife had travelled out a week in advance of me and returned a week after me. Chauffeur pick up to and from Dublin Airport worked extremely efficiently. Travelling out on 27th May in DUB Emirates use the DAA lounge which is fairly basic with it's services. Hopefully in September when they increase their schedule to two flights each day from DUB they will have their own lounge. The four flights were all in general very good with respect to service comfort etc. The FA on the return from SYD/DXB was absolutely superb. The staff on the final leg from DXB/DUB were not quite up to the general standard shown on the previous flights. I have flown in First with Malaysian Singapore (a lot) and Etihad and I would certainly be happy with the Emirates product.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-17;Bangkok - Hong Kong First class June 15. Although trip had a rocky start. Emirates lounge closed forced to use Qantas facilities followed by 30 minute delay including horrible boarding experience. Once aboard the 380 all was forgiven. Warm gracious service perfect light meal suitable for the short flight and the wonderful ICE system. First class aboard Emirates is the best.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-17;DXB-ARN on 15 June 2014 on a 777 200 LR. What a wonderful flight service on board was great and a super crew friendly helpful and very professional. 2 hours to landing and during lunch service an announcement for emergency landing was called due to a medical situation. We landed in Moscow and the crew acted very professionally considering the short time notice collected the lunch trays drinks prepared the cabin for landing and ensured the safety of the passengers on board. Almost 2 hours on the ground to finish the emergency landing process and refuel before heading on a short flight to Stockholm. Well done Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-13;I flew Emirates for the first time return Glasgow to Dubai. My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow). Both my drivers were excellent cars were extremely comfortable and on time. I will most certainly be using Emirate again in the future.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-12;Flight ok. SYD to New Zealand flight was late 30 minutes causing us to miss connecting flight. Was unable to get a response from them after 3-4 emails using the Emirates email given to meet the Emirates rep inside the airport. Finally got hold of someone on the phone who said she could not help me. So the flight and carrier were comfortable and pretty polite - unless you end up needing customer service for something. Then it's very difficult to resolve a problem.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-12;Flew Wellington - Sydney - Bangkok return. Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline. I have flown several times with Emirates and am a member of their skywards programme and this is the first significant complaint normally they are very good.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-12;"LGW-DXB-MNL round trip Economy. Excellent and very efficient Check-in at LGW and very generous 42kg baggage allowance for Skywards Silver. On time Departures and Arrivals for all flights apart from MNL-DXB which was 1.5 hours late in leaving MNL due to ""Immigration Delays"" for 15 passengers. Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices. The IFE on Emirates is still amongst the best on any airline and eases the journey considerably. Good value on the ticket price and I'll continue to use Emirates as my first choice.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-12;"We flew airbus A380 Manchester-Dubai and returned on the 777. Both planes were excellent and the entertainment system was 2nd to none. I found the seats to be adequate although I have read some concerns about the width we did not find this but both my wife and myself are average height and build at 5 ft 10"". We were however lucky enough on our return journey to have booked just 2 adjoining seats at the rear of the plane which we found really good as there was a bit more room at that point in the aisle as well and we were far enough away from the toilets not to be annoyed by any queue. However my only gripe would be the complimentary drink situation If you are happy to have a drink just when the food is served then its not a problem for you but my wife and myself do like a drink more often than this and class a 7 hour flight with great entertainment almost as one of our nights out (especially on the outward bound flight) Now I don't know what other people would say is over the top but I would quite easily get through 6 or 7 of the little wine bottles they provide in this period of time but found it hard to be served 3. I really did have to keep asking to get any more and on 2 occasions was acknowledged but no wine brought to us. I would have quite happily purchased some at this point but obviously its all complimentary so I couldn't even do this. I have a suspicion that the staff are trained to spot people who may want more alcohol than what they deem to be average consumption and enforce delay tactics to slow you down and felt they were avoiding eye contact with me when passing. They ignored the ""call service"" light on our seat completely and I had to eventually keep getting up and going to the galley where they were. This did spoil the flight to some extent as even when we are on a flight where we have to pay we would have had more than this The food however was again very good.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-10;Flew BLR-DXB-FCO and IST-DXB-BLR. All flights were B777-300ER. Good seats and excellent ICE entertainment systems. I Had all window seats which we very comfortable and had enough legroom. Food and beverages served were good but took a long time take away the trays. Overall good and satisfactory experience and would surely consider travelling again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-10;London-Dubai-Dhaka and Dhaka-Dubai-London - Business Class. Average service apart from the Dubai to London leg on our way back this was terrible! The cabin crew member who looked after us clearly didn't want to be on the flight she seemed uninterested and tired from the start of the flight. Food wasn't business class standard at all. The sandwich was extremely oily which I didn't like and sent back the replacement - biriyani (main course) was dry followed by sad looking dry sandwiches for afternoon tea and there was no brownie after the sandwiches as the menu stated.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-09;Flight from Heathrow to Dubai very good on the A380 comfort service and entertainment all good. Changing aircraft at Dubai for Perth was appalling. Had to get 2 lifts a 6 minute train ride a 15 minute walk and then an 8 minute bus ride from the gate out to the plane and then a climb up a large flight of steps to the plane. Had no time to use the business class lounge as the transfer gate was so far from where the first leg of the journey arrived. This may have been due to all the construction going on everywhere at the airport. My advice would be to avoid Dubai if possible for at least a year until they are better organised.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-09;PER-DXB-SEA and LHR-DXB-PER. I have flown Emirates many times now all these flights were fantastic. Departed and arrived on time service great on all flights and apart from out of Perth all meals were delicious including the best economy meal I have ever eaten on one flight.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-08;AMS-CPT via DXB. Easy check in at AMS and departure area spacious and good control of boarding. Had rear row to myself so able to stretch out. Transfer at DXB straightforward but does involve a fair amount of walking and a train connection. But well signed. Flight to CPT on B777. Fairly full but comfortable. Staff great as I usually find and very helpful. Special meal provided as ordered. ICE entertainment excellent. Flights arrived on time or within 30 mins of schedule.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-08;BEY-DXB-LHR Economy. Emirates continue to set the overall bench mark. Flawless crew and aircraft all on a very well priced ticket. But the food standards have dropped dramatically or should I say the product has somewhat become much cheaper and basic. This is a pity. Food on both sectors was only edible because people were hungry. I note that Alcoholic drinks are kept generally hidden from the public eye to perhaps give the impression that they are not available. The fabulous ICE IFE has somewhat shrunk too. But again they are probably the best overall.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-05;19th May CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LHR 31st May LHR-DXB-BKK-SYD-CHC. On all legs apart from DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB flew on 777-300er and on the DXB legs A380. I have to agree with others who have written about the cramped conditions imposed by the use of 3x4x3 cabin layout and the impact it has on both passenger comfort and cabin crew mobility. Of the two aircraft's I flew on I found the window seat most comfortable on the 777-300er curvature of the aircraft body interior on the A380 ate into what little legroom there was. The cabin crew for the most part was professional and good at their job however on the flight from DXB-LHR there was an issue regarding careless parents and a wilful toddler intent on roaming the aisle and not strapped in as we prepared for take off which an obviously inexperienced FA did not have the confidence to deal with. I found all food offered and on such a long series of flights there was a lot of food offered to be acceptable not amazing but acceptable and the drinks service adequate. If I asked for anything it was brought promptly and with good grace. On my return journey I had a crashing headache and had nothing to take for it in my carry-on. When asking if there was anything onboard for a headache a FA swiftly brought me two Panadol and a glass of water for which I was most grateful. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel used for my Dubai Connect transit stop. I was taken to the Arabian Park hotel and having read some of the horror stories about the Copthorne I was pleased with my allocation. However it was not easy or clear where I was to go to at DXB to avail of the Dubai Connect offer as there is no signage for it specifically and it was trial and error that found it and not due to any help from staff at DXB. If I have any complaints at all about my flights they are mostly about some of my fellow passengers who seemed to go out of their way to make the rest of us uncomfortable and the irrational 3x4x3 cabin layouts. One of these things Emirates can change the other they can't. My final thoughts about my flights are this and one concerns the blatant disregard many of my fellow passengers had for the carry on baggage protocols. The lack of enforcement regarding carry on quotas results in overhead bins being so stuffed that some of us had no space to stow baggage of legitimate size and quantity anywhere near our seats. The other being the reliance of the IFE system to divert us from the cramped cabin conditions. Let's face it no movie is going to stop FAs bumping passengers in aisle seats or avert the ridiculous situation of a 3x4x3 cabin layout.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-05;EK418 BKK-CHC via SYD. Fantastic as usual. Comfortable 777-300ER no issues at all. Crew were superb all the way food was exceptional and the alcohol flowed freely. ICE movies and music exceptional. Arrived on time into SYD and early into CHC. Emirates really are up there with the best of them.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-05;I took flight EK405 from Melbourne to Singapore. My Flight was at 1800 and it departed on time. The cabin crew were very helpful and its customer service was great. The personal television was big and there was a great choice of movies. The cabin lighting was great too. I took the B777-300ER and the seating arrangement was 3-4-3. It was rather cramped but the overall experience was great and I would recommend and definitely take Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-05;CHC-BKK via SYD codeshare with QF. Departed Christchurch on QF138 737-800 plane full service ok food quality ok and served with a smile. Unfortunately we were seated right down the back by the toilet so after breakfast people queued beside us to use. Landed in Sydney then transferred to QF A330 to BKK. Old plane broken seat great crew made up for it. I don't understand why Emirates has joined up with Qantas the Emirates experience is far superior to what Qantas can offer.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-05;I flew on 777s from Sydney to Bangkok to Dubai to Geneva. Nice food and good entertainment. The first two legs were full planes and the service suffered because of it. The staff were pretty scarce for much of these flights but they were responsive if you managed to get their attention. I thought it a bit unprofessional that they were often chatting and laughing at the back of the plane while the poor people sitting back there tried to sleep. On the last leg the plane was only half full and the service much better. But at least 20 screens weren't working at all - luckily there were lots of other empty seats to move to.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-04;LHR-DXB-LHR. First flight on the Emirates A380. Compared to B777 seats were wider but legroom felt the same. Flight was quieter and smoother than B777. Check in in LHR was good with no queuing and friendly staff. Check-in in DXB no so good 20 minute queue with certain locals known to Airline staff being allowed to jump queue. Check in agent did not smile once. Boarding on both flights very efficient with no queuing or crowding on aircraft or airbridge. Service on outbound flight no so good no drinks served until after meal only one trolley drink service and no breakfast or food before early morning 6.30am arrival. Long wait for trays to be collected. Service on return better with drinks service before and after meal and light afternoon staff. Again long wait for trays to be cleared. Adequate number of toilets on flights with no significant queuing. In flight entertainment superb with good quality screen let down by poor control sensitivity.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-04;"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive. Sad really because the aircraft and the product is very good. Just delivered very poorly. My airline of choice is BA.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-02;We travelled from Heathrow-Dubai-Cape Town. The aircraft was a 777 all sectors this airline has to be the most uncomfortable and over rated. The seats were crammed in 3x4x3 so narrow and with narrow aisles to. The whole experience was exhausting. The staff were indifferent and you could tell they couldn't wait to get off and avoid the suffering stares from the trussed up passengers. I would suggest think long and hard before booking if the aircraft is a 777. I understand most airlines had 3x3x3 set up which is civilised. Food was ok TV ok and all on time. Transfer at Dubai ok nothing special though.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-06-01;LHR-DXB-HKT. Codeshare with Qantas on way out for first leg of the journey. Emirates for the 2nd keg and both sectors for the return. Very nice and able to use BA Business lounge at LHR. Had an excellent vegetable curry before the flight. Arrived at Dubai and followed signs for gate and Business lounge only to be told we were at the terminal. Signage was poor and quite a few other people made the same mistake. Phuket airport was confusing as the terminal is not well signed. Again business class so whisked through security and passport control so no need to queue. Coral Lounge at Phuket is very small and serves First and Business class it is also a lounge were you can pay to enter. NO wines or spirits are on offer was told to go outside and buy wine if I wanted it. The toilets are also a few minutes walk away from the lounge. Dubai again on way back and was told the gate was B16 (the terminal we were at). Luckily I noticed on the departure board that it had changed to A13. No announcement so not sure if anyone missed the flight as it entailed another shuttle train to B gates. New A380 plane and was very nice food etc all good as were the staff.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-06-01;EK751 Dubai to Casablanca on May 8th 2014. Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. And when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. This airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-28;Flight EK 421 Perth to Dubai 6th May 2014. I have flown the Glasgow to Perth via Dubai route several times however this was by far the worst experience economy was full and as anyone that has flown on the Emirates 700-300 will know due to the 3x4x3 seat configuration how cramped this can be. For long periods of time sometimes up to an hour despite there not being turbulence the seat belt sign was kept on so people couldn't go to the bathroom despite cabin crew walking around freely resulting in long queues when the sign was turned off. It made for an uncomfortable 10.5 hour flight. Connecting flight to Glasgow was okay.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-27;My flights were EK16 LGW-DXB 26 May 2014 connecting EK384 DXB-BKK 27 May 2014. Ground staff both at Gatwick and Dubai were polite and friendly. Very quick and smooth checking in and boarding. Both flights were on time. Cabin crews were definitely helpful smiley and attentive. F&B were quite nice. I chose yoghurt chicken curry with rice from Gatwick and Chicken Congee from Dubai. Toilets and cabin were kept clean. Inflight entertainment with live news so many choices of movies TV shows games and music. Large individual screen though. My headset from EK384 DXB-BKK wasn't working but I got another one which was fine. It was my first time flying with EK and I must say everything was beyond my expectation. I'm absolutely impressed by their excellent services. Much better than Etihad's. Worth every penny. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-27;HAM-DXB: Check-In Staff at HAM extremely rude. I had a long discuss about the weight of my handbag. EK allows strictly only 7 kg. handbag incl. Cameras Laptop reading materials umbrella. As per IATA rule those carry-on personal items can be carried free of charges into the cabin without weighing and counting to the handbag but not by EK. HAM-DXB on EK 62 (B777) late evening flight took off at 21.25 Hrs. Very cramped seats and very slow service I got my dinner served at 23.30 hrs 2 hours after take-off. After 5 hours transit at DXB airport for onward flight to BKK with EK 372 (A380). After boarding we were informed about the 2 hours delay but we were not allowed to get off the aircraft so had to sit in the full A380 (fortunately seats are more comfortable than B777) with no drink or meal service. During the delay crews were hidden and enjoyed talking with themselves in the galleys. After taking off with a 2 hours delay crews still needed another 2.5 hours before starting to serve meals to hungry passengers. Quality and quantity of food was poor. Only 1 drink was served 1 hour later. After 2 hours trays were collected with the offering of tea or coffee. Poor cleanliness during the flight toilets were not cleaned or controlled. I notified the crew that one toilet had run out of tissue but nothing happened.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-26;My spouse and I flew first class Christchurch-Sydney-Dubai-Frankfurt 16 November 2013. Our second flight on our return itinerary (outward from Frankfurt to Christchurch was also with Emirates in Business Class) Sydney to Dubai was cancelled due to a rainstorm at Sydney airport which meant we had to deplane after approx three hours on board and spend all night in Sydney airport waiting for our luggage to be returned and then re-queue to be re-booked on a new flight. It was an A380 so there were hundreds of people involved yet almost no Emirates Staff available or information provided. At re-check-in we asked to be re-routed to Paris rather than Frankfurt as we realised that the new routing to Frankfurt meant we would not be able to reach Brussels - our final destination by train connection the same day and so would have to stay in a hotel overnight in Germany. We made repeated requests to be re-routed and we knew there was availability in the first class cabin on the Paris flight. Yet despite all our requests nobody seemed prepared to understand our predicament or accede to our request. We also noticed that the level of service – nd attitudes of staff - differed substantially across flights. While some were outstanding such as the First Class leg from Christchurch to Sydney (probably because we were the only people in the first class cabin) service on other legs was sometimes surly and when our problems arose on the return leg we had the impression that staff were more interested in keeping us quiet and fobbing us off than sincerely wanting to help resolve our travel dilemma. For example the Senior Purser onboard suggested we use their on-board WiFi and telephone service to enquire about being re-scheduled onto the Paris flight as it was “not very expensive” - I later discovered a €50 charge on my credit card statement! Upon landing in Dubai we enquired with ground staff about changing to the later flight to Paris but Dubai ground staff shouted at us that we were obliged to take the Frankfurt flight as our luggage had already been checked through to Frankfurt and that we would have to pay penalties for changing our routing. So all in all we have at best mixed feelings about our Emirates Experience in-flight given what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime in First Class but definitely disappointed at their mediocre response to a fairly simple request to be re-routed and lack of customer care afterwards. All-in-all we probably will not be travelling with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-26;BKK-LGW-BKK. The aircraft are fairly new and in good shape as you'd expect. The service is very hit and miss mostly a miss. On one leg shortly after takeoff the crew distributed promising looking menu cards but this was just a tease since no food materialised until almost 5 hours into a 6 hour flight. The purser spent the flight in and out of the understair workstation adjacent to my seat on the A380 slamming the door each time. When the food did arrive it was poor. On another leg the food was served in the first couple of hours and was very enjoyable being salmon and mashed potatoes. They seemed quite happy to bring the odd glass of wine throughout all the flights. On one leg we were bussed to the aircraft at Dubai which was strangely parked in a very remote part of the airfield. All those gates at Dubai and we end up having a 20 minute bus ride and climbing steps to the aircraft. The customer service at Gatwick was very poor. Although the ground staff had all week to advise me of a requirement regarding my return flight (I visited their desk on several occasions) they failed to do so and waited until I arrived at check in with all my bags and then turned me away. If you have cause to contact Emirates with a complaint after you've flown they seem to be very reluctant to provide email addresses or forms for this purpose.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-23;Colombo to Amsterdam via Dubai and Paris to Colombo via Dubai. Food was fantastic excellent inflight entertainment. Staff very attentive will use Emirates again. Flew in A380 as well.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-23;Flight from Perth (Australia) to Dubai did not meet expectations. Despite the airlines supposed reputation the food quality and choice was very poor. The touchscreen was insensitive and caused considerable frustration when trying to select particular films or music. Most notable the staff were surly and generally unhelpful. This was one of the worst flights I have ever endured !;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-21;Lisbon to Luanda via Dubai. In the past I used TAP Portugal to go Luanda but due to delays high fares old aircraft and poor service I changed. Emirates is a cut above the rest flights were on-time main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and more space than competition food was delicious crew professional and helpful. I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in economy class.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-20;BKK-DXB-FRA-DUS-DXB-BKK . Limousine chauffeur on time Qantas lounge in BKK as Emirates under renovation excellent day flight to Frankfurt no amenities but its a day flight so no problem good choices of entertainment. on my return I pampered myself in First amazing service and I had the best sleep of my life up in the air. excellent food and wine list. Crew as usual very helpful and nice.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-20;CPT-DXB Boeing 777-300. Comfortable flight friendly and efficient cabin crew. Lunch & dinner serving outstanding. Staff made the flight as pleasant as possible. ICE inflight entertainment system with excellent choices.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-19;PER-DXB-HAM. My first experience with Emirates Business Class. Started very well with the Chauffeur car. Staff at check in good. Lounge nicely presented. IFE in my seat did not work. Luckily seat next to me vacant. Impressive looking seat was surprisingly narrow and no elbow room. Found it hard to get comfortable. No amenity pack offered on either sector all the way to Hamburg. Found it very difficult to choose something I wanted to eat. Food too middle eastern with no choice offered friendly crew. Lounge in Dubai awful. Probably the worst I've had for a while. Far too overcrowded. HAM-DXB-PER: Chauffeur pick up lounge nice but hard to find. Much better flight than outbound. Same issue with food although this time I ate in the lounge where the food had more of a western flavour to it. Staff friendly and helpful. Different seat with better elbow room. IFE is a little awkward to use. My bag was damaged on arrival in Perth. The baggage services team in Perth were very helpful and my bag was replaced. As a Qantas frequent flyer this was a rewards trip so I'm not too devastated by the experience. If I had to spend full price on a business class fare I would probably look elsewhere. The lounge in Dubai and the seats being the major turn offs.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-18;CPT to LHR via DXB in economy. Two full planes Boeing 777 and A380. Staff excellent helpful and pleasant. Both arrived early or on time. Boarding done by row numbers and well controlled. Seating on 777 narrower but I found more comfortable than the A380. Entertainment vast and varied. Food ok. But why do airlines still insist on providing hot breakfasts in the very early hours which are so unappetising. My poached eggs could have survived a set at Wimbledon! And three hours before landing at 4am when I had just got off to sleep - surely no need. I can't believe passengers want this - a light and healthy snack 90 mins before landing would be more preferable. Going for fruit platter meals in future. Off loaded at LHR quickly and despite a busy terminal through immigration and customs within 30mins of landing.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-18;MAD-DXB-BKK Business Class (Frequent Flyer Gold Card holder) traveling approximately bi-monthly for over two years. I've noticed a marked deterioration in quality on this service and my last two flights have had problems which need bringing to the attention of a wider audience. I note from comments on this site that others have noted a similar deterioration in service on Emirates. On the first flight I was double charged by the airline. When I pointed this out to the Service Center I was initially told I was incorrect. After a second e-mail and a delay I was informed by another individual I had to prove that I had been overcharged. When I did this I was then told by a third employee to enter certain information via the web to obtain a refund. I tried several times but the information was clearly wrong. After a further delay a fourth employee suggested I was entering the data incorrectly. I tried again: same result. I then asked the matter to be escalated. No reply. Eventually after further e-mails a fifth employee agreed that the matter should be escalated. Over a month later I received an incomplete refund and a lame excuse for an apology. On my last flight EK385 the service was awful. My breakfast was initially not delivered. After trying to attract the attention of staff my meal some 45 minutes late was slammed down. it was as might be expected after being allowed to stew for that amount of time inedible. After asking for the Purser a 'Senior' eventually arrived who tried various displacement techniques to avoid apologising. I eventually forced an apology and was asked if I wanted 'something' (unspecified) to replace the disgusting plate. By this time the plane was descending. I asked again to see the Purser who eventually turned up and mumbled on about 'the girl' who was responsible. She disappeared to make the safety announcement prior to landing and I never saw her again. I have received no recompense. I would suggest that if you experience problems on Emirates don't expect prompt service genuine apologies or any recompense. You will have to deal with an obstructive Service Center staffed by arrogant and essentially incompetent individuals and an on board 'crew' who regard themselves as a superior class of persons who unless you are prepared to ingratiate yourself find providing a service beneath them. As there is ample choice of airlines on this route I certainly wont fly Emirates again and would advise caution if anyone is considering it as the alternatives which I have recently sampled are infinitely superior.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-17;"SYD-AKL-SYD and SYD-AKL-SYD my work booked these flights. To say the staff are rude is an understatement. Onboard staff were only interested in quickly serving the meals and you didn't even have time to finish eating off your tray before they whipped them away. Any rubbish left over they weren't interested in picking up with their precious little fingers. I buzzed for duty free for an hour and asked 3 people if I could buy some and kept getting told ""I'll tell the girl I'll tell the girl"" or ""she should be coming through"" only to find that ""she"" couldn't be bothered. Ground staff at both airports were rude and I was looked down on (it felt) for a being a Qantas business customer. Rude arrogant staff.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-17;LHR-Auckland- LHR via Dubai April/May 2014 in A380. I thought the comfort of the A380 economy seats was better than other planes entertainment fantastic service good. The food wasn't always to my taste but that is my problem. All legs of the journey were on time would recommend.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-17;BNE to FRA via DXB. Staff pleasant helpful and enthusiastic. Aircraft clean and looks modern and well maintained. Well stocked personal minibar. Punctual. Great food IFE is fantastic. I've done four flights with Emirates and will continue to fly with them. Pity they don't do transPacific flights to US/Canada.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-16;ARN-AKL via DXB and SYD in Business. Very comfortable lounge in ARN. Clean aircraft ARN-DXB with attentive and pleasant FAs but come across as a bit inexperienced. Slow drink service during dinner and food ok but not great. The Business seat a bit cramped for my taste. Had the Dubai connect service at DXB (because of a long lay-over the airline puts you up in a hotel arranges transport and visa for you) and that was great. Nice to have a good bed for the night in an excellent hotel. Immigration into and out of Dubai very quick. Lounge in DXB was excellent (have a hard time understanding all the negative reviews about this - but admittedly did not use washrooms or showers. Food was great). Flight from DXB to AKL via SYD in 380. Excellent seat. Again very pleasant FAs but again somewhat inexperienced appearing. Again very slow drink service. Was given a before dinner drink. Then no drink with the starter but with the assurance that it was coming. It came when the starter was finished. Then the main meal arrived but no drink. That came after the meal was finished. Those things are not the end of the world but it comes across as somewhat unprofessional. Lounge in SYD was fine with nice shower and flight from SYD to AKL had a new crew that seemed more experienced. Overall though I was pleased especially considering the cost was significantly lower than on competing airlines. So in spite of missing out on a glass of wine or two I will do this again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-15;Auckland/Dubai/LHR economy connecting flight EK 1 to LHR delayed at Dubai for over 1hr but no explanation given by ground staff in fact appeared unprofessional not until on the aircraft did you get an adequate response from the captain who gave a full explanation. By coincidence my leg from Heathrow to Dubai was also delayed exactly 2 weeks earlier so wonder if they have a scheduling problem. The A380 is a huge aircraft and with its size comes big logistics the cabin crew were not particularly attentive and water for such a long flight was offered very infrequently and the service was not anywhere near the service I had been given by Asiana Airlines to Auckland a year earlier.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-13;I travelled from Manchester to Hong Kong via Dubai. All flights were on-time the aircraft were modern clean and the food was good. The crew were professional friendly and helpful.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;Dubai - Male 22nd February 2014 Flight EK0652. On the morning of 22nd February we boarded the flight in Dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. We were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. Told that once we left the plane an Emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. After we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options 'arrivals' or 'transfers' and no-one had any idea where to go and no help was available. We saw a few Emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. We queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes! We asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. The lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. Finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am Sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until Monday. This debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am Sunday. The journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight. The absolute worst part was having absolutely no information forthcoming - it was an absolute disgrace.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;This airline was not at all child friendly and we had many problems. The transit in Dubai involved a bus trip over 30 minutes long standing in a hot stuffy bus. Some of our kids were given activity packs on the aircraft and some were not. The allergy meals although not containing the specified allergen contained many other common allergens such as eggs fish and seafood. The meat for these meals was always fish. We did not receive the diabetic meal we ordered on every flight. Staff on the A380's are immature and more concerned with enjoying the trip themselves and their own comfort. No drinks were offered between meals on the return A380 flight. The crew spent their time gossiping in the service areas. Our flight on the return trip was changed and we weren't notified until we tried to check in. These are just some of the highlights but overall the experience was very stressful.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;"VIE-DXB after taking off the bassinet on the wall was installed quickly amenity kit distributed and even blankets with collectible monsters. When I asked the crew to fill up our babybottle with hot water this was done in less than 10 minutes. DXB-MNL the crew seemed very tired and unmotivated. I am just wondering why the ""sparkle"" of the crew was missing? Even at the flight back the crew was so-so at the first leg but at the second leg they tried their best. Emirates takes good care of their passengers food service excellent ground handling (handled by Austrian Airlines in Vienna) was great as the Supervisor blocked the seat next to us so we could rest better and I think its a big plus for Emirates that they lend Strollers in DXB to families.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;DXB-ARN-DXB. Biz class return In short both these flights were of a high calibre especially the return leg on the 08/05 ARN-DXB the Purser was an English lady who is a total asset to the airline. Her manner with passengers was professional yet friendly and she and her team gave an excellent service. Both legs service was top notch flights on time and arrived early. ICE as usual had the latest movies and seat comfort superb. My only small gripe again is the food Biriyani in Biz class is not acceptable  I chose the Veal which was chewy and tough and had to return it. Wines were good. Failing that a great set of flights!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-11;I went from Dusseldorf to Singapore and back with Emirates. The service was great! One thing I really liked was that the cabin crew members were very open towards me. They weren't treating me like a customer but like a friend. The food was excellent as well and the seats were provided with TV's. There were lots of films and music to pick. The cabin crew also provided us with blankets before we started flying. This was excellent since I wanted to sleep immediately. To be honest I can't really say anything bad about Emirates. Great airline.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-10;London Gatwick - Dubai EK016 1/5/2014. Dubai - Kuala Lumpur EK346 2/5/2014. I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-10;LGW-AKL in First A380 all the way. As usual an extremely good product extremely well delivered. Pricing out of LGW was more competitive than via LHR which is nearer my home but the included chauffeur service meant the added distance and time were negligible. The lounge at LGW despite being under renovation still served top-class food (as do most EK lounges worldwide) with an impressive Margaux to sip. Staff were very courteous. All sectors (LGW- DXB DXB-SYD and SYD-AKL) were excellent - slept reasonably well superb selection of modern films on the IFE high quality cabin crew. The shower spa is a fantastic luxury that I continue to thoroughly enjoy every time I use it - it's a real boon on such a long flight to be able to shower at the time you want to help adjust your body clock for your arrival. I'm not a fan of the First Class lounge in the A380 terminal at DXB it feels completely soulless and the shower was only lukewarm - the second time I've experienced this. The massage in the spa was good though. Return AKL-LGW was almost as good as the outbound. However the menu was limited and repetitive - lamb and chicken biryani on all sectors. Although there was also a pasta dish this was not really the level of variety and quality I expect when flying in First for more than 24 hours. Thankfully a bit of creative thinking with the starters (including the excellent mezze and generous portions of caviar) meant I was certainly not going to be left hungry. Simple things like freshly-prepared toast are also very welcome though I wish they would introduce ice cream. One slight niggle is that I asked for a large bottle of water when I boarded and was told there only 6 for the entire flight so I couldn't have one moments later another member of cabin crew came up and offered one oblivious to what I'd previously been told. Overall though cabin crew were even better on the return leg especially between Brisbane and Dubai. Boarding for the final sector B777 DXB to LGW was a farce and the one real let-down of the trip. I was called from the lounge at 0710 for an 0800 flight then had to wait for thirty minutes in two different holding areas until they could bring a special bus for the first class pax (frankly I'd rather have just got on a normal bus and been able to relax on the aircraft) which then took more than 15 minutes to crawl around the airfield. All in all though Emirates First continues to be by far my preferred carrier to New Zealand for its mix of quality service and cost.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-10;DUS-SIN-DUS. Again full score for Emirates! It's simply the best. Perfect friendly and attentive crew very good meals no delays wonderful inflight entertainment. Recommend to use also the free Chauffeur service to make it even more convenient.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-08;Been travelling Emirates for a year and on 3 occasions (all from London to Kuala Lumpur). Overall experiences have been good except for our recent flight last week. As before we booked our seats online but one of the seat was changed without our knowledge leading us having to re-booked/changed both our seats to one which we are unhappy with. Check in staff on the day was unhelpful. We will be flying again early June to Kuala Lumpur but will give Emirates a miss on this occasion as the protest. We will consider Emirates again next year.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-07;ATH-DXB-ATH. Arriving at check-in flight was overbooked in economy. They offered me an upgrade to business at 300 euros per sector. During booking business class price was 1300 euros so I stayed with J. An A345 the seat was comfortable and pitch just ok. Catering ok but really nothing special. Crew very attentive IFE the typical ICE on EK which is not my taste. Variety of movies limited. Flight arrived on time. Return a different story. Again overbooked flight and the same offer. Still on J class on a 777-300. Boarding and a bus ride that literally took 37 minutes. Nice tour of the airport! Flight departed with 30 minutes delay due to the bus ride as we got into the plane 5 minutes before the STD. Same thing on catering and seat. This time crew was a bit uninterested and robotic. Arriving in ATH and we have to wait for our bags more than 25 minutes. All in all an average experience. Next time and my schedule permits I will try Etihad or Qatar as their ticket price is a bit lower and inflight service seems to be better than EK.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-05;Emirates had become my airline of choice because of the great seats and entertainment system on their new A380's. Until my most recent flights I also found their service and food to be among the best. However on my recent flights from HKG to DXB and DXB to Dublin I found both the food and service to be awful. Their switch to serving food in J class on open plates is a disaster. The food ends up lukewarm and dry. I much preferred the sealed container. The food was bland and tasteless. The cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. On the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. I might just look for other options next time I fly. One thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it - the HKG-DXB route flies over Bay of Bengal. Turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. Also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached DXB. The ground journey took 20 minutes. The place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between T1 and T3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. A frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-05;EK 413 AKL-SYD 13 April Business Class. Disappointing service and poor hospitality. Emirates appear to have lost their former sparkle. Problems started at the Emirates Lounge in AKL where numerous Qantas passengers were denied entry due to different rules applying to status levels and guests. Emirates staff looked particularly anguished dealing with the number of complaints they had on this occasion. The Lounge was full to capacity and it was difficult to find a seat with flights going via Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne all around the same time. However the food in the lounge is exceptionally good compared to competitor offerings at the moment. Onboard the business class standard on the A380 was poor in hospitality comparison to current competitors. Young inexperienced staff surprisingly lacking basic etiquette and manners. Staff looked tired and despondent. During the flight I was either served twice or not at all. Despite the new A380 I was surrounded with broken and depreciated equipment. Meal service very average. The staff just seemed to want to rush and close down the service as quickly as possible. The pricing is definitely competitive and if hospitality isn't important and you just want to nod off this could still be a good way to travel. For me the quality is just not good enough in hospitality for business class. Its not just about the IFE and the swish seating capsule. The outbound flight with Air New Zealand may have lacked the latest technology and wizardry in cabin design but made up for it in spades in terms of hospitality professionalism and overall comfort. Have used Emirates a couple of times over the last few years and couldn't fault them previously. Will avoid them for a while. Clearly lost something as I didn't feel looked after on this occasion.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-05;Birmingham-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney-Christchurch NZ 19 January 2014. Economy. Nice food and good service. Birmingham - Dubai was a 777 (2 class) and we had bassinet bulkhead seats row 8 which gave lots of legroom. Dubai - Bangkok was the A380 which is super comfortable we had bulkhead behind seats next to the midships galley. There was some noise from the galley and there is a locker above the seats which is not great but we were comfortable enough. Bangkok - Sydney was with Qantas this was the least comfortable as plane was older. Although Emirates is Qantas partner you cannot pre-assign seats for Qantas flights so these were our least good seats. Sydney to Christchurch was again a 777 and not full so I again sat in row 8. I believe that Emirates does not make the (777 2 class) row 8 bassinet seats available until airport check in. If there are no babies needing them you can ask at the gate to move into these seats and if you are a frequent flyer you may get moved It worked for us.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-05;EK 418 - QF 8418 - Bangkok - Sydney. Seats - 17A 17B 17D 17E 17F + Bassinet for baby. 24/04/2014. When I saw I was Emirates coming back from Bangkok I was very happy as I had heard great things about them. In the end it was a disaster. Couldn't check in all the way through with my family at Phuket so had to wait until a desk opened in Bangkok then best part of 45 mins. Once on the aircraft we had been split up so cabin crew tried to sort this out but a very large person who had booked the seat insisted having it. It was sorted in the end but took a long time. As for the seats they where like rocks to sit on for any time. I was amazed that the cabins have large screen that keep coming on and off telling us here we are. One was directly over my 5 month old Granddaughter and every time it came on it woke her up. Even with the eye shades provided for passengers the bright light came through making it impossible to rest or sleep. Over all very disappointed.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-05-04;"On a recent flight on 22 April from Warsaw to Guangzhou via Dubai (EK180) I was upgraded to Business Class. Finally I get to sample the much advertised Emirates Business Class. The Business Class was full and so was the entire flight I assume. The welcome was the usual that you get with the welcome drink but none of the staff offered to take my jacket. After take off the bar service started quite late. There was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. The second round of drinks took ages. I had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. I had to remind to which I was given a curt unapologetic ""it's being made""! That too by the chief purser a lady in her 50's. During the meal which was nice the wine came only once. I had to remind the stewardess to fill-up my long empty glass. The staff was not well-informed about the plane either. I asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. She never bothered to find-out and inform either. I can say one thing about Emirates. The hardware is there but the 'software' still needs to be updated. Staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. I would not recommend anyone to buy the Business Class unless it's only for the additional comfort. Service is definitely lacking. Wonder what the First Class is like. Taking into account my experience in the Business Class I am certain the pampering is non-existent. Frankly I prefer Lufthansa. The service in all classes is very good and that keeps you aching for more.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-04;Flew from Zurich to Tokyo via Dubai. The flight was efficiently handled. B777 on the way out was fine though the seating was not better than normal. A380 from DXB to ZRH had noticeably more seat space and was remarkably quiet. Meals were exceptionally good but service was patchy. Not everyone got coffee maybe the team needs to bring in some f/b to improve there.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-03;Flight EK050/EK705 in Economy Flight EK706/EK051 in Business. Used special EK offer for business class. From MUC to DXB and back A380: comfortable seats with enough leg room even in Economy! DXB to SEZ a very different story: A340-500 with really cramped seating in Economy seats in Business on SEZ to DXB are not lie-flat and not comfortable. Food ok on 3 legs but worse (with old bread) in Business on SEZ-DXB leg. However can not understand the policy of EK to serve breakfast on a night flight at 3am on DXB-SEZ leg in Economy whereas the C-Cl and First Class Pax could sleep. Crew in general were polite but seemed very unorganised with bad service in Business Class on SEZ-DXB leg: they just served coffee and tea after breakfast with no refills and no additional drink rounds or offers. Personally addressed in C only on the DXB-MUC leg but also forgot after dinner to serve coffee or tea and the chocolate to me and my wife. In MUC they had troubles fixing the airbridge at the upper deck which resulted in late disembarking of all C and F-Class pax so at the passport control all Y-Pax (almost 300-400) were in front while the priority baggage was already on the bag carousel. IFE as already mentioned before: wonderful but not working properly on DXB-SEZ leg.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-05-01;Flew LGW to SYD via DXB then Perth to LGW. All four flights were on time and pain free. Able to book seats on all flights well in advance and choose rear doubles on 777-300s which gave additional space albeit with crew reserved seats behind. Caught up on most of the films I had wanted to see for the past 6 months and a few more beside. Very good quality meals with real metal cutlery provided. Rest rooms were kept clean by flight crew who were always available to offer service - although not too difficult when they are only just behind you! Love to get the chance to fly Emirates again. Wish they flew direct to USA from London!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-30;First problem on EK018 only 1 USB port worked between 3 seats. When I placed the food tray down there was remnants of the last meal and coffee stains all over it. EK805 delayed approx. 2.5 hours combined with delay in immigration caused me to miss my connecting flight in Jeddah resulting in a 9 hour wait for a place on connecting flight. I arrived at my destination in Medinah 12 hours after I was supposed to. EK802 delayed 1.5 hrs from Jeddah. I ordered Asian veg meal but was served an omelette with sausage. EK017 delayed 15-20 mins causing me to miss my train which I had booked before travelling. The food on the outward journey was very bland but on the flight to Manchester was wonderful. The only consolation is I was travelling alone and not with my family.;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-04-30;LHR-DXB-LHR in Y on A380 - for leg room and width still the best in economy on this plane - I'm 6'3 no problems on a 7 hrs flight. IFE excellent as always. Food - EK have changed there attractive economy meal tray set ups to all half size trays and very standard shape dishes - food still good but no room to move things round and very charter carrier style - shame! Although £391 return to DXB cant complain at all.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-30;MAN-DXB-HKT in business. Excellent in every aspect. Picked up at home by driver lounge facility at Manchester were most impressive. Comfort levels on 777 were very high and better than on the A380. EK will be my airline of choice in the future. The whole experience was of the highest standard but spoiled by the lamentable security staff at Manchester. This was beyond the control of Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-28;MUC-DXB-JNB - Very good experience. Great A380 and Boeing 777 clean bright and colourful inside good seats. Wonderful entertainment on flights. Great food and drinks. For veggie very good meals (asiatic and lacto-ovo). Nice the idea of the menu printed for each passenger and the stickers to put on seat to remind staff to wake you up if fallen asleep during meals time! A sweet fragrance applied to the cabin before departure pleasant! The service quick and complete. Crew members very helpful smiles in each circumstance and well-instructed. Toilets often cleaned up. We had a great sleep with the little lights on the top of the cabin and awoke with soft orange pink lights in the early morning.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-28;Fortunate enough to fly EK without going to Dubai flew MEL-AKL-MEL aircraft on both ways were the A380-800 very good experience on both ways both on time. Food was fine FA's are very attentive the ICE entertainment was top class. Would fly them again in the future and would highly recommend them at least on this sector.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-27;EK503 Bombay to Dubai newest 777ER300. Left around 15 minutes late but arrived on time. The newest 777ER300 had the ultra-modern ICE (Information Communication Entertainment) System with touch-enabled extra-wide screens. Remotes were looking like Ipads. State-of-the art InFlight Entertainment system. The aircraft was new and looked very clean. Everything was in perfect order. There were star like mini-lights on the passenger walkway ceiling which gave a calm effect. Ground crew were very helpful and answered all queries. The Cabin Crew were extremely helpful friendly and responded to all requests very quickly. Unlike other airlines Emirates has very comfortable seats with plenty of leg space in Economy. The Business and First class portrayed infinite luxury never seen before in any other airline. The food was very appetizing. The food is selected according to the flight route which means that the food is selected according to the cuisine of the departure and arrival cities. I had the Chicken Biryani and it was the tastiest Chicken Biryani I have had so far!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-27;DXB to JFK On A380 Business Class. Special check in counters for business class and the lounge had nice food choices. Spectacular service inflight with excellent food choice and wines. FA very attentive and very comfortable seat the best airline so far.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-27;EK20 MAN-DXB overnight on 25-26 April (B777-300ER) connecting with EK863 DXB-MCT on 26 April (A330-200). The chauffeur service arrived promptly at my home and as always was immaculately turned out. Our drive to Manchester was made tedious by heavy Friday traffic but the driver handled everything calmly and with good humour. At the terminal I was checked in swiftly and 20 minutes later was in the Emirates lounge (this included time spent picking up some last-minute purchases). Boarding was on time and the flight left slightly early. After watching a film and enjoying supper I got 4 hours solid sleep waking up about 50 minutes out of Dubai. We landed a few minutes early and it took only 20 minutes including the security check to get to the gate for my connecting flight despite this leaving from Concourse C and the arrival having parked right at the end of Concourse B. The flight to Muscat had particularly personable cabin crew. we were on time and for a change I even had a light breakfast on this 40-minute hop rather than falling asleep! In all a perfect trip: no fuss no worries. I make this journey every 5 weeks and this was the kind of faultless seamless performance that sets Emirates apart and makes my regular 'commute' to Muscat much more than merely tolerable.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-25;I flew KHI-DXB-JNB and return same route. This time I flew London Gatwick-DXB-ISB. The aircraft's were new and tidy. But the toilet had a broken handwash and it was not that clean. I was not provided with headphones and had to ask for them. Staff were not attentive and seemed in a rush. Secondly I asked for water the cabin crew came after such a very long time. The food was good but the service was not enough good.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-24;EK404 Dubai to Singapore 777ER300 14 April 2014. Left around 30 minutes late but arrived on time into Singapore. Cabin crew excellent meal was excellent with the crew constantly wandering around the plane handing out drinks and snacks. In flight entertainment was excellent. The trip was just on 8 hours long during the day but thanks to the service and IFE the time flew by.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-24;NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-24;EK355 Singapore to Dubai A380 10 April 2014. We had aisle seats the service was excellent with an excellent meal. Inflight entertainment was extremely good with a vast selection to choose from during the 8 hour flight. Flight left a little late but arrived on time into Dubai at 0.55. Cabin crew very attentive and provided great service to those of us in cattle class throughout the flight.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-23;BHX-DXB-KUL. Probably the worst long haul flights I have had. Emirates seems to have deteriorated considerably since my last trip in 2010. Outbound flight was spoilt by passengers who wandering about the cabin visiting friends/relatives at all hours of the night and were not controlled by the cabin crew even when seat belt signs were lit. Although things were better on the return legs staff seemed generally disinterested and demoralised. Food service was very slow (over an hour to serve breakfast). Drinks were served after the meal rather than before. Altogether a very disappointing experience.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-23;24 Jan 2014 EK412 Dubai - Sydney. I am well travelled and have experienced many airlines but this was the worst in terms of staff inexperience and rudeness. The service was appalling with a young rude and inexperienced cabin crew. I had to ask to have my food tray removed on two occasions. I had to ask for coffee and when it arrived without apology it was cold. There was no help with overhead storage. They need to take notice of customer complaints.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-22;"Flew EK 74 EK382 business class April 6. Cabin staff good although noticed difference of service between the 2 flights in term of welcome I am a skywards member and the ""welcome back"" when you board not always there. Toiletries pouch given on one sector not on the other why? Where EK fails miserably is on ground staff sometimes rude and not really concerned with passengers experience and well being Late departure from CDG (accepted) which meant missing connection in DXB although promised that we would make (unacceptable) and late departure from DXB (unexplained) which meant missing connection in HKG and refused access to Lounge for 12 hours wait.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-22;I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 8 years and up to 2 years ago I had no real problems and planes were never delayed more than 5 or 10 mins. However in the last 2 years I have increasingly experienced delays which coupled with the ludicrous different terminal and concourse situation at Dubai has led to problems in transfers at DXB. My last two trips LGW-DXB-Bkk involved 4 sector flights each and in those trips only one flight was on time. Last night I flew DXB to LGW on a A380 (500 passengers) arriving at the boarding gate 45 mins before departure I saw that boarding had started and majority of economy passengers had boarded. I was told there was a delay so better to wait in the business lounge. Only one announcement was made. No further announcements or information given. 70 mins later a large Indian tour party (40 persons) arrived at the gate and immediately a final call for boarding was issued and the flight took off. Clearly the flight of 500 persons was delayed to satisfy the tour party. Talking to fellow passengers at DXB on the plane and at LGW it seems the reliability is slipping. The service on board is hit and miss and in fact last night's service DXB-LGW and the LGW ground support was the worst I have experienced.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-21;I'm a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. When visiting friends I wanted to experience a flight on an Airbus 380 in Business. Big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. In my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. Significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. Food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. By the time they arrive the meal is finished. I would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. I usually try to fly via Doha with Qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-21;SYD-DXB-CDG and CMN-DXB. Seating is tight particularly on the 777 compared to the A380 (don't like the 10 abreast idea). Cabin staff look good and do everything expected of them but do seem a little cold and lack warmth. Was disappointed that both DXB arrivals were at remote gates which makes the arrival experience tedious. Used the Dubai Connect hotel/transfer service from Casablanca (connecting onto Qantas at DXB) which is a godsend. Was impressed how efficiently it all worked. DXB airport is huge but works reasonably well. Enjoyed using the Business Lounge possible because of my Qantas Club membership. IFE is excellent.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-21;I flew from Copenhagen to Dubai in January 2014 on the brand new 777-ER. The seats were comfortable and the service was excellent. For the entertainment you didn't need to use the corded control they supplied you with a tablet to control your entertainment. If you didn't like the screen or you wanted to play games the tablet was a great option. I had some problems with the people in front of me. It was a family of 3 the child tossed crisps onto me and the parents couldn't care less. Staff said nothing to the parents.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-21;HKG-DXB-MXP (Malpensa Milan) in Business Class - my first experience with Emirates and an excellent experience overall. Superb service food and wine. As a Qantas Platinum I was able to use the Emirates First Class Lounge while in transit through Dubai and was served a delicious lunch and fine wine with impeccable service. In regards to the flights themselves I cannot think of a single negative comment to make.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-19;Flew from LAX to Dubai on 3/25/14 and back on 4/15/14. The service level was poor! The food was lousy and the bathrooms were dirty and out of stock! There were trash on the cabin floor and none of the attendants bothered to pick it up! The food trays stayed in front of passengers for at least 40 minutes before they were picked up. The internet connection was very poor and I kept being disconnected every few seconds! When passengers myself included used the button to call an attendant no one paid any attention! Mine was on for 30 minutes before an attendant turned it off while he was passing by and didn't even bother to ask me why I turned it on!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-16;I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 6 or 7 years and it seems the reliability is slipping. LGW-BKK-LGW - all flights were late (up to 1.5 hours) except the DXB-LGW leg. 2.5 hour connections in DXB are now becoming very tight and stressful due to lateness of flights and the inordinate amount of bussing in DXB. Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable. On the plus side the in flight entertainment is good the prices are competitive and frequent fliers are frequently upgraded. The bad news is that Emirates seem to be expanding faster than DXB is so I don't see the transit experience getting any better any time soon.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-16;EK231 April 14 2014. Overall experience: unsatisfactory rude flight attendants. My first time flying economy class with Emirates and I will never use them again. Flight attendants were rude when serving meals. My wife was asked what kind of food she would like and she said chicken. In a rude tone the flight attendant said they were out of chicken and only had vegetarian while throwing the meal to my wife. When serving the second meals (breakfast) the same thing happened. Finally she came back with the food of our choice.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-14;EK242 Toronto to Dubai 4/9/2014. EK524 Dubai to Hyderabad India 4/10/2014. It was a great experience this was my first time with this airline. Excellent customer service crew members were very helpful. The complimentary food was excellent.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-14;April 6 to April 11. Flight 206 from New York and 205 from Milan Italy. I was very surprised to learn upon check in that the carry on requirements for economy consists of one bag that has to weigh no more than 7 kilos. In my entire life I have never had my carry on bag weighed so this was surprising. Many carry on bags can weigh up to 8 lbs for just the bag depending on the construction so 7 kilos is unreasonable to an extreme. Otherwise the flight was more enjoyable than most but given this unreasonable weight requirement I cannot fly Emirates again unfortunately. My carryon was weighed which put me into a position to have to decide if I should check an expensive camera and laptop and how to do that for which there really was no solution. A supervisor eventually came over took one fast look at the contents of my carry on without me saying anything and said it's fine but there was a good 10 minutes of discussing what to do before that.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-13;Flew on 31/10/2013 from Dubai to New Delhi. It was a pleasant flight and luckily got upgraded to Business class at the boarding counter. Nice and pleasant cabin crew and a nice spacious seat. The food was good but the service during the meals was satisfactory. We were introduced to a variety of snacks throughout the flight. The In-Flight system was excellent and it was easy to pass the 3 hours.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-10;April 9 2014. This is my second trip from Dubai to Toronto both trips had the same problems: Delay at Dubai airport. Rude staff. Food was bad. It was not worth the money. It's a direct flight but too many headaches involved. Unfortunately unpleasant experience.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-10;My second time with Emirates I flew from GVA-DXB-CGK vv. All the flights were better than I expected/experienced. I have flown with Emirates in 2011 and these flight were much better. Flight attendants were attentive (especially my flight from CGK to DXB) food was nice as expected nothing to complain about with the seat and best entertainment system ICE. All flights were on time. Cabin onboard clean and nice mood lighting system with star lights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-10;Flew 27/01/14 from Glasgow to Dubai for the first time in business class and couldn't fault it! I was mesmerised with the room for a start and the service couldn't have been better. Although a bit slow on boarding the plane but didn't realise that all passengers enter via business class? Doesn't make sense to me!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;Overall service: unsatisfactory. Flight 232 on 3/1/14 from Washington DC to Dubai. Plane was dirty and flight attendants were rude. These people needs to be retrain as far as providing good customer service to their passengers. Example: It took almost 2 hours to clear the trays after we ate. Upon arriving in Dubai we had to walk from one end of the concourse to the other end to catch our connecting flight from Dubai to the Philippines. Upon reaching the gate we were told we had to go back to where we came from to catch the same flight. After another hour or so of waiting we were told to go to another place to catch the plane this was when we were put in a shuttle and driven to where the plane was. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants of what was going on and instead of listening she started arguing with me. This was my first time flying with this airlines and will be my last.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;EK5102 1/4/14 seat 34b return 5/4/14 on 43a. I have had the pleasure of flying LHR-DXB-LHR on their A380 airbus which is truly king of the skies! Their economy seat 42A is superb. The seat and their ICE entertainment is first class! The level of service is second to none. I have flown Virgin many times Emirates is in a league of their own! I would thoroughly recommend them as they were fantastic!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;We travelled from Perth to Manchester via Dubai. Perth to Dubai was ok. Dubai to Manchester was a disgrace. There were 3 choices of food on the menu beef chicken curry or a seafood dish. Our choice was beef we were told there was none left. I don't eat curry and seafood is a definitely no no on a flight. I was offered a vegetarian option which was inedible. 2 hours into the flight which was 5pm all the lights went out and the blinds came down.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;We flew from Dubai (DXB) to Moscow (DME) on April 6th economy class while our flight had been scheduled on April 5th. airline changed aircraft Airbus-380 to Boing-777 3 hours before departure without any notification. Airport check-in machine was returning error during our attempts no information at check-in desks. Not all passengers could get their seats because of B777 smaller capacity. However airline provided hotel meal and extra round-trip ticket. Flight was on-time. Flight was not very good they ran out of food choices and food quality was awful. Overall service become worse.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;The measure of an airline is how they behave when things are not going right. My experience of this airline is that they tell lies and are a disorganized rabble. They were 2 hours late out of Sydney which they blamed on the late arrival of the plane however as the flight was leaving at 6.00 am and there is a curfew in Sydney this was not true. We were told on check in that they would make up time in the air which they did not. We were told they would make the connecting flights wait in Dubai which they did not. The ground staff at Dubai were unprepared and uninformed as to what was planned for us. I will not use this airline again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-06;Flew from JFK to Dubai in March 2014 with final destination Lahore Pakistan. Liked the new A380 but economy seats are not comfortable as compared to 777. The worst part is window seats are useless because A380 double window distance is too wide to enjoy looking outside. The meal service was terrible both ways. Only 3 distinct ethnic foods in menu and usually then ran out off some of them (usually what I liked). I complained and was told that its very difficult to serve 400+ economy passengers and take care all of their food types. I was dismayed by the answer. Their 777 from Dubai to Lahore was old. I usually fly using PIA which is a direct flight from JFK to Lahore. Unless I want to see Dubai or this route is short I will never use Emirates to go to Pakistan. Don't see any major difference. PIA is not bad at all when you actually compare with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-03;Manchester to Perth business class. Experience from Manchester to Dubai was very disappointing. Boarding was chaotic and very disorganised the service from the young male attendants very poor. They had run out of my food choice and the business section was almost empty. The food I was given the seafood stew was inedible. The TV did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. All in all a bad experience. Considering the cost of the flight I have travelled with Emirates in economy and the service was better. Flight from Dubai to Perth was better the attendants were excellent - what a difference that made.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-04-02;Washington Dulles (IAD) direct to Dubai. I have no complaints at all for this flight. My complaint comes from my return. Was at the airport (Dubai) 3 hours early. No problem going through security. I will just skip to the problem. Poor communication. We were delayed 7 hours yes 7 hours and no one to tell us anything. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we were told the plane was being taken out of service. Sat at the gate for another 3 hours and still no word. We finally heard from passengers that had been inquiring that we needed to be at gate B32 from B18 and the plane will depart in an hour. Really. No one from the airlines said a word. Once we got on board there weren't any problems. Communication is key.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-01;We flew from Heathrow to Dubai on an Airbus 380 early in December 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and I was told that I could not get the chicken that I had asked for. The flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. When we few back in March 2014 exactly the same thing happened - sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. Also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours I eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. Emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the Airbus. We flew from Dubai to Johannesburg and back on a 777 and I cannot fault the service on these planes.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-04-01;Flew BNE-DXR-LHR and return on A380 all legs. I had great crew on every single leg who were friendly and attended to our wants at all times. In between meal services we were constantly supplied with water/juice. All legs bar one departed on or close to time (dep LHR one hour late but arrived pretty much on time to DXB). My only complaint would be the lack of leg room in economy class and the bottom part of the seat was a bit too soft. Seat width was fine and meals were just above the average for economy class Would recommend Emirates economy for a competitive price and decent service as long as you remember if you want top shelf seats and service to fly business or first! Wifi service is non existent/very hard to connect to in DXB which isn't an emirates thing but does reflect on them as it's their home airport.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-31;"Good flights WAW-DXB-NRT. WAW-NRT not so full with amazing staff DXB-BRT full but ok (good ICE great food). Inflight Entertainment on WAW-DXB is not so good as this is old A330 plane. But this sector is not so long. FAs were attentive to ""call"" button and soft drinks were served repetitively between main meals (and it was not problem to get a beer if you ask and wait a minute).";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-31;Travelled business class from Sydney to Lyon - a long flight. All was very good A380 very comfortable seats and plenty of room. No delays. Food was OK have had better on another airline. Main issue is that I had to wait about 20 minutes for a toilet as the staff were changing in there!! Not good enough when you are paying extra for business class! Otherwise the flight was excellent.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-31;MAN-AKL (via DXB and SYD) and return. A388 used on all sectors. Fantastic planes - very quiet in comparison to 747s and 777s. The ICE in-flight entertainment system was second to none so much choice and easy to use. The staff were uniformly friendly and would go out of their way to help. For some reason our pre-booked seats were changed at the gate. When we boarded we complained to a member of cabin staff and they made sure we were seated in the seats we had booked on-line. I slept really well on my flights and the seat pitch was good (I am 6 ft). Will definitely fly long haul with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-30;Flew on EK 108 from Larnaca to Dubai on their brand new 777-300er. Overall clean plane crew very attentive and appeared as soon as call buttons were pressed. Inflight entertainment worked without a glitch and the food was delicious. Keep it up Emirates!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;TPE-DBX-NCL Business Class. Second time to fly business class on Emirates after many years flying mostly economy. Service was outstanding from chauffeur pick-up through check-in and most importantly onboard everything went smoothly and everyone was extremely professional and helpful. Drinks and food were plentiful and well presented and when I was unable to get one preferred meal option the cabin crew were very apologetic even expressing their apologies again as I disembarked. It was hardly their fault but I appreciated that they felt it could be important to a passenger. Seats were amazing and i recommend the mattress to add that little extra comfort throughout the flight. ICE was great but on first leg the B777 felt slightly older and the control panel less responsive than on the DBX-NCL leg. Cabin crew couldn't have been more helpful and polite. I've flown economy 15+ times with Emirates and have never had any complaints about their quality or service but it was worth paying the extra to be in business class for two long flights and be pampered. DBX business lounge in Terminal 3 is a little too basic but I won't complain about the snacks or drinks available. Logged on to complimentary wifi easily. I'm looking forward to my return trip.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;SYD-DXB on A380. More room than on the 777 but very disappointed with this leg. Cabin was freezing even with two blankets. Sat in seat 51D which was last row in front of galley. VERY noisy and every 20 seconds or so there was a loud gushing noise like an Arctic wind which sent the temperature even lower. Sound on my IFE was very unreliable and despite a promise to reboot it it never happened. Food was tepid and bland. Overall not very good.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;BKK - Hong Kong on A380 in business class. The BKK EK lounge is being refurbished and I was asked to use Qantas lounge. The Emirates rep in that lounge was superbly helpful and pleasant. Onboard my seat area was clean and everything worked. I did not find the seat too comfortable and used the mattress. After take off the on-board bar opened. The bar person could not speak English well was disorganized and had no idea how to mix drinks. There was a nice selection of tasty sandwiches wraps etc. I asked for the warm food printed on the bar menu and was told 'we will put it out if we have time'. After challenging this they reluctantly heated some for me. I was then told to go back to my seat as lunch will be served. I sat with a table cloth in front of me for a further 20 mins and then a tray of food arrived. The steak in balsamic vinegar and creamy potato was good and tasty. There was a crew member walking up and down serving wines which was positive too. The toilets were not well stocked with tooth brushes etc but were clean. I found the crew awful - with fake smiles patronizing and they ran around like disorganized headless chickens tripping over each other and created a very anxious atmosphere in the cabin. They treated the passengers with contempt and I felt that I was an inconvenience to them.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;We travelled on the A380 from LHR to Dubai. Upon entering the plane first impressions was wonderful the inflight entertainment was great. Though that is the only good thing about this airline the cabin crew is the worst. The crew are awful they don't care about service at all we waited over 3 hours after we pressed the call button for a stewardess to come. The food is awful nothing but a horrible chicken curry on the menu on both legs of the journey. The final meal served will probably be a biscuit and a cup of tea. I had high hopes for this airline but they are really awful Dubai is a wonderful place to visit but don't fly with this airline.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;DXB-MCR. Having landed from Sydney I upgraded to Business using Skywards miles. Well worth it. Lounges at DXB are massive and though functional have lost the intimate atmosphere that once existed. Food in lounge was fairly predictable too. Flight delayed in DXB 1 hour due to passengers being off loaded but was onboard so managed to relax and watch a movie. Flight was good and service fine. Food much improved for Economy though the snacks in the lounge at rear of plane were a little stale. Chauffeur Drive from MCR worked well. Not cheap but if you have miles to spend an upgrade is well worth it.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-28;MCR-DXB-SYD. Flight's ok though service a little lacking in parts. On time and meals fair. Overall not bad but not outstanding.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-27;DXB-CMBEK 650 First Class Suites B777-300ER. The First Class Lounge in Terminal 3 (B Gates) was good and the menu service meals were excellent. Boarding was not well organized. Inflight service was excellent but not outstanding given that First Class was not full. Each suite is very comfortable and well laid-out though the decor is amazingly garish. No privacy when the sliding doors are open unlike some First Class suite designs of their competitors. No amenity kit as it was a four-hour night flight. Was promised socks toothpaste/brush and eye shades but never received any. Toothpaste/brush shaving cream/razor and combs were available in the well- maintained toilets for self service. Meals were very poor for First Class though well presented. I ordered the Sri Lankan meal (Chicken Koththu Roti) but it was hotter than anything I've been served in Colombo and was truly tasteless. I sent it back and ordered an omelette that was the exact opposite (too bland) and had a machine made look about it. One expects much better in First Class especially as I recall the amazingly delicious food Emirates served in First Class ten years ago on a LHR-DXB flight served from a trolley rather than on trays like now and a more recent meal in First Class served by EK last year on a CMB-DXB flight. I know everyone is looking at cost-cutting measures but this is supposedly First Class. The flight departed DXB and arrived in CMB on time. Baggage delivery in CMB was prompt and baggage transfer from BA at DXB was very well handled by EK. For a four hour flight EK Business Class which I typically use on this route seems a better value.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;EK 409 on 16 March. Left on a 3.20am flight that I would not really recommend given the time. Travelling business I at least thought the staff would promptly go around the cabin and get any services out the way ASAP. I wanted a nightcap to help me sleep and it took an amazing 1.5 hours before I got it. I have travelled Emirates before and they have been good but a little more attention to customers paying for service regardless of time would not go astray. The one saving grace was inflight entertainment.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;EK371 Bangkok to Dubai on 23rd Mar. Flew Emirates on the late night flight at 1.55am. Crew were fantastic and meals and drinks were plentiful and served with a smile. Aircraft not too new but clean and ICE was very enjoyable.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;EK 027 DXB to GLA on 23rd Mar. Aircrew were outstanding and very professional. Meals were tasty and enjoyable. Aircraft was new with excellent ICE range of all the latest movies. Aircrew were very friendly and worked well serving refreshments during the whole flight with a good caring smiling attitude and did a fantastic job.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;Manchester - Dubai -–Phuket -–Dubai - Manchester. Flew on the A380 on the Manchester legs and the 777 on the Phuket leg. Both experiences top class crews on all sectors excellent. Food and beverages first class. A fantastic experience that I hope to do again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;Caught EK408 from KL back to Melbourne on 21 March. From the lounge to the arrival the staff were fantastic. The inflight entertainment along with the meal starved should make Qantas wake up. Both beat Qantas and was served with staff who smiled and were a pleasure. Looking forward to my next flight in a week or so!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-24;DUS-DXB-CGK (Dusseldorf - Jakarta) on 08/09 March and return 21 March. All flights 777 300ER. Air fares a fraction of what Lufthansa offered. Very satisfied with flights on time and service prior to take off and at the airports. Service during flight overall OK but staff could be more attentive. Seats a bit old partly broken. Met a friend in Economy and found out the main dish was exactly the same food I ordered in Business! Was not hungry when lunch was served and 2 hours later there was nothing left over except for desserts was disappointed.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-22;EK002 March 16th LHR-DXB. The staff are extremely casual and non-professional. They lack the basic courtesy on how to serve premium passengers. As we entered the business class cabin en-route from London-Dubai two of the flight attendants were chatting away near our seat about social media and twitter etc! They didn't seem to notice at all that passengers had already boarded. Though the staff were not rude they were extremely casual in service.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-22;SYD-BKK-DXB then to LHR. SYD-BKK leg was late by about an hour. This was EK 419 on 7/3/2014. Lay flat bed was hard and not actually lie flat. Food was less than average and certainly of a lesser quality than economy flight outbound. Wine served warm no offer of pudding or cheese after main course. Very little soft drinks offered and the cabin crew were less than helpful. BKK-DXB: Breakfast served cold asked for the Deli platter but told it was not available. Flight service mediocre - no soft drinks offered. Seat uncomfortable and not lie flat. New cabin crew no better than on SYD-BKK leg. DXB-LHR. As flight was late into DXB was held at arrival gate and then asked to run to next gate - no chance! New A380 to LHR and such a difference to the 777 on the other legs. Great service good food far better seat good food and great cabin crew. Next trip I will go back to Cathay business class which is far better even on a 777.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-22;Heathrow to Christchurch on a 777 but was disappointed that the seats which were classed as going flat in fact went to only approx a 30 degree angle with the feet slopping down. I didn't find out until the end of the journey that I could have asked for a mattress. This was disappointing as I have been on a 777 with another company to NZ where the seats went completely flat with feet resting on the day time footrest so there was no problem with sliding down. The configuration of seats with them was also better with individual seats so no stepping over other passengers legs. Apart from that the service was very good and as someone who needs wheelchair assistance I was treated with consideration. I also needed dietary requirements and the food was very good and well presented.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-21;Flew GVA-DXB on 17/3 DXB-DOH-DXB on 18/3 DXB-GVA on 20/3. Excellent trip with perfect service and excellent value for money Staff as usual very professional and the IFE definitely on top of what I've experienced so far. Catering was also excellent and I was served a complete meal even on a 45 min flight between DXB and DOH.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-21;MAN-DXB-SGN - left MAN 1 hour late. The Etihad flight was due to depart at the same time started boarding much earlier and left early Emirates always start boarding too late. Poor service onboard with very limited drinks offered fortunately I had bottled water with me. Boarded plane at DXB in plenty of time but departed 1 hour late informed by pilot this was because of the delay in getting peoples baggage through the airport and onto the plane as basically the airport could not cope with the amount of passengers/flights. Arrived in SGN but only one bag did the other never made the flight along with 20 other passengers bags took 2 days to get the other bag.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-19;EK230 2/26 SEA-DXB. EK775 3/3 DXB-DUR. EK776 3/14 DUR-DXB. EK229 3/16 DXB-SEA. First time flying Emirates. Found staff to be very attentive to our every need. On the first meal service our first choice of meal was not available they made a note and when they came back through with the second meal service they ensured that we got to tell them our choice before they went through the rest of the cabin. The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on. Food was excellent with great choices. Inflight entertainment is really the best I have experienced especially the aircraft that had the latest version of the ICE system loaded. There was no shortage of excellent entertainment to help pass the long hours on the flight.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-19;KIX-LIS via Dubai. Both B777-300ER. First plane was rather old and choice of movies surprisingly limited. Seat did not go to 180º flat. Food and Japanese CA very nice. Drinks not very high standard. On time. Wi-Fi at Dubai lounge not good. Second flight a very new aircraft. Fabulous ICE. Fantastic staff. Food was just average and drinks much better. Why is EK not succeeding in having a standard of service? Arrived earlier.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-17;My wife and I recently flew JFK-DXB-BKK and I returned BKK-DXB-JFK. My wife will return next week. Going out we had a pretty good trip to Dubai although the plane left late. Waited in transit in Dubai but were delayed again. Onboard told the problem had been fixed and we would depart shortly. When we got to BKK we waited for our luggage (3 pieces) only to be told it was still in Dubai. We found out 300 passengers from JFK had the same problem. On my way back check-in at BKK was a nightmare due to the fact that over 500 people were checking in. The Airbus A380-800s are just too big to handle the necessary ground operations to support them. Flight was OK to DXB nothing special. In transit at DXB I checked on which gate I was to board at and went to wait. After an interminable wait and seeing nothing I checked the board only to find out that they had changed departure gates but posted no signs or made no announcements about this. I made a mad dash to the new gate and just made it before they closed it. I was in a three-seat row with a window seat and one other passenger in the aisle seat. Behind me was a family with 2 little kids. From the minute I sat down until the time I got off the plane the kids yelled and cried. There was no problem resolution from the stewardess although there were a number of options that she could have implemented. Ground operations are terrible and their flight crew appear to know nothing about problem resolution.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-17;From DXB to MLE on a Boeing 777 was even better than the A380 business class. Seats comfort and luxury was all on that Boeing 777 and none of that was on an A380 seat. I'm going back to Male on the 12th March 2014 and I'm going on the Boeing 777.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-17;CPH-DXB-BKK early February. Flight out of Copenhagen delayed 3 hours passengers got food coupons flight one hour quicker than scheduled - no problems in reaching connection flight. On board 777-300ER service very good food better than on most other airlines pre-dinner drinks wine and cognac served during meal. Seat comfort however average with rather hard seats and 3x4x3 arrangement making you feel crammed on a sold-out flight as this. I recently flew Turkish Airlines where 3x3x3 arrangements in more comfortable seats made journey more comfortable. However IFE excellent especially music selection. Flight attendant forgot to serve coffee but - as a compensation - offered mini-bottle of cognac at end of flight. All in all a very good experience. While in Dubai staff quick to inform us about BKK flight a marvellous 380. Again seats average but otherwise a great experience on this new silent giant.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-17;9th March from Dubai to London at 16.30. Flight EK 005/QF 8005. Cabin crew were brilliant all done with a smile and they were very busy. Would definitely travel with Emirates again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-14;In February and March 2014 we travelled from Dulles Washington DC to Dubai to New Delhi and then back. Most of the journey was on 777-ER all the departures and arrivals were on time food and drinks were tasty and entertainment was awesome. Coming from Dubai to Washington DC it was night time flight there were not enough water or drink rounds. Every year we have travelled Emirates to visit India since 2005 and will try to do it again next year.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-13;Last October my wife and I flew from London to Hong Kong return with stop-overs in Dubai. We were in economy class on their Airbus 380 and Boeing 777s. This was a great experience in every respect. The aircraft cabins were in excellent shape comfortable seats with good leg space and the entertainment system worked flawlessly with a grand selection of films and music. Meal service was exceptionally fine. Receiving hot meals included in the air fare on economy class is a scarce treat nowadays. Moreover we were offered free drinks and extra snacks on our 7 hrs. flights on each leg. The cabin crew was highly competent and friendly. We are looking forward to finding an opportunity to fly Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-12;19 Feb 2014 EK405 MEL-SIN. 23 Feb 2014 EK404 SIN-MEL. Fly frequently but this was the first experience with Emirates. The plane itself was great with good food and entertainment especially with the big screen. Ground crew service at Singapore Airport was a nightmare. System problem with seat allocation which our pre-booked seats were being occupied. Staff were being rude to customers at check in counters. Customers do not come back with this kind of service level.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-12;Manchester to Clark (Manila North) via Dubai in Economy. Chose this route as my wife's family live very close to Clark airport and it's much easier than grappling with travel from Manila. Outbound to DXB on A380 very comfortable quiet and smooth with attentive service good food and plenty of new films to watch. Similarly DXB to CRK on B777 not as quiet but still reasonably comfortable. On return we were upgraded to Business on CRK/DXB leg (B777) excellent lie-flat seats with massage function brilliant service and food. DXB/MAN same A380 service as outbound. Everything ran either to time or early paid £550 each for the whole trip. Excellent.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-11;Flew FRA-DXB and DXB-MAD back in February. Generally speaking all aspects of the service were more than satisfactory. From my experience at the ticket counter in FRA where the gentleman was very courteous to checking in online the DXB bag drop with no line and the generally polite service onboard I thought the staff did a very good job of creating an atmosphere of consideration for the passengers. The only thing I missed was that on the flight from FRA to DXB there simply were not enough water runs (although from DXB to MAD there were plenty). I had to ask for water and even then the cup size given to me was more appropriate for a shot of whisky than the generous glass of water I needed. Of course the ICE entertainment system was excellent as was the food service. Overall I would recommend Emirates but I would advise bringing a couple of bottles of water with you to prevent dehydration.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-11;EK0349 8/03/2014. Colombo to Dubai. I found the service terrible. It was 2 hours into the flight before we were served anything not even a drink of water was brought. I even rang for someone to come and it was ignored. Would not use Emirates on this sector again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-10;Kolkata to Dubai before connecting to a British Airways flight to Heathrow and an onward connection to Austin Texas. Emirates staff at Kolkata airport upgraded me to business class. The food service and entertainment system was superb and I got a good nights sleep before my onward journey to the United States. The A330 was immaculate cabin crew friendly and well groomed and the airline was punctual and efficient.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-10;Flew London Heathrow to Dubai on A380. We chose seats in row 45. Very efficient check-in and boarding. Aircraft very clean no crumbs down sides of seats or stains on tray. Informative updates from the pilot. Toilets were the best I have used on any aircraft and kept very clean throughout the whole flight. Seats actually very comfortable and space and recline very acceptable for Economy. Food excellent as was the service. All in all very impressed and will endeavour to fly with Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-10;BKK-DXB-DME Business class return. Excellent flight super service as usual too bad the flight between Bangkok and Dubai only last 5 hours. As a gold member the chief cabin comes and welcome you personally on board. Food is very good with great choices.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-06;A380 from LAX-DXB-MAA. LAX to DXB was the worst. I had an infant child of 9 months old and didn't get a bassinet. Flight attendants said the baby looked too big and the bassinet wouldn't hold him. Had to hold my baby for 15+ hrs. No water was given either when I had to give baby formula. DXB-MAA was much better as they were able to provide a bassinet which unsurprisingly handled the baby just fine.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-05;EK 372 on 27th Feb 2014. We have flown regularly with Emirates for many years and have been very happy. The way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th Feb was appalling. Despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. Instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. By the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. They were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. Essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. This was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. Frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business. Things do go wrong occasionally and most people are pretty reasonable if they know what is happening.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-05;MAD-DXB-BKK and back. Good service at airports nice and new airplanes comfortable seats (although on 777s the distance between seats is tight so you are touching your neighbor continuously no problem in my case as I was traveling with a friend). IFE was excellent I got the new huge screens on 3 of 4 flights. Food was generally good and crew provided good service. Transit through Dubai Airport was fine. The ticket price was a bargain so I am even more satisfied with Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-04;22nd Feb 2014 arrived in London Gatwick at 11am for our 1.30pm flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed by 6 hours and would not take off until 7pm. Staff at Gatwick and on the flight were unable to give us any information about our connecting flights to India. Landed in Dubai at 6am on 23rd Feb and although all passengers on the flight had missed their connections there were no ground staff waiting to direct us. Asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. We sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. Although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. At 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to Trivandrum. Although we waited 16 hours in the airport Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. Finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th Feb. We appreciate that delays due to bad weather are unavoidable. However Emirates had 24 hours notice after the fog on Saturday morning and did nothing to prepare for the chaos on Sunday. Communication was extremely poor.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-04;I have flown a few times with Emirates and I can never complain! Had a flight 2 days ago from Sydney to Dubai (14 hours) but it didn't feel that long because the staff were so good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-04;"We were stranded in Dubai for over 24 hours. I mean myself and about 60 other passengers because our connecting flight (also an Emirates flight) left without us. None of us received accommodation no lounge not even a place to take a proper shower or refresh. We didn't receive boarding passes for the next flight for 17 hours or so they kept telling us to ""come back in 2 hours"". This went on all day I couldn't even leave the airport if I wanted to! Emirates had no sense of organization and zero sympathy for passengers.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-03;First time to be disappointed by EK service. Arrived at the airport on time to find out that my flight to JED was delayed 7 hours not to mention check in staff didn't know why and why we had not been informed. Asked if I could leave DXB intl to go home and come back they said no since it was an estimated time and the plane might take off at any time. Stranded at DXB intl for 8 hours. Later on asked another member of ground crew about the update on my flight he was careless to even answer me properly. Onboard 2 female crew were shouting at passengers. Lack of communication from management to staff dealing with passengers is a major problem. On the return RUH-DXB flight on time A330-200 the oldest in EK fleet no entertainment only one meal option I was surprised that they are serving a full meal on this short 90 minutes flight. The most uncomfortable seat on a plane. Those aircraft's should be phased out immediately.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-03-03;Manchester to Christchurch via Dubai - 773ER out in Economy and had the best Economy food we have had on a plane. We are frequent flyers and this was excellent coupled with great crews and their entertainment system made a great flight. Trip back from Auckland was two A380's in Business and again we had good attentive crews and the usual level of service befitting their excellent product. Please keep up the good work re the food.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-03;We flew from Birmingham to Cape Town business class which involved a change in Dubai. These flights were on Boeing 777ER planes. Every aspect of the flights was of the highest standards such that for the first time in years we actually looked forward to our return flights! The service was excellent with courteous friendly staff and fabulous food and wine. The seats are roomy and comfortable and we slept for 6+ hours on the Dubai-Cape Town sector - well beyond what we have done on BA and other flights. The provision of mattresses for the seats is a wonderful idea. The entertainment system is superb. In addition the chauffeur cars are a great way to being and s=end a trip. Emirates is a great airline and I will definitely now switch to using them for future flights.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-03-03;Singapore - Nice return on a business trip with a transit in Dubai both ways. Overall the quality of the trip was good. Seats comfortable slide suite doors a bit gimmicky but definitely help with privacy / quietness for sleeping. Didn't eat on all legs but when I did the quality of the a la carte food was excellent. Drinks list wide. ICE system has great content but the tablet style controller is sometimes unresponsive. In flight wifi / mobile connectivity only available on one leg out of four which was disappointing as the one leg that had it was a night leg when I wanted to sleep! Emirates First lounge in DXB very comfortable. All flights on time. Only complaints are that the cabins seemed too warm and that Dubai airport remains a bit of a mess for transit. Might be better when all construction works complete. Price for this First trip was barely any higher than Singapore Airlines Business class to Europe so on that basis the value for money is good. This is a regular trip for me and I'd consider EK next time.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-28;Travelling back from Bangkok on 23rd Feb our flight was scheduled to land in Dubai Airport at 00.30 local time. Due to the fog from the previous day in Dubai we were told when checking in that our flight from Bangkok would be delayed 2 hours making our departure time 22.40 instead of 20.40. When we received our boarding passes they were printed with a departure time of 00.10 meaning a delay of 3.5 hours. After 4 + hours of no updated information they called us to the gates. Eventually arrive in Dubai at around 5.30 am local time 5 hours after our scheduled arrival time. After an hour or so with very little movement in queues peoples patience began to wear thin. After 3+ hours we decided to try somewhere else in the airport for answers I eventually got on a flight at 5pm that day and arrived home around 40 hours after leaving my hotel in Bangkok. I am fast approaching 60 years have travelled all over the world using many airlines have experienced delays before but never have I encountered such lack of care.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-28;LIS-DXB-KIX. Business Class. Two different experiences: LIS-DXB: Lisbon check-in was terrible. They even charged 6 kg (over 40 ridiculous) extra weight (at Euros48 per kg). Had to queue 50 min to pay them at a special counter with unprepared and unpleasant staff. Probably a gift for my 1st trip on EK. Boarding: total mess for all classes. No smile. Food wine and staff on board extremely pleasant. Brand new B777-300ER. Nice clean. DXB-KIX the opposite: fast boarding uneatable food very regular wines and no smile from staff except 1. Planes late on departure and arrival in both cases. no free Wi-fi in DXB. ICE great anyway. Flat bed is Ok.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-28;Emirates A380 Sydney to Auckland economy returning business using points. Excellent service although the economy breakfast left a little to be desired. Great IFE using Emirate's ICE system. All in all a pleasant experience.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-28;Sydney - Christchurch - Sydney. The flight over was acceptable with service pretty poor only one choice left out of two for the meal only one side of the sound in my headphones for IFE worked. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Flight back was poor. Flight was an hour late departing although they made up a lot of that time. Staff are quite rude tending to order you around and not showing much interest in customer comfort. My seat had a great big lump in the back like a spring had come loose or something. It was very uncomfortable. I told the FA who wasn't very interested but said she'd see if anything else was available after we took off. I told her I'd like to sit with my wife and she said 'its only a couple of hours so put up with it. It was so uncomfortable I'm not sure what I would have done if it had been a longer haul. food was OK had a choice this time IFE OK.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-27;EK842 DOH-DXB + EK075 DXB-CDG - Very disappointing flights experience with Emirates. Lounge in DOH + Boarding error in DXB + Seat broken on A380 + On board service I could not escape the unpleasant experiences. Even the cabin crew usually smiling were unpleasant on both sectors and on DXB-CDG made mistakes in bar service. My seat was broken on A380 DXB-CDG sector and didn't work at all on a fully booked flight… It's not the 1st time this year.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-27;"Economy B777-300ER from Manchester to Perth via Dubai. What a pleasant surprise when boarding at Manchester. The seat pitch was far more than I expected I am 5'8"" and there was more than enough room to stretch out. Yes the seats are narrow but I personally didn't find that to be a problem. The entertainment was ICE and not wide screen which was a disappointment as there wasn't as much on offer to watch as advertised. The food was great and the crew very attentive. Upon boarding at Dubai the IFE this time was ice wide screen and what a difference - absolutely superb. There was so much to choose from! Again the seating was great and the service first class. Return leg was the same routing. Only 84 passengers from Perth to Dubai so we were All able to stretch out and have a row each to ourselves. Older entertainment system again though. Return to Manchester was packed. Even more updated entertainment which huge screens hand held touchscreen device and a brilliant selection. Tip - if you're travelling economy on this type of aircraft try and get in the first section of economy as there's less people the no one walks past and no queue for the toilet. Avoid row 21 though as that is the last row of that cabin section and you do get people waiting for the toilet there. We had row 18 and 19ABC and they were great seats. I will definitely fly Emirates again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-27;EK 215 and EK 823. LAX-DXB and DXB-DMM. Pleasantly surprised was dreading this flight back because of the bad experience I had during the inbound flight. It wasn't a full flight and I had all 3 seats to myself so could lie down made the 16hours leg comfortable. Plenty of drink runs and the food was very good albeit a small quantity but it was spaced well so I wasn't hungry throughout. Attendants were attentive but some seemed disinterested and cabin service can get disorganized at times. ICE was great but did not use much and noticed its the same contents as before. Seemed like catering out of DXB was of poorer quality hence the return from LAX is better. Transit at DXB was good arrived in the evening so not a lot of people. DXB-DMM was a hit and miss food was very good or a 1 hour flight but cabin crew was very disorganized and always on a rush. Landing smooth and communication from the cockpits was ok. All in all was a much better flight than the previous one I had.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-26;EK 313 and EK 312 - 17th Feb and 22nd Feb 2014. I've done 2 flights in the last week with Emirates 1 in Business and 1 in Economy and I have to say it's been very hit and miss with the service and food served. The Economy flight DXB to Tokyo and the return was in Business. Funny thing was the Economy journey was better reasonable food and service. The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. The seats I found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around. We were delayed nearly 5 hours on-route because of fog in Dubai which is not the airlines fault of course but a lack of communicating left everyone wondering what was going on. I was very surprised overall by the quality of the business experience. I'll be sticking with Qantas!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-25;My wife and I flew EK414 etd Dubai 0150 in January 2014. This is a direct flight Dubai to Sydney on the A380. The business seats on the Emirates A380 appear roomy until you actually sit in one when you realize that the arrangement of everything around you actually quite crowds you. The extension of the food and beverage tray leaves very little room to move. The bed is actually a flat bed but the shoulder room is too squashed even for the average sized person that I am. This made it difficult to get any reasonable sleep. The hostess insisted on keeping the shutters down for the full 14 hours of the flight as we travelled from night to day and then into the night. I think that this contributed to our very first experience of jet lag and we have done quite a bit of travelling. The business class bar is wasted space.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-25;My wife and I flew on EK419 etd Sydney 1845 last September. The first leg on this B777 took us to Bangkok the second leg was to Dubai. Out of Sydney we tried to get some sleep and the hostess provided us with a thin mattress each for the flat but reclining bed. This initially seemed comfortable but we both awoke to find that we had slipped down the bed towards the footrest. On the second leg we dispensed with the mattress and we both had some good sleep. The reclining bed proved to be surprisingly comfortable and there is plenty of shoulder room to turn over in.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-21;As we checked in at London Gatwick for Emirates flight EK0016 we were told the flight was delayed 1 hour advised that there were around '30 of us' so there would probably be ground staff waiting for us to escort us to the connecting gate. We asked whilst in the air if we would make the connecting flight and were told we would arrive at 1am and therefore would have plenty of time to make our way to the connecting gate. Arrived at the airport disembarked and were met by ground staff at 1.40am who advised us the connecting flight had already left. We were sat in the connecting flight area while our baggage claim tickets were taken from us advised that they needed to rebook our flights. When we were given meal vouchers at 2.20am I asked how long we would be waiting for they couldn't give a time. Told we would be on the 9.55am Qantas flight to Sydney QF002. Given a hotel voucher and advised we needed to be back 2 hours before the flight to check-in. 5 hours at the hotel did not seem worth the hassle and we asked if we could instead use the Emirates lounge told no to this request. We finally got to the hotel at 4.30am. When we finally arrived back at Dubai airport to check in to our rebooked flight we were told that as it was an almost full flight there were no seats next to each other left and that we would be sitting in separate aisles and middle seats. We did not pay extra money to be on a flight that arrived at a convenient time in Sydney only to have this ordeal happen to us and to be put on a full flight where we could not even sit next to the person we booked our flight with. Our dietary requirements were not carried over to the next flight we were not given an apology for this or an alternative solution. other airline would have provided.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-20;Economy on EK405 (codeshare Qantas as QF8405) from Melbourne to Singapore on 19 Feb 2014. Emirates sent a B777-300 that was an older version without ICE digital but IMHO it is still much better than those found on Qantas A330-300s. The flight was operating below capacity hence most passengers had an entire row to themselves. Service staff ok dinner decent and entertainment options were very good. All in all a generally good flight to Singapore - nothing special but definitely not horrible. Worth flying again for the price paid.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-20;Outbound EK0062 from HAM-DXB (Aug 2nd 2013) and EK0372 from DXB-BKK (Aug 3rd 2013). Inbound EK0373 from BKK-DXB (Jan 23rd 2014) and EK0061 from DXB-HAM (Jan 24th 2014). Entertainment system is above everything else I have tried. The food and drink options are the best I have tried in Economy. They offered juice and water multiple times after food was served and if you turned on your lights the staff came right away. On my way home I had a few hours to spend in Dubai and one of the attendant took a lot of time to tell me about Dubai - what to see transportation how much money to exchange etc. Overall I more felt I was flying business than Economy.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-20;Flew MAN-DXB-KUL and return flew on the new A380 the first leg and was very impressed with the seating meal and drink service plane only 1/2 full. Staff very friendly and efficient. The second leg was on the 777 to Melbourne Via KL. What a horrible journey seating was very tight and plane was full to capacity. Service onboard was not good at all food was bad and the drinks service only came once. Staff seemed to be more intent on chatting in the galley than actually serving the passengers. The return was no better from DXB to MAN but plane was not even half full so this made it a bit more bearable. Why does Emirates insist on over crowding the 777. Will only fly Emirates if the journey is on the A380.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-19;Flight EK 384 from Bangkok to Hong Kong on Feb 13th 2014. The flight was delayed for almost an hour. However they did arrive in Hong Kong 20 minutes late. The food and beverage was great and plentiful. The IFE good and the seat was comfortable for a short flight.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-19;Flight EK 385 from Hong Kong to Bangkok on Feb 15th 2014. The flight left and arrived on time. The food and beverage was OK except coffee and tea was not served due to time constraints. IFE and seat was good.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-18;BHX to CMB and back. The first flight to CMB was awful we had to wait 2 hours more then expected I had a baby and my son with me and they did not offer my children any meals or food for the whole flight. My son was upset because he did not receive the small backpack with colouring pencils and a colouring book (which you normally get for kids). The return flight however was pleasant we did get food this time and the crew was friendly! We paid enough money for the ticket so I hope next time will be a lot better on both flights.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-17;Flew Manchester to Tokyo Haneda with transit in Dubai. Both planes 777. Was very happy to be upgraded from business to first between MAN and DXB. The free car service to/from airport was excellent. EK's lounge at MAN is world class - a full free buffet restaurant and excellent showers with full hotel style towel pack on request. The business lounge at DXB also very good: full free buffet restaurant service. Quite full but so many seats that there was no problem in finding somewhere comfortable to sit. MAN-DXB: service in almost empty first cabin was exceptional with stunning food and extremely comfortable private seat. DXB-HND: business seats a tad narrow but long offering a fair degree of privacy and slept well with the additional mattress provided. Food and service both extremely good. Plane was a little old and sad and would have benefited from small repairs and adjustments to fittings but everything worked and was very clean. I fly EK reasonably often but can always find new content on the excellent ICE AV system. The Emirates' Saver Business ticket represented extremely good value even without the upgrade to first several hundred pounds cheaper than European carriers with the plus of free car service included.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-13;Flew BKK-SYD on Feb 7th. Business class lounge closed for refurbishment. Very shocked at the low standard of the substitute Qantas lounge - extremely average. Cheap wine and almost no food. Business class cabin was full. Dinner service on overnight flight was average. No amenities kit on 9+ hour overnight flight. Surprisingly second rate IFE - no comparison with premium routes. Breakfast was continental - it consisted of fruit dry croissant and coffee. Overall this was an extremely average experience. The seats are fine so great for sleeping but the service and product beyond that are non-existent.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-12;DMM-DXB and DXB-LAX. DMM-LAX: flight attendants look as if they don't want to be there delayed flight due to late turn around of the plane. A general sense of being disorganized. Good: ICE system and fruit meal for an hour flight. DXB airport is too crowded just too many people. DXB-LAX: full flight with very little service throughout. Only one drinks service call light largely ignored. Food was poor and service was an eternity only one full meal. Snacks were not served. Seats are uncomfortable. Good: few FAs were attentive toilets were clean and ICE system was good. Overall: not a good flight. I'm not looking forward to my return flight.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-12;Flew a 777 Adelaide-Dubai-Istanbul - Reasonable service but very slow. The A380 return flight Amsterdam-Dubai - service was shocking. We had finished our entrée and were still waiting for a glass of wine! We had finished our main course and were still waiting for a glass of wine. I will never fly Emirates again. We went Emirates because they fly direct from Adelaide and they were a ONE WORLD affiliate but next time we go overseas (Europe in June 2015) we will go to Sydney or Melbourne and fly Qantas!;NEGATIVE

Glasgow to Sydney: It was 3 hours before they offered the first drink I was thirsty so asked for a drink before take off after that I was still thirsty so I pressed my button for assistance but no one came. It wasn't until after the meals came around 3 hours into the flight that I got offered a drink. The breakfast options were both egg options so if you don't like egg you are not getting a meal.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-10;Flew from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on February 4th this year in coach/economy. The cabin crew seemed very disinterested. The seat was broken and I had to repair it myself on the Mumbai to Dubai (Flt 509) leg of the journey. The overnight portion of the trip (Dubai to JFK Flt 203) was very unpleasant principally due to the over abundance of passengers traveling with young children who screamed the entire flight. It was impossible to read or watch a movie. The flight attendants simply didn't want to be bothered.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-10;Travelled business class EK 379 from Phuket to Dubai and EK 025 the next day from Dubai to Glasgow on Feb 1. Phuket Airport was very busy and the business class lounge operated by a local company was awful. We were chaperoned from check in desk to this lounge bypassing the long queues which was very helpful. Overnight flight. The flat bed was not very comfortable but I saw on the next flight a mattresses being provided. These were not on offer but may have made a big difference. The limousine service at Dubai and Glasgow were excellent. The flight to Glasgow was also on time and very comfortable. The food was average and poorly presented.;POSITIVE

Limo collection most helpful. Glasgow business class lounge is poor. The food on both sectors was ordinary. The food presentation was pretty poor.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-10;Flew WAW-DXB on old A330 aircraft. The business class seat was not fully reclining but was still very comfortable. The inflight entertainment was old and needed updating. Many channels couldn't be accessed and the ones that were had functional text (eg volume brightness) on the screen which couldn't be removed. The service and food was excellent though they did forget to serve us our cheese and biscuits. They were very apologetic about that and managed to serve it literally 15 mins before landing.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-07;Seattle-Dubai-Sydney. Our flights from Sydney to Dubai to Seattle were mediocre. Customer Service was marginal in terms of FA attentiveness and politeness. Our son had a child's meal ordered and it was delivered 45 minutes before we were served our meal. While the A380 had a dedicated restroom attendant from Sydney to Dubai that was not the case on the 777-200ER on the Dubai to Seattle route. Two restrooms became inoperative during this flight and the remaining ones were filthy by the time we arrived in Seattle. The ICE entertainment system was the best feature of the flights. Good selection of movies/TV shows and News.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-07;Emirates used to be good 2 years ago. I flew from JFK to Bangladesh through Milan then Dubai (8 hours flight each way). It was a very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor. Coming back was 39 hours trip. When I pressed the call button staff no one came for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). I had to get up and get the water myself after 90 minutes of waiting. I paid over $2.500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats were so close together that the passenger next to me had to place his leg on my side just to fit into his seat. The only good thing I can say about my trip was that the food and entertainment system was good.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-07;Routing was FRA-DXB on a B777 new configuration with suites in First class. Plenty of space excellent food and drinks 20 year old Bordeaux wine premium whiskeys. The suite is spacious and you can close the door for privacy. Return flight was business class also in a B-777 as usual good service and good food. First time in the new lounge at Terminal 3 in Dubai which was also a good experience not so crowded as in the old Terminal and better atmosphere.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-07;A380 flight from JFK - Dubai - Kuala Lumpur early in December 2013 with my wife and 3-year old son. 1st leg: JFK- Dubai-KL. On the JFK - Dubai route they flew the A380 which was nearly full. It was an 11 pm flight - the crew only began to start serving food 4-hrs after take-off! My son did not receive his complimentary inflight toy set they did give the toys out but ran out before reaching us. Always had to do a 'reminder' request for water or drinks! Dubai - KL route: they flew us in a very old A330 - flight was cramped and the seats smelt! The surface of my seat was worn out and torn. The air-conditioning and ventilation wasn't working before the flight and performed poorly in the air. Return leg (KL - Dubai): The A380 plane blacked-out when the plane was boarded and engineers had to come on board to fix the problem. During this time the plane was dark very stuffy no any offer from the crew to provide drinks. Lots of apologies from the captain though but the flight was delayed almost an hour.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-05;JFK to Dubai-Lahore and Islamabad to Dubai-JFK. A380 to Dubai and 777-300 to Pakistan. All four flights completely filled to capacity. Meals were good service prompt and courteous. Sitting back in row 83 takes about 20 minutes until exiting the A380 after landing. The highlight is the Emirates ICE on-demand entertainment system. Obtained mileage accrual with partner airline JetBlue.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-05;DXB-BKK - Business. Upgraded with milesEK are pulling a fast one with Skywards members in that part of the biz class package is chauffeur pick up and drop. You must upgrade at the airport and hope there are seats which will cost you 45000 miles which is huge amount of miles for a simple seat upgrade. Staff were good to BKK on the A380 food as usual not good small portions menu offers soup etc its never given main course Birani again? Rice as a main in business class? Wines are being cut back. Overall average there and back entertainment good as ever. Return on 772-300 older model needs an upgrade its well over 10 years interiors and seat has seen better days with padding poor. Staff on this leg insisted that lights stay on full blast until 5 passengers complained that they wished to sleep as a 8 am Departure Senior refused until 4 hours into the flight.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-05;Nairobi to Manchester via DXB and back. Having loyally used Emirates for the last couple of years I am extremely disappointed with EK719 DXB-NRB flight back home on 3rd Feb. As if the discomfort was not enough the seat pockets were a shambles torn and hanging. An attendant loudly said to a passenger in response as to why he doesn't take flight meals I totally agree with you on this. This while serving the rest of us. Such a pity really.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-05;Perth to Dubai and then Dubai to Istanbul and return. Main problem is no water or drinks served until 4 hours into a 10.5 hr flight. Service awful. On board entertainment broken for one entire 10.5 hour leg of flight. Really terrible experience. Food was inedible apart from a salad on one of the legs.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-04;DUB-PER 23/1/14 QF8424. Plane old and dirty - disorganised boarding people in my seat refusing to move as they wanted to sit together requiring cabin crew to intervene. In flight entertainment not working. No food or drinks service until nearly 4 hours in to a 10 hour flight. Food served poor quality and cold. When asking for a glass of wine and water cabin crew initially refused saying one drink only (only drinks offered during the 2 meal services). Seat pocket broken. Would not not not recommend unless they upgrade the planes going in to Perth.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-04;"The first class ""service"" on this Auckland-Melbourne flight was atrocious and for the money I paid totally unacceptable. Food service was chaotic - I had to ask for bread wine and salad dressing was offered with dessert! The person sitting next to me almost didn't get any dinner at all because nobody took her order. No tea or coffee was offered after dinner and repeated calls to flight attendants were ignored. They didn't seem to know what they were doing and spent most of the flight hanging around in the galley area chatting. The good news? Very comfortable seats and great inflight entertainment but they didn't compensate for some of the worst service (any class any airline) I have ever experienced. I'm going back to Singapore Airlines.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-02-03;Singapore-Melbourne B777. I've previously said I'd never fly with them again but this time I had no choice so I owe them an update. The flight was OK food wasn't outstanding. Breakfast was awful. I always find Emirates staff and service to be inconsistent across sectors. The ICE entertainment system is very good and there's lots to choose from. The planes are always modern and clean. I prefer Etihad for the food and service and just Emirates for the entertainment.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-02-03;EK 407 AKL-MEL First Class A380-800. First class cabin crew seemed very disorganised inattentive uninterested and lacking proper management. Pre-flight drinks (champagne only no juice no water) were offered to some pax but not others snack baskets missing from some suites several calls to flight attendants ignored no pre-dinner drinks offered. Menu and wine list given but no dinner order taken until I eventually attracted someone's attention and by then it was almost too late. No duty free order taken complicated seat adjustment/entertainment controls not explained despite requests customs forms handed out only after final descent. In order to get anyone's attention (call button was repeatedly ignored) I went back to the galley to find the flight attendants sitting around giggling and gossiping. Very sloppy and unprofessional and not what I pay a First Class fare for.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-31;29th Jan Dubai to Perth. Took an hour to check in and drop bags. Plane delayed an hour without telling passengers. Everyone was herded into a tiny departure room so we could wait in discomfort. Had booked kids meals they didn't arrive. Staff stormed off and came back with kids meals. Rest of the food was some of the worst dried out pasta scrambled eggs with the consistency of mashed potato for breakfast. Asked for another drink it never came. Overnight flight included the cabin screens flashing bright white every 20 mins. 25 Jan London to Dubai. Same carry on with kids meals. Very average service and food. Had to wait 40 minutes for bags after we had cleared passport control. Very disappointed.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-31;Sydney to Dubai. Treated myself to a Miles upgrade. What an experience. Huge individual pod pyjamas duvet and mattress. Kruger and Leuwin to drink caviar a long comfortable sleep - then a shower. A real treat.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-31;Heathrow to Perth and Dubai to Heathrow. A really good experience I cannot fault anything other than the cost. A380 is a joy upstairs and the quality in the 777 Business contrasts with the below average and cramped economy.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-31;Flew LHR-DXB return in January of this year. Seat on A380 spacious and comfortable ICE system great toilets clean flights largely on time. Only problem is the dreadful cabin crew. So disorganised and slow when serving meals. Took 2 hours on the LHR-DXB flight to be offered a drink. In the end I went up to the galley area where the crew were just chatting and asked for water. Meal was served 3 hours into a 6 hour night flight so no one got any sleep. Not a single drinks run after that. Service truly appalling compared to airlines like Singapore airlines. Also no comfort kit was provided - socks toothbrush etc which I suppose is a minor thing. Return flight was better as there was one drinks run. Still not great though. Wouldn't choose to fly with them again.;NEGATIVE

emirates;2014-01-30;This was our first time flying to Perth Australia via Dubai with Emirates what a pleasant experience. Staff very attentive and economy class was very comfortable. I was dreading the long flights but found watching a couple of movies on each flight passed the time and two meals on each flight where acceptable and complementary drinks was a nice touch. Will definitely use this airline again good value for money.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-29;My 13 year old recently flew as an unaccompanied minor with Emirates on a return trip from Perth Australia to Glasgow (via Dubai). He arrived back in Perth with us yesterday and I have to say I have been very impressed with this service from start to finish. We were naturally dubious about him flying alone at first but Emirates were organised efficient and professional. They even upgraded him to first class for one leg of the trip. I would have no hesitation using this service again if need be.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-28;Travelled business class on EK434 23 Jan and EK435 26 Jan BNE-AKL-BNE (A380-800). Consistently good service on both flights with attentive crew and impressive product. Seats very comfortable and would definitely make for a pleasant long haul flight. IFE boasts extensive selection of movie/music/TV options. Bar lounge is a terrific space to stretch one's legs and socialise with others. Food a little basic for business class standards and some crew lacked wine knowledge but this didn't really impact too much on the overall experience. Our travel agent ordered a surprise cake for us to celebrate our impending marriage and the crew made a fuss even taking a Polaroid picture for us to commemorate the occasion - such a lovely gesture all round! Would not hesitate to fly EK again in the future.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-28;12 Dec 2013 Flight EK004 from LHR. Staff on Emirates flight from London to Dubai are getting worse. They ignored both my children (5 and 8 years old) no toys. They did not have the ordered meals for the children. Head steward claimed I had not ordered them but I had proof that I had ordered them. These are A380 flight crew - what is the point in getting a new flight when the staff cannot meet the basics needs of passengers.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-28;I have flown with Emirates on 8 occasions (Economy) and the flight from Dubai to Gatwick on December 29th 2013 will be the last I have given the airline the benefit of doubt for too long already. Their prices are sky high and the service on board is chaotic. The staff are friendly enough but uncoordinated. The last 3 times they ran out of the meal I would have preferred. Flying out to Dubai this Christmas it was 3.5 hours into the flight before we received a meal at all and it was cold. On yet another flight they forgot to serve regular meals (those not pre-booked) to the whole block of seats from the rearward bulkhead onward. On a new A380 a couple of years ago I flew to Dubai from Heathrow with part of the ceiling flapping about above my head. On 2 occasions the ICE entertainment system was faulty. My main complaint though is with the poor cabin service.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-25;"I flew with my wife in Business class this month from Manchester to Dubai and then changed for another Emirates flight to Singapore. We returned some 7 days later 4 flights with Emirates 3 on the A380 and one on a 777-300. The seats on the A380 are fully flat but so narrow only 18.5"" (basically an economy class seat that goes flat) and not very comfortable. The 777 seats are a bit wider 20.5"" but not full flat. The cabin service on all 4 flights was awful they have so many different nationalities that clearly do not work well together and they have no real interest in the passengers. They are not organised never smile and do not seem to know what they are doing. Dubai airport itself is a disaster chaotic no helpful ground staff. One of the Business Class lounges was OK but the other one in the older Terminal I think was dirty and run down. We paid over £4500 for the flights I feel really hard done by.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-24;Flew JNB-DXB-LHR. Excellent service and amazing selection of the latest movies and TV series. Both aircraft's (777-300er and A380) were brand new and very comfortable. I have flown this route many times and will always look for a deal with Emirates before looking elsewhere as I know that I can expect the best.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-24;JNB to SEA via DXB 8 hours to DXB 4 hrs transfer time in DXB plus 14.5 hrs DXB-SEA. Overall impression is very good as I arrived in SEA feeling OK and managed a full day of activities despite the nearly 30 hours spent travelling. Flight from JNB-DXB was very full with a few strange seat allocations by ground staff resulting in seat shuffle for many passengers in the Biz cabin so families could sit together etc. Service and food was good although a little rushed. presumably to maximise sleep-time on this 8hr flight. ICE system required re-setting once but then worked well. Staff remembered not to wake me as requested and I was woken with 30min to landing and still offered a quick croissant and yoghurt which was appreciated. 7/10 for this flight overall. Dubai lounge was impressive in terms of size and space although I skipped breakfast. Lounge could possibly do with a few more private areas. I boarded the DXB-SEA flight dreading the 15-odd hours of further flying but this turned out to be a fantastic flight. Half-empty in Biz with professional friendly and chatty crew and a real step up in meal quality over the previous night's flight. I spent the flight alternating between the food and drink sleeping and the huge selection on the entertainment system. I was particularly impressed with their music choice. Only negative comment on the ICE system is that while the size and clarity of the screens are great the screens are so big that it can be very distracting if someone is sitting next to you and watching the TV as well. No such issues on the DXB-SEA flight as I was alone in a pair of seats but seating mishaps on the full JNB-DXB flight meant I had two huge screens from my neighbours as well as mine to contend with when trying to watch a movie. Overall very happy with my experience as it made the extra-long trip very manageable.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;BKK-DXB Jan 2014. Bangkok Emirates lounge ancient tiny and poorly laid out. Food and beverage choice was however very good. Boarding gate minutes+ from lounge. A380 upper deck boarding via air bridge. Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapés at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese. Arrival into Dubai as on time. Very pleasant experience overall A380 is spacious luxurious and a smooth quiet ride on upper deck.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;DXB-MAN Jan 2014. Dubai lounge again was very satisfactory stunning array of food and beverages on offer and very busy for all the early morning wave. Boarding on time and direct to aircraft from lounge via a lift. Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out. Food and beverages - food quite average to be honest only 1 dish got me excited. Choice of drinks good with good quality wines too. Entertainment systems are impressive but found content lacking in comparison with Cathay Pacific and BA. Punctuality was good with only minimal delays on departures at times.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;DXB-BKK Jan 2014. Business lounge impressive at Dubai shower facilities clean and spacious. Food and beverage offer good also. Direct lounge to boarding gate access via lift. Older Boeing 777-300 showing its age but still clean and Business cabin well presented. Very friendly and attentive crew through out. Red eye service lights kept nice and dim throughout after take off snack and supper menu was nice - deli sandwich fresh. Inflight entertainment system functionality impressive but lacking in good movie or tv choice. Breakfast prior to landing was decisively average and serving method seems very bitty. On time arrival into Bangkok.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;MAN-DXB-MAN. Business Lounge was ok nice breakfast. Boarding gate quite a walk from the lounge - T1 pier at Manchester basic and clinical feeling. Boeing 777-300ER was clean and Business cabin was well presented. Crew professional and well groomed - Business friendly. Boarding drinks service promptly after seated. Departure on- time after take off drinks order taken - delivered 1 hour later. Excuse stock in economy. Two meal services Breakfast (average) and Dinner before landing (Ok). Not overly impressed with the quality and taste of the dishes. Attentiveness of crew throughout the flight good Inflight entertainment functionally impressive but choice of films and tv poor. Toilets clean and well stocked. Seat very good fully lie flat with massage function - privacy could be improved. On time arrival into Dubai.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;Traveled DXB-DAR-DXB on Boeing 777-300. Crew was friendly but responded to call after 2 hours. The entertainment system was ICE and had millions of movies and TV Shows to last you a year let alone a 5 hour flight. Seats were comfy but less legroom. Food was excellent no complaints. Overall I really enjoyed Emirates and would recommend it to anyone.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-23;Flights EK412 and 410 between Auckland and Australia. As an airline they are OK - but nothing special. Cabin crew not that good. Have had much better service on cheaper airlines. The A380 economy seats are better than some airlines narrower seats. Boarding and getting off the A380 is a real pain so slow! Maybe its part airport problem also - but it will need fixing. Movie selection large. Not good value for money.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-22;FRA-PER via DXB Dec 2013. Seating comfort was very poor and comparable to a cheap charter airline. Cabin Service was as poor as the seating. The crew were uninterested and unfriendly to the passengers. One FA was not able to form a complete sentence when he asked after the passengers wish (Chicken? Beef? Coffee?). FA call signs were generally ignored. If you want a bottle of water you had to proceed to the galley. This was our first and last flight with Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-21;Flew 2 way from JFK-Dubai-Manila last Nov Jan respectively. The A380 was a nice airplane with decent seats but the inflight service was underwhelming. The serving of the food was very disorganised and meal selections were always not available. The attendants were serving the coffee/tea at the same time they were serving the meal and beverage. Flight attendants were ignoring flight attendant call signal/buttons. I was disappointed thinking that the flight to Manila via Dubai would be better as the fare was more expensive and longer. The inflight services on flights via Asian routes are much much better no comparison.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-21;"Flew SYD-DXB-GRU-DXB-SYD in December and January. I am a Qantas Gold Frequent Flyer and had originally booked Economy but I upgraded to Business for the first leg and then received further upgrades on subsequent flights. Second time I have flown Emirates and was very impressed. Easy check-in in Sydney and Sao Paulo and transit in Dubai very easy. Found all staff both inflight and on ground extremely friendly and helpful. Meals on all flights were excellent with a wide variety of choices - all accompanied by some excellent wines. The ICE - entertainment system offered incredibly varied options of entertainment. My only complaint was the angled lie flat bed on the B777-300 - I have a real thing about angled lie flat bed. Luggage arrived quickly and the ""Priority"" tag seemed if it actually meant something with Emirates - I am sure it is for appearance factor only on other airlines. Overall the flights were highly enjoyable relaxing and I would definitely use Emirates again.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-20;EK005 7th Jan Business class with my wife and two boys aged 7 and 4. Very disappointing. The pre-ordered children's meals were not available! I was told by the FA that they had been given to other children. Why were there not sufficient meals on board? I can understand if an adult choice is not available but an airline of this supposed stature should not do this. The adult choices were spicy or containing beef which we do not eat. When I complained the FA giggled and offered me a drink! The service was disorganised and awful. I will avoid Emirates in the future!;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-20;"Travelled London to New Zealand via Dubai and Sydney. Inflight entertainment was superb but unfortunately that's about the only positive thing I can say about the airline. Of the half dozen requests made to the in flight staff all were turned down and we're not talking about anything special. Examples such as. ""can I have a new set of headphones these don't work"" ""can you please fix my screen as it won't turn on"". Food service was shambolic children's meals being sent out up to an hour before the rest of the service crew walking around randomly with a couple of trays looking for people repeated offers to give me a child's meal even though I had never asked for one! So inefficient. Once the main service started the crew constantly ran out of options condiments bread rolls etc. because they were blocking the aisles for so long people who had been served wanted to use the rest rooms and the crew didn't want to let them past and didn't want to clear up the children's trays which in some cases were there from 2 hours before. Having the inflight entertainment interrupted for Emirates advertising is pretty irritating too especially when you are trying to settle children down who don't want a seat belt on pre take off. Lastly - would it hurt the crew to treat the passengers like customers? Smile respond to passenger calls and don't stand around the galleys gossiping. Won't be flying myself and family again and wouldn't recommend Emirates.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-17;HAM-DXB-HAM with B777. As always EK flight was fairly pleasant even when both flights have been packed. Entertainment system is second to none space and food better than with all European airlines. Service good both flights have been more or less in time. Check in procedure efficient. Unfortunately this time it happens to me that the stewardess spilled some coffee over my sweater. She felt very embarrassed and apologised with champagne from biz class.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-17;The 777 kills it. The expected A380 between Kuala Lumpur and Dubai was switched a few day ago for the Boeing 777. What a let down. Yes the A380 is great but the seating on most 777s does not provide enough space and I am a normal shape. The idea of sitting at an angle or hugging the next guy for 7 hours does not appeal to me enough to change airline which will offer me a wider seat. The 777 is a gold mine for the airline but not suited too narrow for an extra seat.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-17;We flew Sydney - Dublin return and it was underwhelming to say the least. The service on board was very poor meals were rushed and it took over an hour and two requests to get a glass of water on more than one occasion. The cabin crew were at best not very friendly with some being extremely rude. Passengers who needed to use the washroom during the meal service were told by one crew member to wait until after the service or they would not get back to their seat.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-16;I flew Ho Chi Minh City transiting in Dubai to London Heathrow. I usually fly Thai because it's the fastest route by far but the recent political protests in BKK made me think it was probably unwise to transit through Bangkok at the moment. I was deeply disappointed with the seat on the HCMC to Dubai leg of the journey. I was expecting one of those not quite flat angled seat beds but it wasn't even that. The 777-200 on that route is just a reclining seat. Since the flight leaves at 00.40 in the morning I was hoping to get at least some sleep before Dubai. I fly business class to get the sleep. I might as well have flown economy. The food was very mediocre as well. However staff were very nice. The business class lounge in Dubai is excellent. I can't praise it highly enough. The food is great the showers are wonderful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The second leg of the journey was on the A380 the seat was lovely - a fully flat bed in one of those little cubicles. Unfortunately this leg of the trip was during daylight hours so everyone was being very noisy and so despite the bed I couldn't get any sleep and arrived exhausted. The food on this leg of the journey was perfectly okay. The staff were all polite but strangely distracted and not terribly co-ordinated on this leg. The wait between first course and main was about 40 minutes. Very odd. I don't know if anyone from Emirates every reads these things but if they do - could you please put earplugs in the amenity kits? All in all I'd say that although Thai planes are a little older and shabbier the cabin crew are better trained and co-ordinated the food is better the seats may not be totally lie flat but at least you get to lie down on the flights. And most importantly they always give you ear plugs.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-15;Recently flown Emirates while on holiday with my family to Singapore and Sydney from New Zealand. I have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. Despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements I had a distressing experience using this airline. It was awful from check-in to landing. The customer service was terrible at the check-in desk. The Emirates crew at Sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. At check-in I explained that I'd like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. Check-in staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. Having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. The lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why I wasn't in a transit chair. She refused to process my boarding early. She ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. When I refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and I to continue toward the entrance of the plane. On board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a Cabin Service Manager (CSM) comes to say “hello”and make sure all is OK. I was totally ignored. The food was terrible to say the least. Flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. When we landed I had to wait for other passengers to get off first. Once the cabins were cleared I was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. My heart sank. I asked where my chair was and I asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. I pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and I was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. Within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. What could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. I am hesitant to travel with Emirates again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-15;Bangkok to Sydney departing 10/1/14 QF 8418. Very disappointing after all the hype. Check in was a long and tedious process and between my wife and I we were a couple of kilos over the checked baggage allowance and had to argue the toss for them to allow to 2 kilos over between the two of us. Boarding at Bangkok was confusing. The inflight service was not too bad except we were served breakfast missing the promised croissants and whe we brought this to the cabin crews attention they found two cold ones for us. We had to ask three times for our Sydney arrival cards to be given to us. The entertainment system is excellent. Following our first experience with Emirates would not recommend them as a first choice airline as there are better alternatives. Emirates is either expanding too fast or resting on its laurels.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-14;MEL-KUL-DXB-DEL COK-DXB-KUL SIN-MEL (the latter-most operated by QF). Return ticket (AUD1250) was excellent value for money. One of the more noticeable (but unfortunate) features was the rather surly and cold service across all EK flights. Most attendants were not too friendly concentrating on mechanically serving their flights which were fully booked. However food and beverage was solid and entertainment was excellent. Some points about particular flights: The EK409 MEL-KUL-DXB flight was unusually full of large families with young children so be prepared for a screaming economy cabin if booking this flight I would hazard a guess. This is not ideal especially given that the flight leaves MEL a few hours after midnight when you'd want a sleep. EK give me an opportunity to upgrade my COK-DXB flight to business through email for AUD330 which I took up. It was an amazing experience (for someone who has never flown business before). Service (unlike the economy service) was very warm friendly without being overbearing and the food and drink was excellent and constant (I ordered extra bread and dessert brought out very willingly). One of the attendants even got out a staff camera to take a picture for me which was a nice touch to the flight as I had told them it was my first time on business class. EK346 DXB-KUL on the A380 didn't seem any different from other aircraft although the inflight wifi was a added bonus. Overall I'd recommend EK for the excellent price but don't expect tip-top Singapore Airlines-type service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-14;FRA-DXB / SIN-DXB / DXB-FRA. One of the most overrated airlines in my opinion. Seats and food okay but not more than average. Cabin crew far to young to provide professional service. All service rounds appeared quite disorganized and took ages. Crew friendly but more into interaction with themselves than with the passengers. It´ s a pity that QF is codesharing with this airline on the FRA-SYD route.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-13;Business class Dubai to Los Angeles - 16 hour flight regular fare and the entertainment system did not work on my seat kept resetting itself. Cabin attendant friendly but apart from resetting (which he did about 5-6 times) he didn't offer any other options. After nearly 3 hours I asked for the purser who re-set yet again twice and finally offered a change of seat. The selection of the entertainment wasn't great. Food average. I took another trip in December to Europe again due to the direct connection but again very poor selection on entertainment and food was not good at all. I would book Emirates again or recommend to family/friends but only if the price is much lower than other options.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-13;Perhaps it really doesn't quite get any better than this. Traveling in Emirates suites on the 777-300ER from Bangkok to Amsterdam is pure luxury and there are less than a handful of airlines that can compete with this product. The suite is luxuriously appointed very private and the seat converts into a very plush bed. You may as well be flying in a private jet. The service is impeccable. From the champagne Arabic coffee and dates that greet you prior to take-off to the a la carte food menu that you can choose to eat at any time the service is attentive friendly but not over-bearing. Perhaps the only complaint for the 777-300ER product would be that the lavatories are a bit cramped. Given that you want to change into your pj's prior to take-off there could be a bit more space to change.;POSITIVE

emirates;2014-01-10;"Flew from HK to Lyon via Dubai for Xmas holiday. I usually fly with Cathay but this trip with Emirates was much cheaper this time and since I had never tried Emirates before I gave it a try. Overall it was good but I think it depends on the aircraft you are in. For HK to Dubai was in a Boeing 777 seems a brand new one inflight entertainment was excellent! For Dubai to Lyon was in a A340-500 not bad either but the inflight entertainment was not as great as the on the Boeing. For the return trip was in a A330 inflight entertainment was really disappointing. Food was ok as well as staff. Compared to Cathay I would say that Emirates' crew is not as friendly as Cathay's (less smile seem to be quite ""cold"" sometimes). Nevertheless for the value for money I think I will fly again with them.";POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-09;DXB-DUB - Business class out and Y class back. Gold Member. The experience is a mixed bag outward in Biz pick up on time. Flight on time lounge is to me nothing but an upgrade from the main terminal with free food and drink. Staff all look over stretched and it is not in comparison to other leading airlines where you can have a quiet zone to work. Its over crowded  busy and too open meaning that all sounds travel. Flight fine very full. Staff did their job but lacked any interaction skills. Return in Y again flight over booked their policy of 3x4x3 seating on the 777 is just too tight. ICE as ever was good and staff were not attentive pressed the call button numerous time  they walked past me. Vanished for over 2-3 hours mid flight. Food on both legs was terrible had ordered a low cholesterol meal with low fat. Both times a salad with lettuce and tomato no dressing and fish in biz class was actually burnt so bad to was like plastic. I asked for an alternative and they had Biriyani. You get better in Y class on Saudia for a 1.5 hour flight. In Y class on return chicken breast that you could put through a window and white rice inedible. Its a pity Qatar don't start entering this route as I would gladly fly them in future. Emirates are expanding at a fast track rate but seem to be loosing the edge when maintaining standards.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-09;In December I flew Emirates on 4 different occasions from Copenhagen to Dubai/Bangkok and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. The most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. On the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. The check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who don't understand the boarding priorities. The food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself. I will travel with Emirates again if I will get a good price but not for the comfort and service level.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-09;Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow on 5th January 2014. The prices are reasonable and the service is quite good. 2 years ago I felt the attitude of the cabin crew was poor so I avoided the airline after that. The staff were not responding to calls and was even rude to passengers. This year I thought I'd use Emirates again. I rang my call button twice and both times it took them more than half an hour to respond. They just didn't seemed bothered about serving. The food was served very late. In summary Emirates is a good airline but they just need to buck up with the cabin crew service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-08;MEL-AKL-MEL A380. Check in was easy and pleasant staff onboard were professional and helpful. Emirates are fantastic when travelling with children. A380 aircraft is comfortable and pleasant to travel in and the bar at 40 thousand feet a wow factor. Food was good for airline food. Ice entertainment excellent. I would recommend.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-08;GLA-DXB-BKK-DXB-GLA. I flew from Glasgow on the evening flight to Dubai on EK 026 on 10 Dec and have to say the service from the cabin crew was outstanding and very friendly. Meals and drinks were given in good quantities and the service was fantastic for a night flight. Well done However next flight on EK 372 to Bangkok on the A380 was appalling and inappropriate for the standard of Emirates. No bar service bad food and poor cabin crew. I feel bad in saying this. Return flight was on 07 Jan on EK 371 evening flight to Dubai service was again outstanding friendly cabin crew poor food as only breakfast but it was a late night flight. Good full bar service and outstanding cabin crew which did an excellent job. Last flight was on EK027 and the cabin crew were excellent food was very good and a good bar service which was up to Emirates high standards. I have been flying with Emirates for over 10 years and reached Gold status but now have Blue status. I feel that overall Emirates is excellent good value for money have excellent cabin crew which fly on modern aircraft with a good safety record. The downside is the A380 flights are a hit and miss and overrated. Also I feel Emirates has expanded too quickly to take on other middle east airlines and that the Emirates high standards are falling.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-06;SYD-AKL-MEL A380. Very disappointing I have flown Emirates about 10 times and it is consistently deteriorating now to the point where it is not worth bothering with. The previously generous and hi-spec economy meals have been replaced with a smaller tray with much lower quality food. The crew on both flights were unprofessional to the point of it being quite sad on the first flight the service was a shambolic mess and on the second they were far more concerned with flirting with each other and chatting rather than serving passengers. Call bells were never answered meal service took far too long on both flights and the toilets were utterly revolting despite the newish aircraft. Only good part is the IFE. Sorry to say I won't fly Emirates ever again.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-06;DXB-FCO-DXB with A380-800. Wonderful experience starts at the A380 dedicated hub a modern brand new mall with excellent food and shopping offering. Boarding despite the aircraft size and the number of fellow passengers is fairly fast. Seating is spacious and the seat when laid back moves both the back and the seat giving the feeling of having double the inclination and increasing the comfort. Food was served and it was very tasty probably one my best experience in economy class. The entertainment screen was outstanding endless channels games and not to mention the WIFI available onboard and the fact that mobile was working perfectly while cruising at 39000 feet. Amazing experience for an economy class flight both outbound and inbound.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-06;Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on First with my wife. Two cars came to pick us up from the hotel and after insisting that one is enough for both of us and our baggage I sent of the other car. Check-in was pretty quick and the staff at the counter noticed that it was my wife's birthday so he chatted with us while processing our baggage. Immigration clearance was done swiftly with the fast track card. Spent an hour at the lounge before making our way to the boarding gate. FAs welcomed us warmly and ushered us to our suites. I have planned to surprise my wife with a cake so I arranged for it over the phone with Emirates contact centre way before my travel date. The suite was big as A380's (We flew on a B777-300ER) and the crew were excellent. Pre-take off drink with nuts Arabic coffee with dates cold towels Bvlgari amenity kits Pyjamas and Menu card were distributed while taxing for take-off. They offered an a la carte dinning with wide variety of selections. The food was fantastic. Especially the Arabic mezze (a must try). Restaurant quality food and the service were efficient. Plates were cleared promptly and the next course was served on time. The chief FA came by my seat and requested to meet him at the business class galley so that we plan for the surprise without attracting too much attention from my wife. He showed me the cake and I bought a gift from the on-board DFS. They brought the cake with tiny lights around it and greeted her. They took plenty of Polaroid photos of us. It was a very memorable flight for both of us.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-06;I flew with my husband on our first Emirates flight on EK434 and EK435 Business Class to Brisbane in November we usually fly BA or Singapore Airlines. I have a few comments to make on the trip first of all the food and drink service was appalling. We had to wait for service were omitted on several occasions and by the time the drink came around the meal was finished. I asked for drinks on a number of occasions and didn't get it even using 2 different male/female cabin crew. I had to get up myself and go to the bar for water on several occasions to find the staff chatting quite happily in the rear oblivious to the alert light I had pressed for assistance . But the most disappointing part of the trip was on the short stopover in Dubai business Lounge on the return flight we expected to have a shower and change. The facilities in Dubai were pathetic there were queues and the turnover in cleaning the shower cubicles was painfully slow. We gave up and continued on our journey without refreshing the Business lounge in Dubai leaves much to be desired it is difficult to find food and the way it is designed could definitely be improved. After British Airways and Singapore Airlines and Qantas we would put it bottom of the list.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-06;"ZRH-DXB-MRU 8/12/13 Business out. Business is is OK but not ""world class"". Staff are attentive but not all the time ! Return in economy. Emirates economy must be one of the most uncomfortable experiences of any airline. 10 seats abreast on a 777 no footrest on the DXB-MRU leg on an old aircraft. Emirates must be one of the most overrated airlines on this site.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2014-01-03;MAD-DXB-NRT-DXB-MAD. All flights served with 777-200LR and 777-300ER. All flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Seats were comfortable enough as to manage some hours sleep and seat pitch adequate it didn't feel that cramped as stated in previous reviews but I guess because I picked the two seat row at the very end of the cabin. All seats I preselected were honoured which was nice. Outbound I did online check-in which worked fine and used the dedicated online check-in counter at Madrid which permitted me to skip the long queues for economy check-in. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working specially on the NRT-DXB leg. All requests were promptly met and you could ask for any kind of drinks and snacks between meals. Food was nice and tasty and portions adequate with several options to choose from I missed breakfast service on MAD-DXB leg though. IFE is the highlighted point of Emirates selection of movies is huge in so many different languages Big high resolution screens and an easy to navigate system. A great experience overall and looking forward to fly with them again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-03;We were a group of 4 that flew AKL-MEL in EK 403 (QF 8761) on Dec 25. It was a very pleasant flight with A-380.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-03;The chauffeur arrived at the hotel on time and helped us to load the luggage and drove us to the airport on a Holden Statesman car. The Emirates Check-in counter is the first counter in the row which is quite convenient. Check-in was swift and we were handed a pre-clearance form along with our boarding passes. We cleared past the baggage screening and emigration in a jiffy. We made our way to the Emirates lounge located right above the departure hall. At the boarding gate they have a separate pathway for First and business class passengers. The FAs welcomed us and guided us to our suites. We were given a pre-take off drink cold towel and Arabic coffee while we waited for rest of the flight to be filled up. A FA came to my suite and introduced himself and gave me a Leather bind menu card and told me that it's not an a la carte dining that night as it was just a four hour flight. Right after the take-off the FA came to take the dinner order. I ordered a Mocktail while waiting for my dinner to be served and it was served promptly with warm nuts. Dinner menu and the choices were pleasing and the food was great. We decided to shower the shower attendant notified us once the shower was ready. The shower was huge and had two types of timeless spa products. A series of shower gel shampoo and moisturiser for relaxation and another series of products to feel refreshed. Other amenities such as razors shaving cream moisturiser cologne and hairdryer were available too. When I returned to my seat the FA came with a detox drink and asked if I wanted the bed to be made. I relaxed at the bar's lounge seats while waiting for bed to be made. When I returned the seat was made flat and all set comfy with mattress duvet and a Godiva chocolate placed on my desk. Overall it was a pleasant flight and great service.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-02;Travelled from Manchester to Lahore. Seats were fairly comfortable staff was very good food was nice toilets were clean. Inflight entertainment was really good I enjoyed watching the movies. The only thing that I didn't like was the delay of up to 20 minutes!;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-02;Economy class from Dubai to Bangkok on A380. The hype was great and the result disappointing the seats were narrow minimum leg room and back of the seat in front of me reclines into my lap. Furthermore I felt that the seats were as cramped as on a charter flight. I will choose an old 747 or 777 for my future travels. I recommend Emirates but not the A380 for tall passengers.;POSITIVE
emirates;2014-01-02;NCL-DXB DXB-BKK-HKG then return on the same flights. Outbound Newcastle to Dubai on 777-300ER. Very good flight - good food good choice ICE entertainment system. Dubai to Hong Kong via Bangkok on A380. Again very good flight - spacious seats and same ICE system as on previous flight. Food reasonably good on this leg of the journey but not as good as first flight. The choice I wanted was unavailable on BKK to HKG leg but the option I was served was nice enough. Return Hong Kong to Dubai via Bangkok A380. Same comments apply about A380 as before. Another good flight except food on this flight. Food on both HKG - BKK and BKK - DXB legs were poor and a massive contrast to the other 3 flights. I experienced the same on a previous Emirates Hong to Dubai flight so this looks a like a localised Hong Kong supplier issue. Dubai to Newcastle on 777-300ER - same as outbound - very good flight and very good food. Both 777-300ER and A380 used same ICE so same inflight entertainment across all flights - loads to choose from and good variety. Touch screen sometimes a little unresponsive on return flights. Cabin crew were generally good and helpful with queries but slow with food service sometimes. Outbound Newcastle departure was delayed due to late incoming flight but other flights were on time or within reason. Transfer in Dubai was easy and hassle free - around 2.5 to 3 hours each time. Overall except for the couple of things mentioned above very impressed with Emirates.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;"EK 201 on 26 November. Return on 24 December. A380 JFK-DXB. Staff were unprofessional. Spent a lot of time chatting in the galley while setting up and serving meals took a long time. In between meals a fasten seat belt sign was on for long spells with no apparent turbulent weather and no one allowed to leave seats even to head to a toilet! No drinks were offered so people had to make their way to the galley. Once a meal is served it takes hours for the trays to be cleared. Passengers walked the trays to the galley themselves! Although the menus are handed out at the start (on one leg it was the wrong one) most often in economy the choices had completely run out and the only comment from the staff was ""we have bad news"". The A380 is too big too crowded too noisy too uncomfortable too irritating and no way to travel on a long haul.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;LHR-HKG via DXB. The seat pitch was surprisingly generous aboard the A380 EK006 from Heathrow to Dubai. The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average. In conclusion the first flight was close to being perfect and the second flight slightly disappointing.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;We flew 4 times with Emirates LGW-DXB-IKA IKA-DXB-LGW. We flew there and back from DXB on a B777-300er it was very quiet. Entertainment was very good with the latest movies. But the flight to IKA from DXB was a let down the entertainment had 20 channels. The food was very nice. I would fly Emirates again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;I flew from Dubai to Perth (return) in Dec 2013. I am very impressed with their quality of customer service and hospitality. This 11 hour flight felt much shorter as I was very comfortable relaxed and entertained by the ICE system. It was also very comfortable to sleep in the very wide seats. USB and mains power supply is provided for charging devices. The highlights of these flights were certainly the crew and the catering which was of a very high quality served to you with steel cutlery. Even economy passengers receive luxuries normally expected for business and first passengers. The crew spoke very many languages and were very approachable. Emirates certainly deserve number 1 airline for the years to come and I wish to fly with them to Australia again.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;Flew from Brisbane to Auckland in business class on an A380. The business class is located on the top deck of the flight. Two sections with 1-2-1 configuration which enables aisle access for all passengers. The single seats on both sides are not aligned with the center seats thus giving you some privacy. The crew warmly greeted and guided us to our seats as we entered the flight. The stewardess introduced herself and told me that she has been assigned to look after for the day's flight and offered the breakfast menu and a pre-take off drink. Each seat had its own selection of drinks that includes a fruit juice two fizzy drink cans still and sparkling water. My wife decided to sleep through the breakfast service but the attendant was concerned and asked if she is feeling ok. The breakfast included fresh fruits freshly squeezed juices toasted muesli and yoghurt. The hot selection served omelettes and sausages or classic French toasts. I went for French toasts with maple syrup and berries. Food was warm and tasty. I ended of my meal with a cappuccino which had Emirates logo dusted on the foam. Nice touch The in-flight entertainment was great with wide variety of movies and dramas. The noise cancelling headphones were good too. The only downside of the center business class seats are leg space. It feels cramped with the leg room extending below the seat in front you.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-30;CMB-SIN in late December. Flight boarded late although had arrived on time from DXB with no explanation and a call 40 mins before anything happened. Relatively comfortable seating on a 777 - the two of us had one of the only rows with only two seats at the very back. Great inflight entertainment but let down by lousy service. They seemed disorganised at best and the meal and drinks took 2.5 hours to arrive. Quality of food not good but given plenty of actually drinkable wine with a smile and apologies. Great arrival experience in SIN - we were out 20 mins after touch-down.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;Flew 6 flights recently in business with Emirates. All on 777 and A380. All flights on time Glasgow to Dubai then to Bangkok to Sydney Melbourne to Singapore then to Dubai and back to Glasgow. Every car arrived on time check in a breeze as was passport control with special pass. Made travelling a pleasure. All personnel were fantastic kind and attentive. Food great as was wine and in every detail Emirates are way beyond the competition. Have read some other reviews which are rather negative. Since we flew so many times I fail to understand the problem. Compared to recent BA experience to New York Emirates are on another level.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;The fleets are new comfy. Flew Narita-Dubai-Munich and Rome-Narita. Always wanted to try A380. The FA's were awful. On one flight the table was dirty. I took 4 flights in total and every time I experienced something horrible. Firstly they didn't give me the bread and I had to ask 2 times for it next I had to wait over 15 mins to receive my main dish. I asked for water that I didn't receive. This is the worst airline service I have experienced so far.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;MUC-MCT via DXB and return. Travelled with my wife and 1.5yr old son. The whole middle front row (4 seats) was just for us. Very comfortable seats pleasant and very helpful flight attendants. A lot of small gifts for the baby and an excellent inflight entertainment. Would definitely fly with them again!;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;Flew from Durban to London Gatwick via Dubai. The first leg of the flight was awful - seat backrest was broken staff could not fix it so they moved us to two different seats which were even worse with a solid lump at the base of the backrests that made it impossible to get comfortable in any position on this long flight. The second leg was great in a two-week old aircraft where we could finally sit in comfort. Unfortunately the Durban-Dubai experience has put me off Emirates.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;"Travelled on a Qantas ticket from Perth Australia to London Gatwick on 19th December. Firstly we could not find an overhead locker to out our 1 piece of luggage in. I asked an attendant to assist us and he stated ""I am not a luggage attendant"". Next it took 2 hours to be offered any form of refreshment and then it was abysmal. I wanted another drink and buzzed for assistance but nobody came. The inflight entertainment was excellent though but all in all a bad flight - Perth to Dubai. Dubai airport - the Emirates lounge was the best I have ever been in and enjoyed the 4 hour lay over. Dubai to Gatwick - slightly better as the staff were a little more customer focused. Food terrible though. Will be travelling back in the new year and am not looking forward to it but this time a stop over in Dubai may make the experience a little better. Never again will I travel on Emirates unless I can afford Business class.";NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-29;Cape Town to Bangkok-departed on time excellent IFE good quality food and drink. Airline staff seemed a bit scarce! But we're mostly engaging and friendly. Transit through Dubai is not a pleasure the airport is one of the most unsettling places to visit. Pity the airline and the airport are so different.;POSITIVE
emirates;2013-12-25;NBO-SIN-NBO. First leg was alright but nothing great. Food service was slow and FA didn't clear trays for ages. Second leg to Singapore on A380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. SIN-DXB was much better but had to keep asking for water/drinks. Don't know why they just don't offer bottles of water like in business class. Flying from Singapore to Perth on Qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate - great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10+ hour flight which Emirates should consider. Last flight was the worst - lots of turbulence so we didn't get any meals. Not Emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. Very thirsty flight again as not enough water/drinks provided. Granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. Cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. Same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. We've been flying Emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to Skywards silver status. We were planning to use Emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines. The only saving grace is the ICE entertainment system which helps you forget the lack of water/drinks the bland food and that tray in front of you.;NEGATIVE
emirates;2013-12-23;"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not. However I think that does not make up for the uncomfortable seating and unfriendly service.";NEGATIVE
