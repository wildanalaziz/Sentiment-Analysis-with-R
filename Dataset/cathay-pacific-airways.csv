cathay-pacific-airways;2018-09-13;" |  Manila to Nagoya via Hong Kong. Haven’t flown with this airline for more than three years. They still offer exceptional service, the cabin is now more spacious with the new aircraft, including its seat legroom. The movies though are quite limited with more dramas which is quite boring.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-09-12;" |  Very short space for the legs, especially in the longest route from Rome to Hong Kong. Horrible food, I’m vegetarian and chose the vegan meal, but all the snacks were full of milk (I’m lactose intolerant). For breakfast we received food that people eat for supper: for me mushroom and lentils, my husband chicken and pasta. In the return journey, in Hong Kong, we had 2 hours of delay to wait for 40 passengers of another flight, and although we had been traveling for 8 hours (Osaka to Hong Kong to Rome) we did not receive any assistance, not even a bottle of water. I think I will not travel again with Cathay.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-09-07;" |  Los Angeles to Okinawa via Hong Kong. My first time to fly Cathay Pacific.  Flight was on time, aircraft was clean. Seating was comfortable. Food was ok, not that fantastic but ok. In flight Entertainment was awesome, lots of choices. Crew were very pleasant. I would fly Cathay Pacific again anytime, however the air fares are quite pricey. There are other airlines with the same service and yet have better air fares. The service agents at Okinawa airport are very helpful. We had to check in excess luggage and the agent helped us pack another box, no hassle. My husband also ordered a Bloody Mary, not enough booze on it, just a lot of tomato juice. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-09-04;" |  New York to Hong Kong. Boarding for economy was rather confusing. While the announcer stated that those with seats in rows 59-72 could board, another agent instructed me and others who had seats in these rows to join a queue that did not move. (Then why did the first agent instruct us to board?) Onboard service was very good, but the meals served fell a little short of the standard one would expect from Cathay. The chicken with mashed potatoes was edible, but uninspiring, while the beef congee was too watered down. Neither meal came with condiments such as salt and pepper. Was that due to cutbacks?  I've flown Cathay many times now, but this flight was not its best.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-31;" |  I booked ""premium"" economy after reviewing the amenities on the website and discussing them with a live agent. (Wait time on the telephone was over 1 hr both times I called!) The flights from JFK - Hong Kong - Siem Reap were fine and the amenities, provided. The flights from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong to JFK were awful. Cathay had a delay which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was promised an upgrade by the gate agent because of the long wait I would have to endure. Upon arrival in Hong Kong, I was denied the upgrade and moved from my window seat to a center seat in the row of 5 seats. After much arguing, they miraculously found a window seat for me. They offered to provide a car in NY to transport me home which, after waiting an hour, they reneged on. However, the most disturbing issue is the advertising of amenities in ""premium"" economy: calf rests at the seat, separate check in and boarding lines and a champagne welcome. None of the amenities were provided. Other than being wider, the seat was no different than flying regular economy. The lines to check in and board were ridiculous and service aboard was awful. Attempts at resolving these issues have been met with a stubborn refusal to acknowledge that they did not provide a ""premium"" experience. Airline has no concern for customer satisfaction. I would never fly them again and certainly, do not recommend spending so much more money for ""premium"" when they don't deliver the product as advertised.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-30;" |  Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Pleased with Gatwick on lunchtime departure. Just check for South Terminal at F Gate, Nice casual boarding [unlike the demeaning line up and wait at Hong Kong]. Cabin staff always welcoming and helpful. Every seat taken - seems a Cathay method. Typically a polite crowd to travel with, majority Chinese, a few Australians and British. I had a low calorie meal on order, so got served maybe 30 minutes ahead of others and by personal delivery. Out of Gatwick the main was delicious fish - very good even if no choice and no menu. Captain message as usual on this airline was English name and well spoken. I rate this airline for having British pilots - gives me confidence in basic skills and also the ability to communicate clearly in the event of difficulties. I told myself the A350 has been in service on this route for over a year, and is used intensively, flying into Gatwick after 11 hours from HK and ready to return at lunchtime. The Cathay themed seats in aqua green are starting to look tired, as also the furniture in the toilets [Try liifting the lid and some stain on the rim]. I require several breaks from sitting as I rarely get to sleep. So I found a small space near the aft toilet where I could pass 30 minutes doing easy knee and toe exercises without being hassled by the crew. [This used to be easier on the 747 with its extra space]. The allocation of toilets was just ok, I counted five located midway and aft. The nice thing about the A350 is that it is not carrying huge numbers, easier to manage. The meals are only average, lacking some extras such as hand towel and block of real cheese. Wine [red or white] comes in a plastic glass - gone is the mini bottle. On boarding, there is no welcome juice or hot towel. The seats feel spacious but are short on supportive cushioning. I actually bolster the seat with the blanket and pillow to support low spine and thighs. The choice of movies is good but falls short of the Qatar Airways range. I enjoy checking the route out over Lowestoft and north to Denmark and the baltic states before an amazing great circle route over Russia through to China. I enjoy the live video cams showing take off and landing. Fortunately daytime on transit in Hong Kong Airport [It is depressingly closed there on night time transits] found a western style breakfast cafe. But kept wishing it was Singapore with its fantastic restaurants. From there Cathay lost points by transferring us to a tired looking B777ER and lining us up like cheap people for 30 minutes before boarding. They could do this much better. Deperture 30 minutes late was not made up. On attempted touch down in Melbourne [shown on video] the pilot aborted landing at the last moment and took off for another attempt. He blamed cross winds for this but I suspect the speed and decline were out of sync. Arrived 4 minutes late turning 11.05 pm. Just one thing to remember, on arrival at Gatwick the Cathay gate is very remote and there are no airport toilets for that sudden need, for maybe 20 minutes hard walking. Impression, love the airline its helpful crew and the route but will have to compare Qatar on price and miss the comfort of Singapore Airport. Disappointed by the B777ER on the Melbourne leg.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-28;" |  Toronto to Colombo via Hong Kong. My flight to Hong Kong from Toronto was cancelled and the next possible flight was given after two days. When assigning accommodation, they only gave us one voucher saying it’s for all four members in my family. But when we reached the hotel, they refused to arrange the necessary rooms for us saying that we have not gotten the proper vouchers. We have been held up at the airport for more than 8hrs being business class passengers they do not give us any priority. The staff is very unprofessional and do not know how to handle a situation as such. Very disappointed in the service and will never use this airline to fly again.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-28; |  Manila to Delhi via Hong Kong. Flight was delayed because of unavoidable reasons at airport but the management of the situation was so unprofessional. I spent more than 15 hrs at manila airport without any intimation of flight orany resting lounge. Inflight they said sorry we don't have anything vegetarian food on board. Again waited for 15 hrs at Hong Kong airport with same amazing facilities. The flight that was scheduled for 15 hrs took almost 40 hrs and rude attitude of staff. Never expected such a unpleasant flying experience.;NEGATIVE

In flight entertainment system was large selection of Movies and entertainment, large selection of duty free and do accept verity Of method check or credit card. Service sequence was well organized. I would recommend Cathay Pacific. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-27;" |  In August 2018, I flew Cathay Pacific from Vancouver to Johannesburg via Hong Kong in Economy Class My return trip used the same route but on Premium Economy. Departure time was delayed, food was average, perhaps because I ordered a special meal (Moslem meal). On both outbound and inbound trips, I was served food with lack of politeness. I had the impression that I was being sort of punished for ordering a special meal: I was once denied bread, my claim for coffee many times ignored. However, I refrained from complaining.  Seats were fair on Economy and very good on Premium Economy. No particular complaint over seats.  Inflight entertainment was excellent. Being a Marco Polo Green member didn’t really give me the kind of treatment I was expecting. Above all I was struck by the rudeness of stewardess I dealt with on both outbound and inbound flights.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-25;" |  Auckland to Gatwick return via Hong Kong and really enjoyed my experience. The crew knew how to treat customers remembering their names. It took two flights to get to London and two flights to return home and only one flight I felt uncomfortable, but it was an older plane. I loved that each plane that we were on had charging points for electronics. Would definitely fly long haul with them again.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-17;" |  Bangkok to Vancouver via Hong Kong. On-board experience was very good. The new economy seat was well designed. I love the individual storage of the new eco seat. The small hard pocket under the display for smartphone and power bank. There also an electric socket for plug-in the laptop for fast charging via wall charge adapter. Entertainment system was good. It was not excellent but enough. Foods were good for both of dinner and breakfast. Crews were helpful and nice. Alert and ready for service all the time. Cathay's crews are energetic and helpful. Transit via Hong Kong airport is the perfect choice,  easy, smooth and convenient. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-10;" | Sydney to Hong Kong. Very enjoyable experience flying with Cathay Pacific, I fly often with other airlines and can say that Cathay economy is superior to many other airlines flying this route. There is surprisingly plenty of legroom in economy class and seats are quite decent and comfortable with USB charging and places to put your things. The check-in process in Sydney was fast and staff were friendly, although the booking class I booked did not entitle me to pre-book seats at time of purchasing flights, I was able to choose seats a couple of days before when on-line check in opened. On board staff were also friendly and efficient, food served was tasty and there were a few options to choose from and staff went through the aisles often enough to provide drinks when needed. The only downside (if any) was a slightly limited offering of movies and TV shows on the inflight entertainment. This was the first leg of four with Cathay Pacific and looking forward to flying with them again.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-10;" |  Sydney to Hong Kong. I spent just 20% more for premium economy compare to a basic economy ticket. Compare to economy the airline offered better seats, food and service. There was a dedicated check in counter for premium passengers. Seats can recline more and the meal was more better than the economy product. Also, a small amenity kit was also available. However, I don’t like the lighting in the 777 which makes the cabin look a bit worn out.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-09;" | Comfortable and very easy flight from Bangkok to Hong Kong in the new Airbus 350-900 of Cathay Pacific. Crew and food has the same high and outstanding standard one gets form Cathay Pacific in older Jets like the 777. In addition the Airbus 350 has more new gadgets then the ""old"" 777 and has WiFi etc. The seats look similar to the one in the Boeing aircraft, but the bed seems less comfortable and more tight then the old ones. Similar experiences with Thai and Qatar Airways where the Dreamliner has more comfort for the passenger then the Airbus 350.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-09;" | Smooth and easy flight from Zurich to Hong Kong in the 777 ER without any problem but some nice surprises. The seat (single seats at the window) is very comfortable and the bed is very long and wide as well. The food is fresh with a lot of quality and has an interesting mix of Western and Chinese Food. The Entertainment system has a lot of choices and a variety of western and Asian movies and music, culture, etc. One positive surprise is the always friendly and very competent airline crew. The staff in charge addressed me by name, which is a very personal touch. The crew does not mind to go the extra mile for the passenger, and always with a smile. (What a difference to Emirates, where the staff even in First cannot remember one's name.) The 777 has an airy feeling and a lot of space. some of the bathrooms are very spacious, and all of them are aways clean, they must be cleaned regularly by staff. The business class product of Cathay is for years now one of the best in the industry, if not the best. This outstanding business class product is miles above the one of their competitors from the Middle East such as Emirates or Qatar Airways.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-09; |  Hong Kong to Sydney. The aircraft for this flight was the new ten across seating. I have flown on a number of airlines with 777 with ten across but none were as dire as Cathay Pacific. It was by far the worst seat I have experienced on a long haul flight (even by 777 ten across standards it is tight). The leg room is poor as well and the seat looks really cheap as well. I have to say no low cost carrier treats it's passengers with the contempt Cathay Pacific does. I can't think of any airline out of Sydney who has seats even remotely as cramped.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-08;" |  Hong Kong to Adelaide. The flight was on time and smooth. The seat was spacious which I can stretch my leg fully though I am 6 feet tall. Really appreciate the meal service which provides a nice Thai style salad as the appetiser with a Malay curry chicken as main. Dessert was impressive, with cheese cakes and chocolate bars. Amenities Kit was also provided with branded body care products. Only pain point was the lacking of internet connectivity.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-08-04;" |  I recently flew Dubai to Auckland via Hong Kong return and was very disappointed with the service. Traveling long haul, I figured it would be worth the extra money to go with a good airline so paid significantly more than competing airlines. Not so! The airline ran out of meals (except for fish) so gave me and a number of other guests a pot noodle snack. They also ran out of chicken and vegetarian meals on the first leg of the trip, even though we were seated in the middle rather than towards the back of the plane. Very poor planning and organization it seems since this seems to be a consistent issue. Although the food was pretty decent to be fair. My bag didn’t make the second leg of the journey despite a 15 hour layover (plenty of time). I’d been in the same clothes for 2 days and was given nothing, not even a toothbrush. I literally had the clothes on my back and travelling from 45 degrees celcius to 12 degrees, I was very, very cold! On the return journey, my husband wasn’t travelling due to a sudden death in the family. Having paid over US $3000 for the flight, I figured at least I’d have an empty seat beside me. I explained this upon check in and was told that they would be re-selling the seat which they did. I hadn’t given due notice to the cancellation due to the circumstance so I wouldn’t be getting any refund or compensation. They didn’t even upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business and there were empty seats. The customer service was astoundingly poor. “Please” and “thank you” we’re rarely reciprocated. When handing out meals, “coming through, coming through, coming through” was belted out and the attendants barged through the aisle. Moral of the story, you don’t always get what you pay for. The point of this review. choose a cheaper airline! I’ve travelled on budget airlines that offer a far superior service and have much better customer service. This is not the rant of someone who expects a stellar service and everything to be pristine. The poor service was consistent on the 4 flights I’ve taken in the last couple of weeks with Cathay Pacific. As a frequent flyer (I’ve flown to a number of countries across 5 continents in the last year just to give some idea), this really is one of the poorest quality airlines I’ve ever flown with and will be avoiding this airline at all cost in the future.";NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-31;" |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Its been many years since I flew Cathay Pacific Economy. I was a Diamond member back in the 1980's. The journey was on time. However plane was dirty, food was average to say the least. But my biggest complaint, is no leg room, this plane had previously flown in to Hong Kong from Sydney. As a medical professional the leg room supplied is below safe levels, 2 hours was uncomfortable, 9 hrs and it would have killed me. This is supposed to be a 5 star airline, act like it, 31 or 32 inch pitch is not enough. It truly was cattle class.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-29;" |  Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh Cith via Hong Kong, returning Hanoi to Gatwick via Hong Kong. Fast check-in in London and Hanoi, helpful ground staff, rapid boarding, and very easy transits at HKG, which is a wonderful airport to use. The flights were on time, and were on A350s (except Hanoi-Hong Kong, which was an A330) which is a fantastic aircraft to fly in - quiet, well pressurised, sensitively lit, spacious, comfortable seats. I think only the B787 is in the same league as the A350 for passenger comfort in economy. In-flight entertainment was excellent, with a lot of new release films to choose from. I enjoyed the camera views available on the A350. In-flight food was good but nothing to write home about, although the snack bar at the back of the plane was excellent. Cabin crew were mostly friendly. The one negative was being forced to shut the window blinds after lunch on the LGW-HKG leg - departure was at 11.15am so I had no desire to sleep or be surrounded by darkness from about 2pm! Would definitely use Cathay again, but would be nice to see them use the A350 on routes to LHR, as LGW isn't the nicest airport (I doubt this will happen any time soon though due to the lack of first class on the A350).";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-23;" |  Hong Kong to Singapore. Unfortunately took this Cathay Pacific flight in Jan 2018 from HKG to SIN during midnight, very sad news was the last minute aircraft changes due to NO reason. From A350 1x2x1 seat configurations to B777 2x3x2 seat configurations, the cabin was so narrow, very similar to economy class seats. I missed out my meal service, I understand passengers may sleep during the midnight flight, but there was no one asking about if I am okay to wake up during the meal service, after I woke up, there was no on asking if I want have some meal before the flight landed.  Will not take Cathay Pacific flight again.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-22;" |  San Francisco to Hyderabad via Via Hong Kong, we had a slight delay but they apologized nicely and when we got onboard CX879 to Hong Kong the hospitality got even nicer with the flight attendants stowed your luggage in the overhead compartments. What a nice airline.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-21;" |  Hong Kong to Bangkok. I reckon for the past 8 flights I’ve been on with them this year, they have been delayed ridiculously (two hours). Other airlines are not affected as much it seems. The advertisement of duty free sales in the inflight entertainment system is very annoying as well as unnecessary PA announcements such as that they’re collecting donations for unicef. Their method of contacting customers regarding ticket bookings is terrible too. I was once called and sent a very vague email not mentioning the reason for contacting me. I only realised a couple of hours before a supposedly booked flight that the credit card payment didn’t go through and that was what they were calling about. Would have been nice to have mentioned it as on the email instead of saying “we tried to call you please reply when you are free” - which I did reply ASAP with no follow up. Changing flights from overseas is a problem too if you enter your asiamiles number when calling in as it directs you to an office which cannot handle ticketing! They told me to call again and not enter my number - silly.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-19;" |  Sydney to Tel-Aviv via Hong Kong. Extremely disappointing trip. The return leg involved a side trip to Osaka, flying back via Tokyo. Aside from cramped and uncomfortable seats, I was surprised at how truly awful the food was. This was consistent across all six flights. In flight service was mixed - ranging from not very good to ok. The overall experience was the feeling that I was on a budget airline. Upgraded to premium economy on two of the long haul legs of the trip. While the seat was a lot more comfortable, the food was the same - close to inedible. I don't know why, but I expected more of Cathay. Unlikely to fly with them again.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-15; | This is my second time to take Cathay Pacific flying from Manila to San Diego via Hong Kong. The food served was really bad with an after taste not to mention the fact that the flight was 2.5 hrs delayed. We were held inside the aircraft for 2hrs and the other 30mins was due to late boarding. I wont take Cathay Pacific anymore. The only positive thing is their legroom which is more spacious than other airlines.;NEGATIVE

Onboard, the seating looks old but still comfortable. The IFE had a lot of choices. We were served with a cold sandwich on a very early flight. The flight attendants were attentive but doesn’t feel friendly. Hong Kong to Manila, the aircraft is a B777. The cabin looked stunning as the plane was new. The IFE was very nice, same contents as the first flight but the system is much easier to operate. The seats are comfotable too. We were served with a warm cheese and bacon roll for breakfast. The FAs are attentive and looked enthusiastic to work. Both flights has no wifi.";POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2018-07-07; |  Hong Kong to Zurich. Amazing that Cathay cares so little about their business class passengers that they on a 12 hours night flight could not speed up their first leg connecting flight (of 3 hours) by 10 min or delay their connecting flight by 10 min and catch up over the following 12 hours. Instead they bumped 2 business class passengers and sent us over Manchester and then Manchester to Zurich. Our advice - don’t fly Cathay if you can at all avoid it - that is the only way we as passengers can ensure they care in the future.;NEGATIVE

The seat product is spacious, and it provides a reasonable amount of privacy, which is what business class travellers need. The portion of the food was acceptable and snacks were also included, so passengers would not get hungry during the journey. I visited lounge C at London Heathrow Airport, and it is an amazing lounge. The ambience and environment provided a lot of comfort, and the choice of food tended towards the Hong Kong and Asian Style, which were very pleasing to see in a high reputation airline.

So I arrived early at the airport, and the check-in lines were divided by classes like all airlines do. Except there was service at the first class, premium economy, but no one was the economy counter! Finally after the premium economy were all served, the counter called for the economy customers. The man at the counter had no smile, and looked impatient, and just asked me to put up my luggage and printed out the tickets for me. (Did not even ask me which seats I prefer, if I could check in online I would've picked my own seat). Then came an awkward moment of silence where we stood staring at each other. Then I asked, is that all? He finally spoke and said yes, you will be boarding at gate XX. He wasn't rude, but just didn't feel the friendliness that I was expecting.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-06-29;" |  Vancouver to Hong Kong. Very bad experience with the Inflight Service!. I travelled with my husband and 8 month old daughter from Vancouver to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific for almost 12 hours. In the middle of the long flight, a turbulence occurred and the seatbelt sign came on. So I grabbed my baby and held her on my lap, then put on my seatbelt as i could not find the baby seatbelt that the flight attendants have provided earlier. One of the flight attendants came to check on us if our seatbelts were buckled, and asked me if they offered the baby seatbelt, to which i said yes, but i could not find it so i will just look for it later after the turbulence. FA then freaked out and raised her voice, saying “what do you mean you can’t find it? You have to find it now!” Then turned on the overhead light, disregarding my sleeping baby, then shoved my right shoulder away from the back of my seat so she can take a look and try to find the baby seatbelt. Knowing that she won’t stop harassing me and my baby, I woke my husband and asked for his help. When he saw how the FA was treating me and my baby, even he got surprised and blurted out “whoa, whoa, whoa! I’ll take care of them myself.” To which the FA said she just did not want to wake the baby. A totally contradicting statement to what she was doing just minutes ago. I filed a complaint to their Customer Relations Department and got a response through email saying that they “understand how annoying the situation must have been for me” and that they “have shared my letter with the Inflight Services Manager so that they can follow up with the staff members in question”.  They do not care about the experience of their customers and they have rude Flight Attendants.";NEGATIVE

The seat legroom and width on B777 and A330 are ample while on the A320 (3-3 configuration) is quite squeezed. The HKG-MNL flight is 3-4-3 configuration but at the back where 78A is located has 2-4-2 configuration. 78A might be the last choice for most people but I highly recommend it as it has more space compared to other seats in the economy section. Since the MNL-HKG-MNL is just a short flight, onyl refreshments was served. Coffee is available upon request. For the HKG-CTU-HKG, breakfast is served. The food is good. Storage for coats or jacket is also available and the FA's are willing to assist. IFE selection is enough for a short flight. The flying time is not enough actually to finish one movie.

The flight was full but boarding process was organised and efficient and  passengers were on board in 40 minutes. Cabin crew were very friendly and welcoming. As with my previous trip from LHR, they were very attentive and consistent. The plane was rather old but the cabin was immaculate and clean!

Although me and my other half are both oneworld Sapphire (BA Silver), we were invited and escorted to Fast Track security which is only available for oneworld Emerald members. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Heathrow Terminal 3 was phenomenal. Facilities were great with Aesop products in the showers and bathrooms. The lounge wasn't very crowded. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the lounge was very clean. Boarding process was very efficient. Upon boarding, the cabin crew were warm and friendly. One of the first things I have noticed on boarding the aircraft was how the cabin was clean. At our seats, there was headphones, pillow and blanket. No overnight or amenity kits on the seats but these can be requested from the cabin crew. The seat was very wide, outstanding IFE with great selections of movies and TV prorammes and albums. As soon as the seatbelt sign was off, the cabin crew started the drinks service, given a bag of peanuts and full sized can drinks which is more than sufficient compared to other airlines. Main meal service portion was great, Movenpick Ice Cream handed out and the cabin crew again offered us drinks. The food served on CX is the best I have had on a long haul flight. The cabin crew came along with trays of drink every hour and a self service drinks and snack 'bar' was set up in the galley with plenty of options. Cup noodles were offered half way through the flight with another drinks service. Breakfast was served prior to landing which again is the best I have had on a long haul flight - I chose the chinese option which was amazing. Overall, Cathay Pacific truly deserves its 5 star rating from Skytrax. Nothing went wrong on this flight and I personally don't think Cathay Pacific has a lot to improve on - perhaps Wi-Fi on the plane and upgraded IFE which is already on the way. The cabin crew were very friendly, polite and professional, ensuring lavatories were kept clean, offering drinks and responding to passenger needs promptly.";POSITIVE

I've been flying with Cathay Pacific ever since they started offering non-stop flights to Zurich (2015) and have experienced their economy, premium economy and business classes. The seats are comfortable I like the new A350. That's it. If you're tall, you won't like the business class seats as the space for the foot area narrows significantly. The business class food is also subpar compared to other airlines. The food in all classes is not good in general. Further, the variety of (good) movie options went down significantly. There are barely any new movies and more of classics, the ones you have most likely seen already. Check out the June 2018 options if you can. Ferdinand is probably your best choice. What's the absolute worst, though, is the arrogance and unfriendliness of staff that I've experienced on numerous occasions, particularly of the floor staff. They also don't seem to coordinate/communicate between locations and are often not properly trained about giving customers the correct information. Wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.";NEGATIVE

There were three main meal options, I chose the Chicken with potatoes, which was very nice, dessert included a nice Movenpick ice cream. The IFE on was new and diverse, new movies and a very big screen. Free wifi was also included but was very slow and did not work. We landed in Melbourne on time.

cathay-pacific-airways;2018-06-10;" |  Booked last minute as this is the cheapest flight I could find out of NYC to my home country Philippines. I chose CRK as I would not want to trouble myself getting out of MNL Airport. Last time I flew CX was in 2009 to RUH. The service and food then was great so I trusted that it would be the same or better. Flight date is 08 June. Check in was brief, pleasant. Felt at home as there were a lot Filipino staff in EWR. Airplane is new, legroom was good. In flight entertainment was great! This is a 15+ hour flight and we had 2 meals and snacks in between. I had dinner around 8 PM. We flew out 1:55 AM. Most of the restaurants near the gates were closed and besides food the airport was expensive. After supper (which was very good. I had beef, fried rice and veggies) I was still hungry. The menu said that they offer cup noodles upon request. The FA gave me another entree! As really am not able to sleep during flights, I walk around. I went to the galley at the back of the plane and they have snacks. Few hours passed, I went to the back and asked for toothbrush. I noticed that they do not provided amenity kits unless you asked. I asked for socks at the beginning of the flight. I think I asked both of these from the team lead FA. She is not smiling, very serious and does not even respond back after saying thank you. I had a feeling that she does not like serving Filipinos because she was from Hong Kong. There was an Indian flight attendant serving my area and I thought it was nice for CX to have diversity in their crew. But I was really disappointed the way this team lead FA treated me. I have read a few reviews and it feels very tight. I guess I have gotten used to western airlines that offer small chats. So snack time came and they were serving cup noodles. I am hungry so I requested for one. The FA was apologetic and told me I can only have one and I did have mine already. But other people are not even having a snack. They served breakfast late.30 mins before landing they are still serving breakfast. Overall I did not enjoy this leg of the flight. Transferred to Satellite terminal in HK. It was packed flight. Flight was delayed. Baggage was delayed. And snack was served on a paper bag. Crackers, candy and water. Not even coffee. CX went below my expectations. I guess airline services across the board is getting worse.";NEGATIVE

The sense of efficiency comes across from all the interaction I have had with their staff, in particular, the cabin crew who always seem to be dashing off to accomplish some urgent tasks. The seats of the plane I was on seem dated but otherwise quite comfortable. The inflight entertainment was good, with lots available to distract me for the duration of the flight.

Meal was served with 3 choices in dinner with a movenpick ice cream, while the breakfast was served with both English and Chinese styles. The plane was very quiet and it arrived on time.

We ran due to lack of a proper update and still ended up missing our flight. They put us on the next flight which was leaving 9hrs later and they didn't give us any compensation. The only thing we received was one HK$75 per person, which was not even enough to buy a meal deal at the airport.";NEGATIVE

It was on an A330 -300 which is one of my favourite aircraft. Reasonably quiet, easy to get on and off and very comfortable to ride in. CX has always had a good product on both the hard, aircraft, side and then the soft skills. Typically Asian service, efficient and with a smile. The IFE was good with plenty of choice for a mid haul of 9 hours. I declined the breakfast service (congee, fruit or eggs) as 4 am is a bit rich and early for my palate. The fact that there was little to say about this leg is a testament to the CX product.";POSITIVE

I will never fly with them again. I booked and paid in May 2017 for a Premium Economy flight to Sydney.  I was flying out to Australia on 26th September 2017 and returning 25th April 2018. At 73 years of age and travelling alone, I thought that I would treat myself and incur the extra expense of being able to book my seats in advance. However when my date for return to the UK came around I was shocked to find when using online check-in the day before travel that my previously booked window seat on the 9.5 hour leg from Sydney to Hong Kong had been allocated to somebody else. I had been bumped to an aisle seat at the back of the cabin and just a couple of feet from the economy class cabin. I queried this at Sydney airport on my departure day. They were unwilling to do anything about it. I asked the lady in my previously booked seat, how she got it. She had booked 9 months after me and was not related to the person sitting next to her, so it was obviously a Cathay malfunction. At no stage did I receive any notification of the seat change. I complained to Cathay Pacific and eventually got the promise of 100USD compensation. Still waiting. That is under 4% of the ticket price. This was a terrible experience and I will not be risking a repeat of it. My advice is to avoid Cathay Pacific.";NEGATIVE

No matter which gate is your flight going to be, there is always one good lounge next to that area. I love the international business class of CX. Their seats are very comfortable with good entertainment system. However, their food is really getting worse and worse in the last few years. It is really sad to see such a good airline to be ruined by providing bad quality of food. Compare with the new CX business class of its A350 plane. A330 is a bit old, but still, in good quality compared with most of the other airlines. The other problem of CX is almost all of their flights are delayed. My flight was delayed for almost an hour. Since one flight is delayed, all other flight of the day will be delayed.";POSITIVE

There was no zoned boarding procedure for a B777 economy class, which was somehow unbelievable, so you might imagine the long queue at the gate which extended further to two adjacent boarding gates. The in-flight experience was fine: meals were served a bit slowly probably due to large numbers of customised meal choice. Cabin crew were often busy rushing back and forth to deliver customised meals first before serving the rest ordinary ones. Entertainment content was very up-to-date and contained much to choose from. Pre-landing information was accurate and clear.";POSITIVE

Food and service excellent. Punctuality spot on. Would definitely fly with them again, All the equipment worked on the return flights and connections seamless. I use a wheelchair in airports and stations. This worked extremely well. Return journey was seamless and punctual. We agreed to swap seats with a family who we we separated due a last minute change of aircraft, we thought nothing of this. The new seats suited us better.

IFE had great options and was very responsive, new releases included some movies which are still in cinema. The 777-300ER was quite new with amazing legroom. Picking a red eye flight with Cathay Pacific isn't that bad because they provide you with the amenities that you need, even though you have to request for the toothbrush and hairbrush.

Snacks were complementary, you can have snacks anytime throughout the flight. The inflight entertainment system of Cathay is the best for me because of its content, I pushed the flight attendant button for the Snacks, the FA was already in my row, after a second I pushed the button.

Cabin design excellent with spacious overhead lockers, decent sized toilets (no dedicated PE one but it didn't matter) and best of all vastly improved PE seating, both more comfortable and better leg-room than the 777, at least it felt that way. More 350s please! The one downside on this trip is that they served us economy class food for lunch and it was rubbish. Never complained about PE food before (never had to) but this time I am. One additional point to note is that the back row of PE on both sides overlaps with the economy cabin so be advised.";POSITIVE

It lasts up to 21.30 hours. Nevertheless it has been my best ever flight in my 26 years of flying. I arrived in Hong Kong as refreshed as I left US East Coast. The cabin on this B777 certainly can't compete with rivals in terms of innovation and technology. But Cathay offer room for privacy, a comfortable bed and a personalized service. For someone who is looking for as much rest as possible this is certainly a good option. On the first leg to Vancouver I skipped dinner because I felt sleepy. Soon after take-off my bed was prepared and I only woke up 30 minutes before landing into Vancouver. I was served the requested cake from the dinner menu and had a quick cup of tea. The best entertainment on board for me was actually watching the ground-staff cleaning, re-catering and preparing the aircraft during the stop in Vancouver for the flight to Hong Kong. Soon after take-off I slept for another five hours. Foodwise I was impressed by the fact that some offerings were freshly prepared such as jasmine rice, toast and scrambled eggs. Dining on-demand is a plus when one tries to overcome jetlag. I was able to start with breakfast instead of dinner options and finish off with dinner options before the early morning landing. The crew and the crew-passenger-ratio on this flight and in this cabin were outstanding. I was well fed and well looked after by two senior crew members and the inflight manager. They made me feel like at home and by wearing pyjamas I actually felt like at home on a lazy Sunday morning, having brunch in bed, reading the papers and looking out of the window, watching the sunrise.";POSITIVE

As an anxious flyer this airline definitely is worth avoiding. Uncompromising. Dispassionate and rude. After being lied to several times by the airline with what would be a reasonable request I highly recommend taking another airline. In terms of feedback and dispute resolution.

To start with Hong Kong being a relatively new airport we thought would be good - nothing but plastic seats to sit on and very large windows (30ft high at a guess) which acted like cold air waterfalls. We were cold and there was no heating we could detect. Cold on the plane as well - we travelled all the way back with our winter coats on. Then came the message that they did not have sufficient evening meals on board so sitting at the rear of the plane we had a breakfast instead - which was not good shall we say. At breakfast time we declined the meal (once was enough) and waited until we arrived at Manchester for some food. I have travelled with Cathay Pacific before when I was working and had business class seats and had no complaints. CP have in my estimation gone way back in standard.

We were expecting good quality, fresh and well equipped planes on our trip to and from Australia. Instead we found ourselves in old, obsolete, and dirty planes with super old seats and monitors. What was most appaling though was the fact than on both our trips the pillows provided appeared used. On the way to Australia the pillow was covered in someone's hair, on the way back it was dirty with powder or foundation. My husband's pillows had some dark spots and smelled. Upon complaining the staff was very apologetic but not surprised at either of the occasions.

The 350 is a great aircraft, and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of these-they're quiet, spacious, and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics (they fold in-and out) the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand, and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesn't need another glowing review-it was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly, trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch, though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing, the volume is adequate without being turned up too high-it helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude.

I believe ""tomato concasse"" would normally be crushed tomatoes. No sign of that. The menu option was, Stir fried egg noodles with chicken, vegetables and 2 dumplings. However the amount of chicken and vegetables could be held on one tablespoon. It was essentially just stir fried noodles. The dumplings were small but good. I understand I was flying economy and wasn't expecting Haute Cuisine, however using fancy words to describe something so substandard is just wrong and leads to disappointment when other menu options could have been chosen. The wine was nice but one small glass was less than some other airlines serve. Other aspects of the trip were really good including the plane and service etc. However it would have been good to be able to select a seat and not have one automatically allocated as someone taller than 6 foot could be uncomfortable in a 78 cm pitched seat.";POSITIVE

Gave it to me, walk away anddid not offer me any drink at all! I was totally shocked! No smile, screw members are to busy chit chat instead of serving it’s customers. They charge me cancellation fees for tickets purchased andcancel within 24hrs! Called customer service! Took them 1hr plus to answer my call! There are other airlines on my business route that treat customer much much better than Cathay! I did prefer them as #1 choice because of shortening flight time, but now on!

Staff informed me of a possible seat upgrade and asked for my seat preference if upgraded. Cathay's lounge in Bangkok was fairly chaotic, as a British Airways flight was delayed and hence resulted in a higher volume of number of people. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a 3-class A330-300. The flight was full and quick, flying time was 2 hrs 9 minutes instead of usual 2 hrs 30-45 minutes. Crew were mostly Thai and were extremely pleasant over meal service, showing Thai hospitality and Cathay's core value. Otherwise, flight was uneventful and the plane arrived Hong Kong earlier than scheduled. I had booked an itinerary that would require an overnight layover in Hong Kong. Heading to the lounge, the staff was welcoming and informed me the lounge would close at 12.30am. I visited 3 lounges and I found the Pier to be the most suitable for a nap as there is a nap area. I returned to the lounge at 5.30am, when it reopened, prior to my flight to Toronto. Hong Kong to Toronto on CX828. Once again a full flight in Economy and I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the flight. Seat next to me was empty. Amenity kits, headphones, a blanket and a pillow was placed at the seat prior to boarding. Seat provided extra legroom that would normally be found on bulkhead Economy seats. The seat storage was adequate and the focus on details was truly amazing. Tray table was easy to operate and was of a good size to fit a laptop. Flight departed Hong Kong slightly late but arrived Toronto half an hour ahead of schedule. The crew on this flight were pleasant, offering several round of drinks throughout the flight. However, despite all the positives, the biggest let down on this trip was catering. Especially on the Premium Economy sector, I chose the western option for lunch and the mashed potatoes were soggy and grainy. Dinner was standard, but for the most part, meal was similar to that of Economy's. Although the plus is getting actual metal cutlery instead of plastic ones. Overall, an average experience. I would still fly with them, given their flexibility and frequency of flights I have mentioned in my previous reviews.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-02-26;" | First time flying Business Class on the A350-900. Same herring bone layout as the B777, which I think is the best layout as all the seats have aisle access and means you're not having to step over people to get out of your seat. The seat in design terms is pretty much the same as the old product, which is a great, why change something if it ain't broke, but obviously with a better resolution screen, updated handset, and a couple more storage holes. However, my only gripe about the A350 is that the headphone sockets now only takes a 2 pin adaptor of which strangely one is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm. Hence my Bose QC35 no longer work - first world problems right? Cathay or Airbus please work with Bose to sort this out! I noted on this flight that the crew did not give out the full evening meal i.e. missed out dessert and cheese board. Plus the crew weren't as attentive or proactive as expected from Cathay which was a first for me as I normally praise Cathay staff.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-02-26;" | I have always flown Cathay (B777) from London Heathrow, mainly because of Cathay's superb lounge in T3. However this time I thought I'd try out Cathay's Premium Economy Class on their A350-900 from London Gatwick. While at Gatwick's South terminal and being a One World Sapphire member I got to use BA's lounge and the First Class lounge at that! To be honest I was really disappointed and not a patch on even Cathay's business lounge at Heathrow. Moving onto the flight. The new premium economy was superb! The new darker colour scheme made the seat feel cosier, modern and sleek. The seat was comfy, in fact it was the first time I've actually had a proper sleep on a premium economy seat. The noise levels are definitely lower than the B777 and certainly noticed my skin and throat didn't feel dry with the new air filteration system. The updated IFE with a wider screen than the B777 is probably one of the best on any airline and, in my opinion, far better than compared to Emirates. It was easier to navigate through and just worked (a month before, I took a return Emirates A380 flight from LGW to Dubai and on both legs the IFE stopped working!). My main gripe with the new A350 is that the headphone sockets now only take a 2 pin adaptor where one pin is 2.5mm and the other 3.5mm - hence my Bose QC35's adaptor no longer fits which was really annoying. I even enquired with Bose to see if they had a suitable adaptor which they didn't - so really bummed about that - if Cathay can provide a suitable adaptor I'd be really happy! I really shouldn't complain about the food on Cathay anymore after sampling the awful food on Emirates. Staff were, as you'd expect from Cathay, to be professional and courteous. All-in-all an enjoyable flight.";POSITIVE

When I board the aircraft, the crew has already been so annoyed by people moving around that they used a relatively unfriendly tone asking passengers to get settled down. Fortunately, their attitude improved after departure. The inflight food has a god taste, and the cup noodles provided between meals is hot enough. However as this a 16-hour flight, the crew provided a second meal at the middle of the flight, in the addition that many passengers have consumed their cup noodles before the second meal. This results in a poorer feedback of inflight food. The airline should consider providing a lighter meal or snacks at the middle of the flight. The inflight entertainment is ordinary. Generally the flight has been delayed by 1 hour and no apology has been made. ";POSITIVE

In addition, there's wifi service on the A350, which may cost you $20 for whole flight, it's really useful when you want to keep in touch with your family even above the clouds! As its introduction said, this aircraft is very quiet that you can rarely hear the noise. Perfect design of the seats made me have a sweet dream on a tired long haul flight.

Cathay is easy to deal with at the airport - no hassles with electronic boarding passes, lounges work fine, boarding process very smooth. The experience on the flight is excellent as well - good crew, decent food, excellent seats. There is nothing in particular to complain about - the seats may not be as wide as Singapore, the crew may not be as attentive as I have found on China Southern, the plane may be older than others - but this is a very solid airline with an excellent product. From Hong Kong to Singapore the plane used was also a 777-300 but with a denser short-haul configuration in business. The seats did not go flat or even angle flat but the design is more modern than traditional business bucket seats.

Movie selection is diverse and kept me occupied for the 15-hour flight. Catering was consistent, flavours not bad. However, since the flight left Toronto in the afternoon, lunch was served right after takeoff, but dinner was then served midway through the flight instead of prior to arrival, which is slightly odd. None the less, flight departed Toronto and arrived Hong Kong ahead of schedule. Hong Kong to Bangkok on a 2-class A330. Contrary to the Toronto flight, this flight was full. Pushback in Hong Kong was on time, but it took such a long time to receive clearance for takeoff from HKG that the flight arrived Bangkok 20 minutes late. Not the airline's fault. Deplaning in Bangkok was by stairs, which was odd for a CX flight. Crew were mostly Thai and were extremely pleasant throughout the 2.40hrs flight. Bags were quick to arrive. Overall, standard service and I look forward to using their service again.";POSITIVE

I reached Delhi airport at around 10 pm so I had to stay hungry the whole night. Furthermore, no socks, toothbrush, or eye cover for sleep were provided. Lastly, this airlines cabin crew are the rudest crew I have ever come across, keeping in mind I have travelled to over 15 countries. They focus mostly on business class passengers. I think Cathay Pacific is a hyped up airline. ";NEGATIVE

Food is fair for business class. The worst part of the experience is the surly unfriendly attitude from the flight attendant crew. This is the second time I have flown Cathay Pacific and both times have received unfriendly service. When I went to the bathroom while the seat belt sign was on, I was told to ""go sit down"" like a child being scolded, even though there is no turbulence and at least 4 other customers had gone to the bathroom immediately before me with no hassle. I had to insist that I had to use the toilet before the flight attendant would let me pass. The service, by contrast, on my flight in the other direction via Singapore Airlines was perfection, the reason why they are consistently at the top of the list.

One selects a particular seat for a reason and it is rather odd they ignored my partner as we were seated behind each other. The cabin crew hardly smiled and food from a supermarket would be better than what was served. A starter of dinner before landing was a plate of cut fruit. This in incredibly mean. The main (confit of duck) was as cold as ice. Cathay is going through a hard time but by serving supermarket type food they are telling loyal customer like me to look elsewhere.

My premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 17:15, to Perth via Hong Kong, but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. The people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights, even other airlines. I waited for more than two hours in the queue, eventually to be told that there were two options available . I could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight, with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original, resulting in a full day delay. My other option was to fly another airline, to Sydney via Singapore, with a lengthy wait there until a connection to Perth, the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. No upgrades were offered, despite those delays and the inconvenience. I asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only, on the first option. That, apparently, is the very best they could do for me. During the conversation I was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if I thought I could do better, told that I should appreciate that they hadn't deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation - as though I was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances. I won't be flying with them again after this trip And I'll be spreading the word around our Australia-based business - not because they had a problem with my flight but because their response to it was haphazard and unsatisfactory.";NEGATIVE

Cathay Pacific provide us only a basic support as hotel accomodation and cheap dinner + breakfast voucher. With a such big delay and with the information reported above, a European company by law would have provide to the passengers also a relevant cash compensation.

His seat did not stay in position so he braced his leg against the seat in front to maintain his seat in recline. I am 155cms in height and his seat was pressing into my knees.

She then suggested that I move seat which I was more than happy to do. I asked if she could please help me move my things and she made a comment that I was not showing respect. She seemed to think that helping me move my things was beneath her. She then called upon the other stewardess to help me move. When I moved seat, the passenger in front of my reclined, I kept my book in the pocket and still had much more room than I originally had, which suggests to me that the seat in front was in fact broken to be able to recline that much.

For a change, I did not feel sore or have a backache after the almost 15 hour flight to HKG. I was even able to get some sleep here and there- a first for me. Legroom is also decent. The seat back pocket issue is a real thing - which others have brought up. It didn't bother me as much after a while. The crew on both the flights from and to Newark, seemed to have a problem with the cabin lighting. There were occasions when the cabin was pitch dark, it would suddenly get super bright and then go back down to dim - for no reason. Service was generally efficient, the crew were always present throughout the flight and were pleasant enough when engaged. The large touchscreen IFE system is responsive, the airshow and onboard cameras great (during the day) but I felt the content available could have been expanded greatly. It seemed somewhat limited for a flight that long. The catering on all sectors seems to have not changed all that much over the years that I have flown with CX on this route. The tray is small, the portions are just adequate and sound better on the printed menu card than they taste. No amenity kits provided. A small, self-serve snack bar was set up in the galley for the long haul to HKG. From there to SIN, it was an A330 with the last generation seats, which were as comfortable but there seemed to be less legroom. A full flight with a similar experience with meals and crew. I would certainly fly CX on this route again, especially since its a quick, comfortable easy way to Singapore from the East Coast.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-01-10;" | I had a very pleasant flight from Hong Kong to New York with Cathay Pacific Airways. I was seated in 40K and suggest the bulkhead rows to anyone who doesn’t want to pony up the additional money for premium economy and doesn’t mind not having the option of having a bag with them during take off an landing as there’s significantly more legroom and the ability to climb over sleeping passengers. Staff are efficient, and were otherwise pleasant and fast to reboot my in-flight entertainment system that froze four hours into the flight. Food is better than average, economy seats have a nice recline so it’s possible to get some sleep. Once again proving that Asian, long haul carriers beat the US carriers any day. Be aware that Cathay doesn’t board by row or section, so the boarding process can be a bit nutty, also note, that they will not allow you to bring water purchased after security check on their plane, so don’t bother buying anything at the airport to bring on board with you.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2018-01-10;" | Zurich to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific - turns out there is a sting in the tail. I am heading out on a work trip - and purchased a business class ticket because I knew that I might need to change flights due to meeting changes. 9th January 2018 - I called to change my flight on the 17th January. I thought that this was a reasonable amount of time to change a business class ticket. I would have been disappointed, but completely accepted if there were no tickets. What I was told was that there were not any seats available in my ""booking class"". Not something that I had ever heard of before - nor as you can imagine something that they promote when enticing you to buy their flexible ticket. Complete scam. They very kindly offered to: 1. allow me to pay the difference to the different booking class - what a scam! 2. go on a wait list for this booking class Lots of other business class seats available on the flight but no chance that this is what they will do. I asked if I could speak with someone who could help me - I had paid a lot of money after all so thought that this was unreasonable. I was told I could, but that the answer would be the same. When I said that I would still like to, I was then told that I actually couldn't because no one was there but i could wait on hold for up to 6 hours. I asked to go on the wait list and before I had pretty much finished saying the words I was hung up on. Not wanting to see if there was anything else I was needing, already have my money and no need to try any harder. All I can say is that you got my money this time but never again. Lots of other airlines out there who actually care about their customers.";NEGATIVE

Bangkok to Hong Kong on a regional 777-300. Seats were the old shell types. Boarding in Bangkok was chaotic, since the gate was poorly laid out, not the airline's fault. Seat: Though mildly comfortable, it wouldn't have been the best for my back if the flight was any longer than what it was (2 hrs 6 minutes). Padding was relatively rough and seat storage was limited. However, the positive side is that no one would recline into you. Hong Kong to Toronto on an older 777-300ER. Seats were standard of Cathay's long haul and made the 14-hour flight bearable and comfortable. Catering on both flights improved since my last trip, with the ice cream actually edible when handed out. The meals themselves were of adequate portions and tasted standard. Cabin crew were extremely pleasant on both flights, going out of their way to accommodate requests despite the turbulence both flights encountered along the way. Overall, another great trip with Cathay Pacific and I look forward to flying with them again.";POSITIVE

Although PE is advertised as having a dedicated check in, at T3 LHR the bag drop is shared with Economy and there was a 15 minute queue. Boarding went smoothly with PE prioritised after First and Business, and the lower density of seating meant there was plenty of space in the overhead lockers. Seats were comfortable and, as someone who is 6’4” tall, I was delighted to be able to stretch out. Seat recline for sleeping was also good, although when the seats in front of us were fully reclined, it was quite difficult to get out. Amenity kit had all the basics but nothing special. Cathay’s in flight entertainment system had a good selection of films etc, the screen was a decent size and I appreciated the noise cancelling headphones. Food was disappointing - most of the meals were similar to what I have typically experienced in Economy on other airlines.

The toilet was very easily accessible and clean as well. The flight attendants were very friendly and approachable, and service was superb. Food served was excellent as well. We arrived early, but took us at least 30mins to get through customs. Not the airline's fault, but made the journey worse. ";POSITIVE

No food menu, no drink menu, no food selection. I was woken up abruptly by the flight crew because they need me to straighten up the chair. In-flight entertainment was very minimal with old movies and limited choice of shows and music. I will avoid this airlines if I can.

However, the ice cream was almost liquid when received. Flight departed on time and arrived Hong Kong 20 minutes earlier than schedule. Hong Kong to Bangkok sector also on a 3-class 777-300ER. Similar to the long haul sector, cabin crew were pleasant and professional. Flight departed Hong Kong 15 minutes late but arrived Bangkok on time.

Crew did not offer to top up drinks or offered more bread. I asked for a mid flight snack and the noodle was still hard so asked for rhe burger which was actually very good. Breakfast option was also excellent but I was not offered coffee or hot drinks and for some reason I was ignored by cabin member who served people around me. The cabin service director, who after I complained about the robotic, unprofessional and indifferent service, came to see if all was ok, was horrified I was ignored.

HKG airport lounge first class lounge is far away from boarding gate. No announcement was made of the flight delay, and as you are not escorted to the plane (this service is standard procedure for some airlines) you end up waiting before a closed boarding gate! Luckily there was a closer Business class lounge (named the bridge I think), which proved perhaps more comfortable than the First class one. I decided to have them wait for me and didn’t move until they called my name (I was naughty but it was very late). The seat is extremely comfortable. Once transformed into your bed, it is very large.  A special mention for the pyjama. Flight attendants were very nice. The night ambiance of the plane was standard and I missed the privacy of Air France curtains or Singapore airline sliding doors. Breakfast was not memorable but I am very picky with breakfast.";POSITIVE

The seat was pretty comfortable as CX standard even if my charging port was not working and the entertainment selection good. On the other hand the meal was the worst part of the flight. The menus were distributed, but only one to be shared each 3 passengers (saving on paper?). Food was boring looking and not in a great quantity. Bread not very well heated. What is worst is that they serve filtered water from jars. Breakfast of congee or eggs with sausage. I believe that CX catering is most boring and predictable. Service was efficient but very cold. Next time I would consider flying with EK or QR. Despite the flights are not direct they are more enjoyable and much cheaper. 4 Hours more travelling are worth if you enjoy the experience more.";NEGATIVE

I chose Cathay Pacific because of a 24-hour flight to CCU. Only 2 stops, but it happened to be my worst flight experience ever! Flight from Vancouver was delayed, and connecting flight was missed. Cathay informed us that the quickest connection was to be a delay of 24-hours, and that via Singapore with one more stop. Thus, a 24 hour flight was now 48-hour flight. I missed my sister’s wedding, due to the sheer mismanagement of Cathay. Even after informing them about my urgency, they did not offer me a different route! When I checked online, I found a connection to Kolkata available which allowed me to reach earlier! On mentioning that to the ground staff, they informed us, it is not from a partner flight. hence they cannot offer that flight! Ground staff did not know how to apply for a Hong Kong permit. Hence, we did not get a Visa, and had to stay in the airport lounge for one whole night. The lounge did not have a place to sleep. In-flight, the flight attendants could not provide me the meal I asked for. They offered me a vegetarian meal, when I specifically asked for a non-vegetarian chicken meal. Thus, during this experience with Cathay, I did get the flights I booked the tickets for, did not get the food I asked for, nor did I get a place to sleep at night. The staff and customer service was also not cooperative at all. The customer support was very negligent, and did not reply favorably to my request. I am a student, and strive hard to make to ends meet. I do not have any extra money to waste on an irresponsible airline, who does not try to attend to their customers. I would discourage anyone to travel through Cathay Pacific due to their poor services. ";NEGATIVE

They were such excellent experiences that they became the Holy Grail for good service. However I didn't travel to the Far East again until recently. We booked Premium Economy expecting our previous service to be surpassed. I would still recommend Cathay based on reliability and the competence and courtesy of all their ground and air crews. However the space and meals in Premium Economy left a lot to be desired. I realize that a lot has changed in 10 years but recent Premium Economy experiences on Lufthansa, Air Canada and BA to Europe were much better. The food was awful particularly on the HKG to YVR leg. The menu promised a selection of several wines but only two were on hand and the white was warm. The food was wretched and I'm not one to complain. It was overcooked, cheaply made, unimaginative and served in awkward plastic containers. Absolutely nothing premium about it and if economy is worse then something is amiss with their customer service strategy. I wonder if inconsistency is a problem because we could only book economy of their flight to Hanoi where we were surprised to be served a meal at all and it was better than the ones on the long haul premium flights. The seats were not roomy and the look and feel of the cabin was grubby. The hard-working and pleasant crew spent an unusual amount of time flogging their Duty Free products which made us feel like we were on EasyJet at times. In short, service and style has deteriorated from past experiences. Another factor may have been the over-zealous and officious crew director.";POSITIVE

If you wanted another drink apart from your meal one you had to get up and walk to the back where all of them were standing around chatting and laughing to ask them for one but only a small amount of water was offered. I tried to be helpful with our dinner trays and was told not to do it again as it was not helpful! When I was putting my hand luggage up in the locker a stewardess barged past me making me fall into the seats. The list goes on and on.

I realize that preparing food in the air presents particular challenges, but I don't know why airlines serve overcooked and underseasoned dishes.

The First lounges are hard to find and not worth the trouble as the service and food are limited and worse than in business. For goodness sake: Even at the home airport of Hong Kong, there was no help with finding how to transit or to find the lounge.

To begin with, check-in at CDG was unsatisfactory. After using their automated check-in, we were to drop our suitcases. We are small-framed females, but the man at the counter did not help us putting the suitcases on the drop-in counter at all. He was just watching and waiting for us to lift our suitcases even after we repeatedly asked for help. We told him that my sister broke her wrist and was unable to lift the suitcase. Only after that, he finally very reluctantly helped us. On board, our seats were far back in the cabin, but not the very last in the row. During the meal service, an FA in our aisle started to serve the meal from the front, but she was slower than the FA serving the meal for the other aisle. Finally, another FA started to serve the meal to people sitting behind us. We were the last ones being served and consequently ended up not getting the choice of meal. The FA offered fish, saying ""it’s low cal"" as if we need to save our caloric intake! Being the last ones to get served and not getting what we wanted made us very unhappy. The entertainment is OK. The aircraft was a bit old. Meal quality is mediocre. I’ve flown with CX several times, but maybe it’s time to consider another choice.";NEGATIVE

Seat comfort is fairly standard, cramped economy class of today, but I was shocked at condition of the cabin. Many seats with damaged, torn covers, armrests dented and scratched and stains on the carpets. Worst of all is the poor food served and I would have rather a low-cost option where I could buy something decent to eat onboard.

Cathay Pacific did not have a good style of boarding, rather than boarding economy from back to front to avoid congestion, all of economy was called at once and boarding took way too long and there was too much isle congestion. The cabin crew were not friendly or helpful at all, on most airlines I've flown the cabin crew greet you and direct you to your seat, on Cathay you get on, nothing happens and you find your own way, the crew just stood there talking. The seats were comfortable although the seat pockets on the seats were directly connected with fabric and no internal plastic, meaning whenever you or somebody else went into the seat pocket, the person in front felt it quite a lot and it was frustrating while trying to sleep. The meal options werent great, considering it was a flight from England to Asia, you'd expect there to be British style options as well as Asian, not on this flight. On dinner service the crew were rude, ""what do you want"" I understand their first language is not english, but being a flight from an English speaking country you'd expect there to be a little better knowledge. I noticed most people had bread rolls, I didn't get one so I asked for one, the attendant thought I was trying to get two and explained it was only one per passenger, I told her that I hadn't been given one and she didn't believe me. All in all the flight was average, but Cathay was disappointing and I wouldn't fly with them in future unless it was considerably cheaper than other options.";NEGATIVE

But first, the Premium Economy section toilet was broken, so we had to go way down the back of the plane and stand in long queues to use the loo. There was no salt and pepper. We asked, they said ok. It never came. We asked for water and got two cups of warm water. We were told there was no ice cream choice, chocolate or nothing, and then they served strawberry to the rear. They did not distribute immigration forms for Hong Kong, which delayed our processing, and which is inexcusable slackness. The tea is poor. The seats have a rigid divider, so when I needed to exit from my window seat I could not get past the man lying all the way back in the row in front and refusing to lift his seat for me. For all that I arrived in OK shape and had a safe and comfortable trip. Check in was efficient and friendly, I was a priority client needing a wheelchair and all of that was fine, albeit with a few reminders to the crew that a wheelchair was required on arrival in HK. I needed oxygen half way across, due to the long walk back from the loo and the struggle under the seat as described above, as I have a respiratory condition, the air was thin and I  was severely oxygen depleted, and the crew were marvelous about that. The seats were very comfortable for 12 hours (unlike the business class seats, which were bad for the backside, on our trip over to Europe).";POSITIVE

The flight arrived on schedule. Boeing 777 cabin and its 1-2-1 herring bone layout with fully flat seats is my favorite. It offers spaciousness and privacy. The entertainment system offered a large collection of films that could be accessed on an easy to use control pad. Good selection of entrees, wines, and various snacks, bathrooms kept clean, and attentive flight attendants made the flight a very pleasant experience. At JFK's Terminal 8 used by Oneworld, passport control was smooth - I used the automated passport reader and was out of the terminal in no time.

The food is a bit hit-and-miss for me, had a very delicious fish meal on the first flight and on another flight had a beef meal that tasted like something very simple I would cook at home quickly. For dessert they will give you an ice cream. There's also noodles available at any time during the flight if you like, and some other snacks like chocolate and chips. On the short haul flights they have chicken lattice pastry, it was very delicious.

The cabin crew proactively trying to accommodate seat change requests (some families were separated throughout the plane) despite the language barrier with some passengers who neither spoke English nor Chinese or Cantonese. Catering consistent for long haul flights. The one abnormal thing I found was the timing of the meal service. There was lunch service right after take off and the dinner was served mid-flight. After that, there were no meal service at all, just cup noodles upon request.

The new A350 on the Auckland / Hong Kong leg makes a big difference than the old A340. The crew were most friendly and professional. The window seats for us are the best features / direct aisle access but most of all the privacy from other passengers is what you are paying for. IFE was excellent on the A350 not so clear on the 777-300. The only disappoint for me is the food presentation and quality - its not that flash and could be better. But for us, its the cost and Cathy Pacific prices are far more competitive than than the likes of Air New Zealand, why pay 7000 NZD more each to reach the same destination and sit in inferior business class with no privacy.

By the time we arrived at HK there were just 35 minutes to catch my flight to London, I had to run to get to the internal security which was at the wrong end of the airport (had to take an internal train), when I got through to my horror the gate was a good 15 minutes away, again I had to rush to the gate, no time for lounge, made it with just a few minutes spare. I am not annoyed since this was not Cathay Pacific fault. From HKG to London, the flight was very comfortable and as I said before this A350 is so superior in so many ways. But I was not happy, I am in Business class and there were only two choices of meals and I could not eat either of them, ended up having starter, bread and cheese, I am sorry but this is not good enough, I paid a hefty price and to only have two choices of meals just because it is supper only.

My only other exposure to a Top 10 Airline is Singapore and therefore, most of the time, I was comparing my experiences with both airlines. Maybe it is me, but I felt the space between spaces was slightly wider on Cathay Pacific than Singapore. For economy, Cathay Pacific did not provide us with hand towels. The airplane felt a bit older, the flight from Hong Kong to Bali, the seats didn't even recline at all. They just slid down.

Flight from Vancouver was delayed 2 hours due to the late departure of the aircraft from its origin (New York-JFK). Ground staff in Vancouver assured me I would have time to make the connection in Hong Kong due to the shorter flight time than usual (12.25hrs on the YVR-HKG sector compared to the usual 13.00+ hrs). I was skeptical due to my past experiences with this particular itinerary. I had no choice but to keep my old connecting flight. As a Marco Polo Club Silver Member, I was entitled to use the First and Business Class lounge in Vancouver. The YVR lounge is definitely superior to some in Hong Kong due to less crowds and quality staff. The serenity and assuring gestures from the lounge staff calmed me down and depleted my anxiety about my connecting flight. Flight to Hong Kong on a Boeing 777. Seat was very spacious with several storage compartments even in Economy Class. Inflight meals were standard as per Cathay's long haul service and cabin crew worked hard to meet every need to passengers. Arrived Hong Kong an hour later than initially scheduled, only to find out my original connection was delayed by 2 hours. Although slightly devastated, I was relieved as I no longer had to run to make the flight. The Bridge lounge in Hong Kong had adequate space and serenity for me to relax and rest prior to my connecting flight. Cathay Pacific has excelled with their lounges, whether it be the space or amenities/facilities. Flight to Bangkok boarded on time with the new departure time but took almost an hour to obtain clearance from Air Traffic Control due to the busy period at Hong Kong Airport. Ultimately, flight departed Hong Kong 3 hours late and arrived Bangkok almost 4 hours late due to congestion at Bangkok Airport, resulting in a holding of almost 30 minutes. I was upgraded to Premium Economy for the Airbus A350 flight and the seat seemed a bit tighter than the ones found on the 777s, yet the amenities and more updated IFE made up for the flaws of the seat. Service was essentially the same as Economy for the short haul and crew were great throughout.

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-08-11;" |  Mumbai to San Francisco via Hong Kong in economy and when possible I prefer Cathay Pacific primarily because Hong Kong is probably one of the best connecting airports. The airport is well designed, security checks are fast and reasonable. And if you have a long connection, there is a free visa on arrival, which lets you explore Hong Kong city. On occasion, I book a 12 H transit halt so I can relax in HK for a bit. While the service and amenities aren't the best, especially when compared to airlines like Emirates, it isn't the worst either. The food is fairly good. They carry one Asian, one Western and one veggie (usually pasta) entree. The dessert is almost always haagen-dazs vanilla ice-cream with a mini-chocolate bar. (Although once I did get Mövenpick) As a frequent traveler on the airline - it does get boring to get the same dessert and same choices. You can almost start predicting the menu after a bit.  If you are a whiskey person they have Chivas Regal 12 on their carts.  They also have a specially developed beer, designed to taste great in a pressurized cabin, called Betsy. Named after Cathay's first airplane - the beer is actually pretty good. The entertainment system is good. They have a very good selection of the latest English and Chinese movies, TV shows and TED talks. I find their short film section to be particularly interesting. I usually listen to classical music on long flights - and in this department their selection excels. There is usually a selection of newspapers like the New York Times and The South China Morning Post apart from leading newspapers in Mandarin just before you board. Their in-flight magazine Discovery makes for a very engaging read.  The online booking and web check-in interface is very dated, and occasionally buggy. The interface of their frequent flier program isn't the best either, but on the plus side, they do ship a physical card to your postal address - which is a nice touch. I hope they improve their technology soon. A big sore-point for me personally is the lack on Wifi on the A330 and B777 fleet. The newer planes (A350) supposedly have Wifi - however I have never personally been on those flights. Overall the lavatories are well maintained and I have always found the crew to be standout helpful. While not the best airline to take the skies with, it is certainly far from the worst.";POSITIVE

Even though just a 2-hour flight, a full lunch service including steak and two other options for main course, and started with drinks (excellent selection of wines, including a well selected Marlborough Sav Blanc). Seats are herringbone lie-flats in a 1-2-1 row with lots of room and storage spaces, a large flat screen offers a wide range of entertainment options that can be viewed from the minute you sit down - and during takeoff and landing. The seat's design has excellent privacy features, so if you are in one of the center seats, you don't have to see the other center seat occupant, and all seats are shielded from aisle traffic and views of seats from across the aisle. the lavs at the front are large, windowed and perfectly placed (not at the very front which would require navigating through the galley and resting crew members). The A350 features on-board WiFi though didn't use it. The cabin felt roomier and more quiet than other wide-bodys in CX's fleet. The crew were both professional and friendly - very attentive but not overly so. I've flown 507417 in CX on 777-300, A340, and 747 (now all retired) and think the A350 has the others beat.

Quality of the flight was good, the crew were friendly, food was ok (but not outstanding) and the special extra was the noodle soup that could be ordered as a snack anytime. The deciding factor to book this airline, was the 30kg baggage allowance, otherwise only given by by few other airlines (Thai Airways, Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines are known to me). The other reason was the price. Booking early meant that we got the cheapest booking class, so the price was low, not lower than other airlines for their cheapest booking class. However the booking class was the biggest caveat. It's this bad, that I will never book this airline again. The problem is like this. When you get one of the the two lowest booking classes, you can't select your seat before check-in. When check-in opens 48 hours before the flight, there is a mouse race for the very last seats that haven't been reserved yet, as all other booking classes can select their seats before check-in. For us this meant that you either can't check-in online at all (as there are no seats to choose anymore), as it happened on the first way. Or you can select only separated seats for a couple travelling together, as it happened on the way back. The seats for the second leg we only got in transit, even the check-in staff at the counter couldn't give us any seats and of course we were not sitting together. So either you get a good price, but then the airline treats you as a second grade passenger, or you miss the good price and then there are better offers. ";NEGATIVE

Inflight entertainment options were very good, and I was pleased that the Ed Sheeran album ""Divide"", a personal favorite of mine, was offered. Pushback commenced and the A330 was able to take off. The flight to Manila offered the high standard of service Cathay Pacific is known for. The seat was comfortable and had good legroom, despite it being the middle seat. Highly recommended and would fly again!";POSITIVE

This was annoying and cumbersome. The call centre staff member that I spoke with was irritable and short in his responses. It became so bad that I asked to speak to his manager and only then did he become moderately professional. Then very to my huge disappointment he had altered my meal request to a special meal not of my choosing. The plane staff exchanged these unfortunate mistakes with only faint annoyance. Their newer aircraft was great. Comfy, spacious and good service. The older Boeing 777 was less comfortable and the staff were much less generous especially in regards to disallowing me to board with a car seat and umbrella stroller. These items were taken from me to be checked as I boarded and were lost for two days after my flight which made an extra two hours at the airport.";NEGATIVE

The space is good but the seat itself is way more uncomfortable than a low cost airline seat with no recline at all. I hope they will phase out all these seats soon! As always in internal Asia routes, food very average quality and boring. Pasta or pork with rice. Same desserts as always: Haagen Dazs icecream. Don't they think that their valued frequent flyers could be bored on having the same dessert in every single CX flight? Entertainment choice as always not the best but good enough. Overall an average flight in a route where there are much more pleasant Korean carriers to choose from. Will think twice next time about which one to choose even if I am a high tier CX frequent flier.";NEGATIVE

We made ourselves comfortable and sat within the aircraft for over 30min without any information provided by the crew. At last the captain made an announcement that there are technical flaws with the aircraft and that he has no choice but to cancel the flight. So all passengers were taken off the flight and once in the ground we were informed that they intend to transfer us to a Qantas flight to depart 3 hours later. I had a 4 hour transit at Hong kong prior to my next flight to Colombo and when I mentioned this to the ground staff they were quiet assuring that I would be there on time to catch my next flight. 3 hours passed and they picked a few passengers ""randomly"" to have the previledge of flying the Qantas flight while the rest of us kept sitting in patience. When inquired as to what is going on the ground staff replied ""sir we have got permission only for limited passengers and so we picked a few randomly."" So what happens to the rest? The answer was that the rest would be flying through Cathay Pacific in their next scheduled departure which was 8 hours after our original departure time. No lounges were provided, just food coupons. Then time passed and we were at last on board a flight, landed in Hong kong having missed my connecting flight. We were informed that all passengers to Colombo will be flown to Singapore and then from Singapore to Colombo via Sri lanka Airlines. All in all we arrived in Colombo 18 hours after our original arrival time and to find out that our luggages have not arrived with us. It was a horrible service with poor customer service.";NEGATIVE

Lounge in HKG was okay but unbelievably crowded and no better than a pay to use facility, and the airline has cut back on food in the lounge. Onboard service was okay, but staff seemed very demotivated and just plain tired. Probably not helped by the very clear cutbacks in the business class items served inflight nowadays compared to 3 years ago. The food was awful and portions tiny, and even amenity type items seem to have suffered major cuts. It seems the airline has let financial problems filter through to what the passenger receives.";NEGATIVE

At Changi, I checked in using the FAST check in counters-seems like Cathay has moved to self check-in for almost all its passengers(with the exception of priority passengers-Marco Polo Club, oneWorld members, etc.), although there were staff on hand to assist passengers in checking in, and they were helpful. Flight was delayed due to late arrival of aircraft. Boarding efficient, cabin had a comfortable feel and the seat was as good as those found on the economy class of SQ and TG A350s, but the charging port was hard to access, although not a problem for me, being a 2hr+ flight. Cathay provided the passengers with exterior camera views of the aircraft through the IFE, with a tail and front camera provided. Cabin crew were attentive, if robotic at times. However, the onboard drinks selection was a bit narrow, and the food served was dismal, comparable to my domestic flight on Air China. Overall, I would recommend Cathay, although they do need to ramp up their regional service if they want to compete on this route).";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-07-20;" | I've been flying with Cathay for 26 years. My family and I are all Marco Polo members ranging from green to gold. Today I waited 9.5 hours at the airport for my flight from Sydney to Hong Kong (CX110, now CX162), and now I'm told it'll be another 30 mins wait. I understand that HK is experiencing bad weather and I was told the plane had a mechanical problem but there has been problems with the way they dealt with this issue. They never made an announcement about the cancelled flight until well after the anticipated boarding time. When we approached the front desk we were told that the flight is cancelled and we were transferred to a later flight. Staff said if they made an announcement then it would create a commotion. It makes no logical sense. I said lots of people are probably still waiting for the announcement. Fast forward to the plane ride: the most shoddy plane ride ever. I've flown with many airlines - even down to tiny airlines like Air Timor. This has got to be the worst plane I've flown. The backs of our seats could not be controlled and went up and down just by leaning on it. We were shifted to the back for take off and the TV did not work (I have to say the inflight manager was nice about it). The cold water button in the bathroom didn't work. I saw staff roll their eyes after talking to passengers. As I was put in the last seat on the plane on this service, I also heard all the gossip about passengers from the staff at the back. I have booked 3 more flights with Cathay in the coming 2 weeks and I'm really dreading it.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-07-12;" |  I hadn't flown Cathay Pacific for a number of years, but I always remembered them being a very comfortable airline offering a better than average product. As a disclaimer, my airline of choice for this route (Los Angeles to Singapore via Hong Kong) has always been Singapore Airlines, so I realize I may have high standards. However, I'm still just an average economy traveler who simply expects to be taken care of on long flights. The trip out from LAX to SIN was a bit treacherous due to mechanical problems. This, I understand, but the way the airline handled it was - I'd say - less than satisfactory. I had a scheduled 01.25 departure that was delayed 11 hours. I was not made aware of the fact until 19.00 the night of my flight. The reason for the delay was the plane had engine problems when it was leaving HK (for LAX) and had to turn around, but what made it extremely confusing was that the airline somehow did not make the delay public knowledge (Google Flights, Flight Tracker and others had the flight noted as an on time departure), so there was quite a bit of confusion. I decided to arrive at the airport at my normal time (~2 hrs prior) at which point the delay was confirmed. I asked if they could put me on another flight of any other airline because I was going to SIN for a family emergency and I was told there were no available seats. They offered to put me up in a hotel which I accepted and gave me meal vouchers that didn't cover the cost of a single dish (for either dinner or breakfast - $25 and $15 respectively). The next morning upon check-in, I was told that my flights out were not full because they had moved many passengers to other flights/airlines - this really irritated me because I was told there were no available seats the night before. Once I finally arrived in HK (11.5 hours later than expected), my flight to SIN was delayed an additional 4 hours. At this point, I went to the CX counter and kindly asked for a pass to the lounge so I could rest and shower, since I'd already been delayed in my travels. They said they couldn't help me because they'd already compensated me in LA with the hotel stay. This irritated me. I understand that the airline may feel that I've been compensated, but I don't understand what it would have 'cost them' to provide a little extra customer service to a tired traveler asking to rest as a result of their delays. CX is based in HK and has multiple lounges in the airport. I suppose I was asking too much, but it was frustrating nonetheless. Both flights out felt both rushed and inadequately supplied (in terms of meals and personnel) making for a less than comfortable experience for such long flights. A route that normally takes me about 22-24 hours to complete (door to door) ended up taking about 37 hours and the overall experience left me with a slightly less than stellar opinion. I have to say, the flights back were on schedule and slightly better, but the overall experience was still not what I remember, nor what I'm currently used to. I would recommend CX because I know my initial experience was a bit of an anomaly, however, it does not change the fact that I am/was disappointed and wish the delays were handled better.";POSITIVE

We boarded smoothly on an airbus A350 - the newest aircraft in the fleet. In the air, the service was excellent. The cabin crew were hospitable and the seats were spacious.

The flight was pleasant enough with adequate meals and friendly, if robotic crew. The seat, while refurbished still had that flimsy feel and the latch securing the life jacket in my seat fell off during takeoff. IFE system was nice and crisply responsive and full marks on the very entertaining interactive airshow. The outbound flight to EWR after 4.5 hours of transit had the herringbone full flat seats. While the configuration decreased seat width, especially when it was converted to a bed, it was still cozy and comfortable. Service was a lot warmer and prompt. The food was surprisingly tasty even if CX catering isn't the best in the business. Drink selection was adequate, but not as extensive as SQ. IFE also adequate but a bit more dated than the one found on the A350. I think it's high time CX upgrades these. Slept for 7 hours.";POSITIVE

Power is provided via USB and the entertainment is excellent. I love the playlist function and variety. Like all other 5 star airlines you are still given nice meals and drinks during the flight.

Small things - like taking a half finished drink away 'for take off' even though we had a delay on the ground. Food wheeled out on a trolley for you to choose means its getting cold by the time its a few rows back into the service. Hardly surprising therefore that Cathay are finding times tough.

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-07-08;" |  Auckland to London Heathrow via Hong Kong. On this flight I was seated in Premium Economy Row 33A. Boarding at Hong Kong was unorganized and chaotic, firstly being advised boarding was from gate 2, then later advised it was changed to gate 29. No announcements were made until boarding over 1 hour later than expected (which I find puzzling having flown multiple International flights with other airlines in the past 22 years). When boarding did commence again no boarding procedure as with other airlines which normally call for First and loyalty passengers boarding first or passengers with limited mobility and parents with young children. There were lines marked Business, Economy and it seemed most people queued in the Business line (which surprised me there were so many Business seats on this flight). When finally boarded 1 hour late the Captain announced the late departure was due to our plane being towed between gates, then having lost its departure slot had to wait with heavy number of aircraft ahead of us from China. This would have been perfectly acceptable if passengers were advised in the departure lounge. Onboard seats were good but not as comfortable as the flight from Auckland to Hong Kong on board CX198 which was an A350-900 (35G) However on the flight from Hong Kong to Heathrow we encountered problems in using the toilet as the toilet for Premium Economy passengers was situated in front of seats 32 H/K but the only access was by walking in front of 4 passengers seated in row 30 D-G which upset them due there being insufficient space to do this and resulted in fellow Premium Economy class passengers tripping over their out stretched legs and belongings. I am amazed that when designing an aircraft passenger accessibility is not taken into account and if they did they must have used a very small person to bypass very small upright people to gain access to this toilet or installed it with the view that only passengers seated on the right side of the aircraft would use it. I resorted to using the toilet in Business class as I had observed other PE passengers doing, however a flight attendant was waiting as I exited the toilet cubicle and commenced to give me a very severe dressing down who informed me I had no right being there and made me feel very inferior. I asked where I should go (I would like to point out at this stage that I am a 71 year old female with bladder problems) I was told it was preferable to use the toilets back near row 45 in Economy. This meant I had to queue up with the remaining 62 passengers seated in this Economy section of the aircraft. Not very satisfactory considering we had paid almost double the price of an Economy class ticket! Apart from this I found the Entertainment choices were really disappointing especially compared to the Entertainment on Emirates. There was very little choice of music or films and most were aimed at Asian audiences, in spite of a large proportion of the aircrafts passengers being European. Food was good but not brilliant, very little was offered in terms of pre dinner drinks. Would I fly or recommend this airline again, probably not given my experience and very disappointed after spending more than we normally do on airline tickets. However we have yet to return from Heathrow to Auckland at the end of August but doubt if they would have sorted out their toilet access by then!";NEGATIVE

Business class seat in Cathay Pacific is cramped and narrow and although there is lots of privacy the seat gives a claustrofobic feel. Impossible to have a decent sleep on a 11 hour flight, because there is a lack of width. Service is not very attentive and food and beverage (especially the wines!) are more economy class level than premium level. First class lounge in HKG is great, although also here a lack of service of staff. The Seat on the new A350 is even more cramped and narrow, not suitable for long haul travel. All in all a very disappointing experience and cannot recommend. Cathay Pacific does not deserve 5-Star rating for their business class product.

Regarding the on board experience, the A333 is a relatively new aircraft within Cathay's fleet. The monitor is large, clear and sensitive, the inflight entertainment system is very decent, with many movies, TV programmes and music.  The seat itself is comfy, legroom is sufficient. When it comes to food though, it is a disaster. I chose a rice with sweet and sour fish. The fish was terrible. I would never know it was fish if i were to taste it blindly.

We cross confirmed with the check in counter staff to provide us two adjacent seats and despite her confirmation that the seats are adjacent, we found that that they were two separate seats in the same row. The seats were very uncomfortable. Many staff were extremely curt. It was a midnight 5 hour flight which was delayed. And they did not serve anything to us for the next 3 hour.

The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK, Asia and western movies, TV programmes and music. And touch screen monitor is responsive. Unlike the one fitted on Hong Kong airline where you have to touch it ten times before the screen senses your response.";POSITIVE

Small issues but many of them. Flight attendants, when pressed admitted the galleys are not user friendly as well and that always affects things. I wouldn't avoid it but I can't help feeling they went with the cheapest design available much like American did on its A321 jet that it uses to Hawaii a lot from the west coast.

But who would have known we (me and my friend) would need a visa just to transit in Vancouver for 2 hours? Apparently we are not the only ones who were refused to board because of this reason. As a result, we had to pay 200$ each person to go on a different plane. They put us a ""Wait list"" because all the flights were over-booked for 2 weeks.

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-05-27;" |  I thought flying Cathay Pacific economy on an ultra long haul flight 3 weeks after returning from a similar distance in J would be a huge disappointment, but life (and CX) holds numerous surprises. Being a Marco Polo Club member allowed me to check in my entire family using the priority lanes on both outbound and return. The advantage was seen in the Manila to Hong Kong route where the check in queues at NAIA 3 seemed to snake around forever. Staff in MNL were courteous enough. Departing MNL through gate 111 was extremely chaotic. I would suggest that one hang around one of the pay-in lounges or in one of the (few) coffee shops outside the gate until the last minute. The MNL-HKG leg was the usual, rushed ultra short flight with absolutely no catering worth mentioning consisting of an overheated pastry, ANZAC cookie and boxed juice drink. PAL serves hot meals on their MNL-HKG flights even in economy, I wonder why a carrier such as CX still continues to think that this budget airline move is worthy of a 5-star airline? Same experience on the return HKG-MNL leg. The long haul product proved to be a pleasant surprise. The seats were more comfortable than expected and the 3-3-3 configuration does a lot for the perception of space in the back cabin. Catering is not CX's strong point, but the meals served were actually edible. The snack option of cup noodles were very tasty and the galley snack tray was always full. In-flight staff were pretty good with ready smiles and service. Good and frequent drink runs were made throughout the 16 hour journey both ways. I would say that it was a pleasant surprise through the long haul leg. I am on the fence regarding the IFE choices, but the hardware is pretty good if you bring your own earphones (the one provided by CX is rubbish). Touch screen was quite sensitive so there is little chance of bothering the passenger seated in front.";POSITIVE

A couple on our honeymoon were separated on the flight, the rude assistants at the check in desk couldn't do anything about it as it was a full flight and we had to wait until the flight was boarding to see if we could sit together. After a huge debacle, we got seated together at the very back of the plane with NO apology whatsoever. I will never fly them again. Bad food, bad service, old planes.";NEGATIVE

However, while boarding both flights, I was upgraded to Business Class. Bangkok to Hong Kong on a brand new A350. Though the seat itself wasn't different from the ones on the Boeing 777-300ERs, the refreshed IFE, alongside with the retouches of the storage space made the hard product a solid one. The flight attendants were professional. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 9-year old 777-300ER. I would say the thing that stood out to me most on this flight was the cabin crew, who were proactive. Catering was a big improvement from my previous trip, with meals served in appropriate portions and tasted amazing! Both flights departed and arrived punctually. Bags were quick to arrive and I was out of the airport within 20 minutes of arriving, which is rare when flying into Vancouver.";POSITIVE

Good food, good movies for entertainment. Cabin crew are nice and friendly. For my inbound flight from LAX to SGN, I cannot self check-in due to some technical issue and their staffs are willing to help. Only one thing I want to complain about this flight is the crying children around me. I know no one can control crying children but I think cabin crew should do something so other passengers don't feel annoyed. ";POSITIVE

At Vancouver check-in the lady who checked me in was cheerful and funny, contrary to my previous experiences while checking in in Vancouver. I was initially supposed to fly in Premium Economy Class for the entire itinerary until I was notified of a seat change on my flight from Vancouver to Hong Kong. An upgrade to Business Class was definitely a true blessing on a transpacific flight and I couldn't be more impressed with the service I received. The Cathay Pacific lounge in Vancouver provides such a serenade prior to a long-haul flights, where the staff were so accommodating. The crew were prompt to respond to requests and made me feel welcome and comfortable. The seat didn't feel too different from the regular Premium Economy seat in terms of width, however, when turned into a flat bed, provided one of the best sleeps I've had among other Business Class I have experienced. I appreciated the details put into the seat,  adequate storage and the mirror in one of the compartments, and light at one of the storage areas. Despite all the positives, I felt indifferent towards the catering. Though the main courses and drinks were great, there were components of the meals that left me underwhelmed. Arrived Hong Kong on schedule and made my way to The Wing lounge. Staff were enthusiastic to help. Hong Kong to Bangkok in a bulkhead seat in Premium Economy Class. Despite my love towards the bulkhead seat on Cathay's Economy, I was at fault for selecting this bulkhead in Premium Economy. The fact that the personal screen couldn't be used during take-off and landing made for a very boring flight for me, again, not at all the airline's fault. Since it was a regional flight, meal service was similar to that of Economy Class, and it was a standard breakfast meal which satisfied me. Crew service on this short flight left a bit to be desired, but since it was a rather early morning flight, the cabin itself seemed dry. Bags were among the first ones out in Bangkok and I was out of the airport within 30 minutes of arriving. On-time departure and arrival on both flights. Overall, though there were things that could be improved, this has been my best journey so far and I look forward to use their service again very soon.";POSITIVE

I arrived luckily 2 hours before my flight. Told at check in that my flight was cancelled and that we had 15 minutes to make the earlier flight. The kicker was US$400 in overweight charges for 2 suitcases. We were told that before we left that since we had flown business to Taipei that the charges would be minimal. Great surprise. Pay up or be stranded in Hong Kong. Manager of zero assistance despite showing JFK boarding passes. Customer service on return home of no help either.;NEGATIVE

The aircraft was quite old but the interior was fresh. The seats were very spacious. The entertainment system had lots of movies, but it didnt match my preferences. After takeoff, lunch was served, but it was a bit too slow, just about 1 hour and 30 minutes after takeoff, we were now served our meals. My meal was chicken with rice and ocra. I dont like ocra so I wasn't able to taste it, but the rice and chicken, very delicious. The flight had sone light turbulence. All in all, a very pleasant flight.";POSITIVE

A bit robotic at moments but always smiling and willing to help. Hot meal was good. Selection of beverages also good with a welcome drink served. Very good seat pitch on this A330. Two negative points: selection of movies was really poor and plastic cutlery provided for meals. Would fly again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-05-07;" |  When I lived in Hong Kong, Cathay was my favorite airline. The quality of meals and service have not advanced as far, this year, as Emirates, Etihad, and Turkish — the airlines I have most used of late. But my biggest gripe with Cathay is with their customer service. I flew home to the US to care for ailing relatives. I had bought a very economical economy seat and I knew the ticket was non-refundable and that there would be a fee should I have to extend my stay but the $650 Cathay wanted in order for me to change my return flight by one week was more than I paid for half my round-trip ticket. I told their phone rep the family's medical reasons I needed to stay, but it made no difference. When I suggested that I might as well look for a one-way flight cheaper than Cathay's change fee, she said only that I should call them if I wasn't going to use my ticket. ""Why?"" I inquired. ""There's no refund, right."" She replied that no, there was no refund, but that that would be the polite thing to do. Cathay Pacific has not been very polite to me. Never again, Cathay. ";NEGATIVE

Food in the Pier was very delicious and staff was well trained. But its a bit shame that I didn't get to use the bath tub facility in there, as it was too busy, and the bath staff were not particularly sorry for not being able to offer me this service. Went to the gate soon after having some food in the lounge. The first class cabin was small, however as you will sit in your own suite, it didnt feel small at all when settlted in. The crew was not as pleasant as the inbound crew. The food was a let down. Again the drink was nice and due to my experience on the outbound, I retracted the lumbar massage tool, and the seat became a fully flat bed and was wide on the shoulder area, so I could put my arms on the side. I asked for an extra duvet from the crew for comfort, but the due to the cabin was fully booked, the crew gave me a biz class blanket, which was less desirable. Had a solid 7 hour sleep onboard and that was my longest sleep on an aircraft, so missed all snacks etc. Overall happy flight, and a good rest is more than food and drinks to me.";POSITIVE

Their burger was very nice but the chinese sweet and sour and rice was below business class standard. Onboard crew was friendly and always has a smile on their faces, the drinks were great but not topped up by crew at all. First class seat was huge and comfortable, but when the crew made the bed for you, they forgot to fully retract the lumbar massage tool, so when I lay down, there was a massive lump in the bed, and I didnt know it was the lumbar massage tool. So it was fairly uncomfortable, other than that it was a nice trip in first class, and worth the money spent on it!";POSITIVE

On this trip which took me almost around the world I flew in all four cabins. While the hardware was consistent all the way through, the software varied. However all ground and inflight staff were hardworking and friendly. While the Vancouver-based crew seemed very cheerful and relaxed, the Hong Kong-based crew were a little bit more reserved but highly professional. On this trip I was served by the same crews - both Hong Bong- and Vancouver-based - twice which was a pleasant coincidence. I did the whole trip within 12 days. Thanks to the still outstanding and consistent service one knows what to expect. I got back home in a surprisingly good shape.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-05-01;" |  Hong Kong to London Gatwick. I used the Cathay Pacific Pier 1st class lounge. It was exceptional, three choices of champagne and probably the best hamburger and chips I've tasted. Sat on row 33K, the last row in the cabin. The recline was excellent and liked the leg rest - I am 5ft 5"" so works well for me. Pre departure drinks were juice, water or a glass of champagne. The food was okay, not as good as the outbound, the starter salad was a bit bland, I enjoyed my lamb and mash main, but my wife found the halibut needed more sauce. Dessert was Hagan Das ice cream. The choice of drinks were standard Economy, which actually wasn't bad. I did have a Chivas Regal with ginger but then stuck to water. Breakfast was either scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon and potatoes or a dim sum set, I had the former and it was okay, nothing special. There were plenty of snacks available throughout thr flight such as cookies, crisps, chocolate and cup noodles - just help yourself at the galley at the rear of the plane. In flight entertainment was excellent with some quite recent films, such as Star Wars Rogue One and Sing, which have just been released on DVD. Crew were sound, attentive and made regular water runs throughout the overnight flight. If there is one area of improvement is a dedicated PE toilet would be great. I normally fly Business class for long haul, but this flight was very good value £864 LGW to Bangkok via HKG. If this fare came up again I'd certainly take it over Business class at over £2k.";POSITIVE

Lots of leg room, a foot rest, champagne and a hot towel upon boarding, good food , pillow and great entertainment center. My flight from HKG-PVG was CX5890. During the last 45mins of the flight, my daughter had a reaction to eating something onboard that was cooked with a peanut ingredient. Yes, my daughter does have a peanut allergy and I did advise the airline prior to travelling. She was in the bathroom for the entire 45mins. I actually was very concerned about her. A flight attendant was so helpful and concerned for us. She advised her Captain and ordered a wheelchair for my daughter and I did decline a doctor to meet us at the gate. Overall, the flights and staff were exceptional. On our flight back to New York from Hong Kong, my family (6 of us) were surprised to be up graded to Business Class. I didn't even request it. That was such a special treat from Cathay Pacific. Special treatment all around and the best flight staff there is.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-04-27; | Dubai to Brisbane via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Both flights were very good. Flights left and arrived on time or a fraction earlier. Very good service and food. On the overnight flight from Dubai a supper was served then a continental breakfast in the morning. This enabled more sleeping time. Seats were good and flat bed. The only improvement which could be made would be for a mattress cover to be provided as is done by Qantas. It helps smooth out the bumps in the seat. The entertainment system is also good. The additional bonus of Cathay is the use of the Wings lounge in Hong Kong. Probably the best shower rooms of any lounge we have used. We will fly Cathay again.;POSITIVE

Food of a good standard but the crew were less than enthusiastic about offering me a second beer (they said they had run out). Seat fairly comfortable, IFE good, although the outside camera function wasn't great quality. Despite being a five-year-old aircraft the Boeing 777 seems quite dated inside, especially in comparison to the A350-900 which is amazing. Departed over two hours late due to engineering issues - no air con on boarding, so we stewed until the doors were opened to allow some airflow. Managed to make up about 45 mins en route.";POSITIVE

Food and beverages were good through. One toilet was unserviceable, which created some queues. Blankets and pillows were of a good standard.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-04-23;" |  I travelled Premium Economy from Hong Kong to Sydney and was interested in comparing to Air New Zealand's Permium Economy offering. Cathay Pacific is good but I favour Air New Zealand. Cathay's PE is like a step up from Economy while Air New Zealand is a step down from Business Class. Staff were welcoming and attentive. Seats were reasonably comfortable. Pre take off drink of Champagne or Orange Juice was offered as well as hot hand towels. Food was of a good standard, with proper cutlery and wine glasses. After takeoff the PE section toilets are made available to the Economy section so at times there was a queue for the toilets, which is not so good. Headphones were not noise cancelling and I did experience interference. Overall felt Premium Economy was worth the extra price paid compared to Economy, the superior seats and extra pampering meant I managed to get in a few hours sleep that can make a difference on long haul flights.";POSITIVE

I noticed the cabin was spotless, everything was clean, from tray tables to the bathroom. The menu was very good. I had chicken with rice which was heavenly. IFE was also very good, with a large variety of movies. Legroom was very decent and seat was also very comfy and I could sleep well. Overall, my experience was amazing.

At HK another quick trip to the lounge and then proceeded to board. Flight was full, took a little while to board.

After a quick stop to the lounge, it was a bit of a walk to gate 111 where there was quite a crowd boarding but the business lane was pretty quick getting onboard. Regional configuration in the MNL-HKG leg with good and warm service. Food was passable and forgettable, as can be expected by CX catering. After a 3 hour transit, the long HKG-ORD leg for a quick business trip to Chicago. Previously flew the A359 and the business seats on the 773 was a bit of a letdown compared to the fantastic newer product (it's a shame if the rumors are true that CX will change the business seats of the 359). Nonetheless, the reverse herringbone layout allows for great privacy and the seat provides numerous storage options for large and small items. Catering was better than the first leg with very responsive service and very unobtrusive for those who want to sleep. Special mention to the chief purser who made the service a joy. IFE was a bit of a letdown as well, but I suppose it was just that the selection of movies, while extensive, did not contain those that appealed to me. On the return leg, the company messed up the connecting day which was resolved very quickly on the ground in ORD. In-flight service to HKG and MNL was more robotic and less warm. They have a good business product, but for an Asian airline, I think it could up its game a little bit to play with the other big boys in the region (Singapore, ANA, Asiana).";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-03-28;" |  New York JFK to Hong Kong return. Although generally good service per reputation, several items were quite disappointing.  Cathay Pacific Airways does not subscribe to TSA Pre Check so security lines at JFK are particularly long. Second, they do not have wifi, which for a 15 hour flight is very isolating. Also, the return in premium economy was not markedly better than outbound in economy, except for bigger seat. Premium economy cabin service was spotty, trays left out long after meal with no follow up coffee or drink refills during or after dinner service. Food cart rammed my aisle knee very hard twice with little apology. As others have noted only 1 toilet for all of premium economy  which lead to long lines/wait times. They did not recognize One World affiliate FFs on same level. I am lifetime Gold in Advantage, but got nothing in terms of boarding, seat preference, upgrade consideration, etc. Check in was good but not above average. Overall, disappointing when compared to touted Asian carriers and almost as poor as AA, UAL or DL long haul.";NEGATIVE

Service remained top notch during and after meal service, with the purser greeting me. As a frequent Cathay flyer, these little touches make me feel more valued as a customer. The Pier Business Class lounge in Hong Kong is one of the finest. Error message from my boarding pass when boarding the flight to Vancouver. As a result, I was upgraded to Premium Economy class for the flight. Same deal, purser greeted me personally, and made sure I was comfortable periodically during the 11-hour flight. Catering was consistent on both legs in both cabins, nothing too exciting. Ground service: Check-In in Bangkok was fast and warm, felt welcomed by the smiles of the ground staff. Lounge front desk staff were a mix, some stiff faces but the majority are smiles. Bags came out first on arrival in Vancouver. Overall, very impressed with this journey. ";POSITIVE

Herring bone seating layout offered superb privacy. A fine collection of films to view including Hollywood classics (e.g., Casablanca) and very recent releases (e.g., La La Land). Would have liked some classics of Asian cinema by directors such as Kurosawa and Ray. The bathrooms were kept clean on the 15+ hour flight and the flatbed seat allowed for some good napping.

We arrived Hong Kong 45 minutes early. Hong Kong to Bangkok was on a full Boeing 777-200. At the boarding gate, our boarding passes (3 of us travelling together) got an error message after scanning, prompting the ground crew handing us our new upgraded boarding passes. Cathay Pacific's regional Business Class seats are acceptable. Not the most comfortable, it did provide me with some privacy that I would not get in Economy. The crew addressed us by name, and drinks were offered periodically. Economy catering remains consistent, nothing too exciting. Business Class catering I was impressed on how well food was presented on a regional flights. Everything tasted great and came in adequate portions. Finished off with Haagen Dazs ice cream.

Since the trip was immediate, I was unable to get seats together for my mother, my sister, and I during the Online Check-In process. At Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok), I asked the ground staff if she was able to move us together, and right away, though a little robotic, she managed to find us a row of seats together. The aircraft used on the Bangkok - Hong Kong sector was a Boeing 777-300ER. Due to a late inbound aircraft from Hong Kong, there was a 45-minute delay departing Bangkok and 20-minute delay arriving Hong Kong. Crew worked very hard during meal service, working around pretty demanding passengers and a short flight time. Transit in Hong Kong was uneventful, as most of the duty free area was already closed and the final flights of the night (at least Cathay Pacific connections to Europe/North America) were boarding. Hong Kong to Seoul on a refurbished A330-300. Flight departed early and arrived 25 minutes early into Seoul. There was a demanding passenger (specifically a tour guide) right next to us and she was demanding things from the cabin crew at the most inconvenient of time (right before take off, she was asking for immigration forms. and right before landing, she was asking water for her water bottle). The crew dealing with her declined her requests professionally but eventually fulfilled her requests after take-off/landing. Bags came promptly and we got out of the airport fairly quickly. Overall, the usual long-haul Cathay service scaled down (since both sectors were short-haul flights), yet the quality is still top notch.

Due to a mechanical issue with the aircraft, the flight from Vancouver was delayed by approximately 5 and a half hours. Check-in in Vancouver was a frenzy, with ground staff breaking the news to the passengers at half past midnight while trying to rebook as many passengers onto other flights (which were also extremely full, due to Spring Break). I have once stated this in one of my reviews, but it seems as if the ground staff in Vancouver are deteriorating. I was given told to ""go home and come back at 4.30am in the morning"". Dull responses such as ""We don't even know if the flight will leave. If the plane has a problem, we'll have to cancel the flight. But we won't know until 6.30am in the morning."" It was 1 in the morning, like how am I supposed to get home at this time? I was completely stressed out and realized I was going to miss my connecting flight to Bangkok. Nonetheless, I made my way to the lounge where the staff were much more understanding and tried their best to get us settled in before our flight. I was offered a bowl of noodle soup and blankets. Hence, I was able to grab a 4-hour nap before the flight was announced to be operational. I also managed to grab a shower before boarding which immensely helped me with my bitter mood from the night before. Vancouver to Hong Kong on the Oneworld livery aircraft. Crew was flawless and worked hard, non-stop, throughout the trans-Pacific flight, offering drinks and cup noodle every half an hour midflight. Arrived Hong Kong at almost noon time (originally scheduled for a 7am arrival) to an army of ground staff handling misconnections. I was rebooked onto the 8pm flight to Bangkok, and Cathay gave me a hotel room and a meal in the airport hotel as a compensation. The staff that assisted me offered every communication tool possible for me to communicate with my parents, who were waiting for me in Bangkok, as well as apologizing several times for the delay. I must say, although frustrated, I was impressed by how well all the staff in Hong Kong handled the misconnections, unlike the ones in Vancouver that weren't willing to help since they ""couldn't confirm if the flight was leaving or not."" (P.S. I didn't even receive my luggage tags upon check-in in Vancouver and the Hong Kong staff managed to get it for me in seconds). Hong Kong to Bangkok on a full Airbus A330. Cabin crew were trying their best to serve to everyone's needs, but with all seats in Economy filled on the flight, there were moments where I felt the service was a bit robotic.

We managed to get a seat, but the lounge was not good. Once on board the familiar good service from Cathay, with very attentive and polite cabin crew. Champagne Deutz, Brut Classic to start was very welcome. Meal service was good, my wife and I both had the seared barramundi, which was tasty and light. Film selection was updated for the new month and included some of the latest films including La La Land. Supper served prior to landing in HK and the Nasi Goreng was very tasty, but almost too large a meal! Flight arrived on schedule. Cathay have a number of lounges in HK and we took the opportunity to have a shower and change prior to the next flight onto London. We used the Wing Lounge, this was quite busy, but we were able to get a shower cubicle each without a wait. This was immaculately clean and stocked with fresh towels and toiletries. CX255 departed on schedule, this flight has the 4 class configuration with a large business class cabin, however service was still very good. I passed on the initial meal service to get some sleep. The flat bed is OK for someone of my height (1.83M), although quite narrow if lying on your side with knees bent. Managed to get a few hours sleep. Cathay provide bottles of water for each passenger so easy to keep hydrated during the night without needed to call for water.

The lunch consisted of a chicken pastry without noticeable chicken, a  cookie and one pack of sugary lemon tea. No choice of drinks or food was given. The menu was the same for the outbound flight as on return. Narrow legroom. Flight attendants were courteous. However, two cabin crew standing at the back of the cabin talked too loud, which was annoying for us sitting at the last row. The flight was on time.

Cathay Pacific seem to do a great job of looking after their frequent flyers. The lounge at Haneda is a haven of peace and calm and a great place to relax. Even though it was a 4 class Boeing 777, the plane appeared full. Departure and arrival on time. Professional, welcoming and attentive staff throughout the flight. Only complaint was the (Chinese) main course of the meal that was rather gloopy and unappealing, although the rest of the service was very good.";POSITIVE

They have never let me down and I am confident they will always be as supportive as possible in the event of travel difficulties. I no longer live in Asia so opportunities to fly with them are limited. I now will drive 150+ miles across the US/CAN border specifically to fly with them. The only thing I can find fault with is the food service which is perhaps the biggest disappointment and certainly could be stepped up a notch to give a top rated PE experience. This return flight was very full. We left the gate a few minutes late but arrived on time. Despite it being full, the PE cabin was served with the usual efficiency and professionalism of CX. The only downside to the 4.20pm flight is the absence of a dedicated toilet for the PE cabin but otherwise a great flight which was enjoyable and passed quickly and comfortably. Arrived in to YVR in good shape which I feel justifies the extra cost of PE. As always, kudos and thanks to CX.";POSITIVE

Greeted on boarding and welcomed with a glass of champagne. Premium economy seats comfortable and smaller cabin relaxed and quiet even cabin PE was almost full.

I have previously flown Cathay Pacific long haul and regionally within Asia in business class and have nothing but praise for the whole experience. This was the first time I have flown in coach with them. My only complaint is the seat itself. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I was in the first row of the economy section so leg room was also partially restricted because of the bulkhead, but it also had virtually no recline and the seat back was almost like a piece of wood. The flight was almost 5 hours and was pretty uncomfortable. Not taking the bulkhead would have been better as I would have at least been able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I'm only 5' 10"" so it's not like I'm overly tall. If you do want bulkhead in the first row then select the 3 seats on the window side as they do have more legroom. Aside from the seats everything else was great. The IFE is extensive and the service and food were very good. I'll still fly Cathay Pacific again but will just be more careful on seat selection in coach.";POSITIVE

The seat is big and legroom is spacious. Can't complain even if the meal served was the same as those in the Economy Class. The aircraft is new and very clean. Noise coming from the engine was very minimal. Overall, I was happy flying Cathay Pacific. Wifi onboard is available for a fee.";POSITIVE

Full flights in both directions but cabin crew worked hard and were very friendly and efficient. IFE had a broad selection of eastern and western films, more than enough to keep one entertained throughout the long flight. Food was a good standard for economy class and sufficient in quantity. Overall a good and reliable product. On the return journey (Hong Kong to London), as I dropped off my luggage very early at the airport, I was very kindly offered the chance to switch to an earlier flight. However, I declined it as I didn’t want to lose my seat selection (aisle seat). It was nice to have been offered, though. Boarding of my original flight was then delayed by an hour without warning, due to ‘technical reasons’. This was poorly communicated to the hundreds of passengers waiting at the gate, until the original departure time had elapsed. We were then advised by word of mouth (not the public intercom) to come back to the gate in an hour. This created a lot of sense of uncertainty as to what was happening with our flight. Once on board, the captain explained that a faulty oxygen tank valve had needed to be changed. Inflight service was good. The flight arrived about an hour late into London. Considering my overall experience, I would still fly this airline again.";POSITIVE

Took off 10 minutes late but arrived on time in Hong Kong, the flight was comfortable and just laid down to watch TV as I was not tired. Food is very good, just the right amount. At HKG had a quick coffee and went to catch my next flight, Boeing 777, a pleasant flight but arrived 10 minutes late. The notable difference between A350 and Boeing 777 are: No wifi on B777, you can watch tv prior to taking off and landing on the A350, substantially quieter and superior air ventilation compare to B777. And far easier for me to get to Gatwick then to Heathrow Airport.";POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-02-06;" |  On 20th December 2016 my wife and I were booked to fly Johannesburg to Hong Kong on South African Airways (SAA). Thereafter and on separate tickets we were booked to fly first class on Cathay Pacific CX711 to Singapore departing 16h10. We checked in on line prior to departing Johannesburg and received our boarding passes and booked our luggage through to Singapore. In-flight delays resulted in the SAA flight landing at 15h14. A lady with a sign with our flight number and names was at the gate. She expedited us through security to the gate. We waited 20 minutes before the flight was called and then presented our passports at the first class queue - our passports were duly checked, the boarding pass was initialled and we were advised to wait for boarding. When attempting to board at 15h55 we were advised that there was a problem and that we should take a seat. After 20 minutes we were advised by a Cathay gate clerk that we had been removed from the flight because our SAA flight had been delayed and that we had been placed on another flight. We questioned what flight and were told to wait. The plane left the gate at 16h21. At 16h40 I requested to speak to the station manager. I was then told that an SAA representative would come and advise us of the situation. This did not happen and I found a Cathay Pacific gate handler who said that we had been removed from the flight in accordance with Cathay Pacific’s policy of a connecting flight “having to have arrived within 60 minutes of the next flights departure”. We then questioned what other flight arrangement had been made. His response was that it was an SAA problem and that it had to be sorted out with SAA. No further help was forthcoming and no-one from Cathay Pacific would help us. We then asked as to where we could recover our cases and we were told to “get them off the SAA carousel”. We scoured the airport for our bags and after an hour found them on a carousel with Cathay Pacific “Offloaded”. We then set out to find another route to Singapore – this was impossible as it was the height of the festive season rush. After visiting several airline counters we eventually found 2 business class tickets available with Singapore Airlines (at a cost of USD 3200). Once home we attempted to resolve our issues with Cathay Pacific but merely received a string of emails deflecting responsibility to SAA. It is important to note that we complied with Cathay Pacific’s conditions of carriage which were that we had to have checked in one hour before the flight and that we had to be at the gate 40 minutes prior to departure – when we arrived at the gate we were in possession of boarding passes with our seat allocations. SAA could not be held liable under these circumstances. We have spent the last 8 weeks trying to obtain a refund of our first class airfare and have also tried to obtain compensation for our replacement tickets. No joy – just a run around from Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific maintain that they “reserved the right to assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boarding”. They maintain that this gave them the right to cancel our seats and sell them to someone else. If this is the way that Cathay Pacific treat first class passengers, I would hate to see how they treat everyone else.";NEGATIVE

Food was palatable with accompanying drinks, movies were ok, hostesses seemed attentive enough. The flight to London was a bonus with only half full so had three seats to lay out on - not the best but considering everything with economy it helped.

I experienced an unusual situation with this particular trip due to some issues beyond the CX's control as it concerns a passenger who asked to disembark as the plane was about to leave due to medical reason which caused an hour delay. I am satisfied with the overall service of Cathay Pacific. BAH-HKG on economy was pleasant. IFE was awesome, Menu had Filipino dish as option and I loved it. Ground crew in BAH airport not friendly, the 5 star rating for ground service is for the HKG crew. From HKG-MNL on Premium economy very comfortable, seat was amazing, monitor for IFE was huge, however mid-flight it stopped working on some Premium economy seats including mine. Cabin crew were very apologetic and tried to resolve the issue however they weren't able to. Again, very consistent. Thank you Cathay Pacific.";POSITIVE

The catering department obviously do not understand what gluten free means. While the normal menu offered choices the gluten free offering did not. The offerings were generally tasteless, even gluten free food from the main menu had been removed and the basis for the menu seemed to be vegetarian and dairy free, even butter and jam were taken out. We cannot understand what inspires a caterer to provide mixed boiled vegetables for breakfast! Having experienced this catering disaster outbound to New Zealand we addressed the issue with cabin staff on the return leg from Auckland to Hong Kong and the flight crew were extremely helpful and arranged more palatable meals from the main menu. They cannot be faulted. Needless to say we cannot recommend this airline to passengers with special dietary requirements until this problem has been properly addressed.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-01-27;" |  Flew Mumbai to Da Nang (or tried to) via Hong Kong with my wife and our 21 month old daughter. Flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong was fine, crew also. The trouble started when we got to Hong Kong about 20 minutes late and were met at the gate to be told we had already been shut out of the connecting flight to Da Nang. The connecting time was 1hr 10 minutes. I question why Cathay sell this route if they are going to operate on such a tight tolerance. We were taken to the desk where the ground staff first tried to fob us off with a flight 24hrs later and hotel. No good, not least because my wife would have needed a visa to leave the airport. Next, we were told to come back in 2hrs, and they took our boarding passes and gave us some vouchers for breakfast. I suppose better than nothing, though this is what it gets you. Though we were business class, no lounge available as we were the wrong side. When came back 2hrs later to the appointed place, things took on a nasty tone. First, the ground staff said they knew nothing about our situation and could not help because they needed the boarding passes. They even told me our connecting flight had already left - thanks for that! After trying in vain to get them to move, in the end, asked them to sign a statement with me that they did not know anything and so could not help - I said I'd leave them alone after that, sort things out myself and deal with Cathay later. They would not sign anything and said it was 'meaningless' to do so. Finally, another supervisor came over and we were eventually put on connecting flight via budget carrier and Vietnam Airlines via Hanoi. The only positive of this was that at least there was a Cathay staffer helping me with going in and out of immigration and check in /out of bags, laborious though it was. I repeatedly asked them to ensure the bags were checked through, which they said was done. After that, we were left to our own devices for a few hours, no lounge or anything even though we were business class and had a young child with us. The replacement flights were all economy too. Cathay still weren't done with us yet. When we got to Hanoi, thought it would be safer to check - lo and behold our bags weren't checked through. So once more, had to laboriously lug them between terminals, check in again. One finally arrived in Da Nang, 12h late, wrote a complaint and cancelled the return leg. Asked Cathay to refund 50% of the unused ticket and any difference for going via another carrier (there was none, as it turned out) since they could sell it on and it was 2 weeks away. I guess it was naïve to think Cathay would treat this reasonably, alas, after waiting 3 weeks for a reply, Cathay rejected it, hiding behind no refund policies and other than apologizing and offering USD150 / adult in travel vouchers, that was that. Any further pleas were met with a delayed response, apologies for the delay and hiding behind those policies. So we ended up seriously out of pocket, (whilst Cathay probably resold the seat too) hacked off with appalling treatment on all fronts. Never again will I fly this airline.";NEGATIVE

I do find it a bit weird since there are some lack of consistency in the service. The flight from Hong Kong to Beijing was operated by Cathay Dragon, and they actually had a better seat and better food - much better. The menu of the food is from the Grand Hyatt Hotel at The Bund and it taste very delicious, a privilege for flying economy. And there were discount on products for the Chinese New Year at Cathay Dragon but not on Cathay Pacific. This different service I found a little bit weird since a regional airline had better service than its international airline.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-01-23;" |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. I was pleased with a good flight experience. Airlines in the region have cut back on quality of service, noticeable in aspects such as a lower quality of food, and cabins that are not as clean or upgraded as often as they could be. Cathay Pacific Airways still has a 2-3-2 configuration on its A330 planes and this configuration does not support a premium experience when business class customers still have to climb over someone to get to the lav. One must choose one's seat wisely. Despite this, I believe that Cathay remains the best of premium airlines in the region. FA service was top notch and when the my experience is compared to North American or European carriers on flights of a similar length, Cathay is superior. The meal served on the flight while not as good as it used to be was still respectable. Beverage selection was good. Baggage delivery, airport experience in both BKK and HKG was excellent. I feel confident with the flight deck crew of CX. The lounge in BKK was fine and although a very limited selection of food, the lounge was clean, well staffed and welcoming. One doesn't go wrong when selecting business class on its more popular routes.";POSITIVE

Also the food is delicious and they served nice red wine in economy class.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2017-01-13;" |  Cathay Pacific premium economy is it worth it? The answer is only if the airplane is new. We flew from Hong Kong to Vancouver, and aside from service and food, the seats were just a tad bigger than economy seats. On the return, it was really like flying economy with the seat configuration being 2-4-2. Seat pitch was narrow and cramped. The only time we felt we were on premium economy was the Manila to Hong Kong leg of the trip because we had flown with a new plane and seats was noticeably wider. However meal was like economy - a boxed juice and a boxed sandwich. It's a good thing we paid the promo price. Unless you are assured of flying the new planes, I do not see any difference flying premium Eco as compared to economy except for a better service than economy.";NEGATIVE

Service was also like economy class - quick and fast with not much of a smile from cabin crew either. IFE was fine though. Food still average and these days its all Asian style food so if you want western food you out of luck. Unless they put on a new plane with the much more business class set up of 1x2x1 avoid this route. It was  a let down.";NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-01-10;" |  After a gap of almost 15 years, I booked a return ticket from Paris CDG to Bangkok via Hong Kong, as I was curious to see what had changed. A first inconvenience occurred when, for the return journey, I was rebooked from BKK to HKG on an earlier flight, without any explanation, this causing a much longer connecting time in HKG while waiting my flight back to Paris. The day of my departure from Paris happened to be the maiden flight of A350 between CDG and HKG. The plane was full, and, for the reason of late cargo loading, we got 55 minutes delay. At this moment, while still on the ground I knew my connecting flight to BKK would be missed. When arriving in HKG, 12 hours later, a new boarding pass was swiftly given to me, with an attached voucher reaching the generous value of a hamburger at any airport Mc Donald’s. I had to wait 4 hours instead of 75 minutes in terminal. A bit disappointed on this situation, its handling of passenger being a little careless. Besides this not-so-good story, everything went smoothly. Cabins clean and cabin crew delivering a top quality service, efficient and professional. The attendants were well groomed, responsive and pleasant. CX catering, if compared to Emirates, is a little below in term of product, but the food is tastier, aiming at natural non-sophisticated dishes, rather than fancy bland food, and wine is served in generous portions. The IFE is satisfactory, with a decent variety of movies and TV shows. Comfort inflight is correct for economy class. Seat configuration 3-3-3 on 777’s and A350, and seat pitch is good. I regret that footrests have disappeared. Similarly, no longer hot towels and amenity kits in economy class. I would not applaud the ergonomy of meal trays, slipping on tablets, with not well stackable cups, and equipped with plastic cutlery instead of stainless (by the way, spreading butter with such curved knives is a real challenge for a left-handed like me). By and large, I can still recommend Cathay Pacific on the Asia-Europe route. But, being not at lower price, CX should take care, in such highly competitive market, to give a little more than competitors, even small things. ";POSITIVE

Outbound on an older Boeing 777 with the tired regional configuration but the seats were quite comfortable. Service from welcome drink to meal service impeccable, but IFE lacking compared to what is listed on their website. Mixed feelings on the more modern inbound segment with the new A350 in the newer small suite configuration. Meal service much better and full complement of IFE. However, the staff did not have health declaration forms available which we had to fill up after deplaning causing delay in exiting the terminal, and it caused quite a backup of passengers exiting the plane. In all, an expensive product but well worth the pampering.";POSITIVE

There were two porters that took the bags and a very nice and smiley agent completing the check in process within 1 minute. As I arrived slightly late at the airport, she walked me to the entrance of security and asked a more junior colleague to take me through security. The staff that accompanied me was not that necessary as we did not have to jump any queue. Hong Kong Airport must have the world's most efficient security screening and although there were quite a lot of people, the security and immigration process took less than 10 minutes. Did not have time to visit the lounge and once on board, the cabin crew asked me where my seat was and she immediately addressed me by my name. A very comfortable pyjamas, slippers, elaborate AESOP amenities kit were given out. Amuse bouche and champagne was served before take off. A restaurant style menu board was given as the senior crew member introduced himself followed by the junior crew refilling the champagne. Once off, they came round to take order for the late night supper which consisted of caviar, salmon, an extensive choice of Western and Chinese food. I was not hungry and ordered only a Chinese soup which was hot and very flavourful. I must have looked very tired and the crew suggested me to go get changed and they would set up the bed for me. When I returned, my seat turned into a very comfortable and wide bed. The crew proposed a cup of camomile tea which I gladly accepted. I slept for a good 10 hours and when I woke up, other passengers were already having their breakfast. I was hungry and opted to have the full breakfast of fruit, toasts, cereal and dim sum - quality comparable to many restaurants in Hong Kong. I asked the crew if I could have more toasts as I was still hungry, they proposed some scramble eggs or a bowl of wonton noodles for me. At the end, I had a hard boiled egg in a bowl of delicious wonton noodles. The cabin crew on this flight were classy but friendly and approachable at the same time, they give out the feeling that they were genuinely happy to have you travelling with them.

Champagne was offered twice before takeoff and once leveled out, they came with another round of drinks followed by a meal.

Bangkok to Hong Kong sector was operated was a slightly older Boeing 777-200 but with a refreshed cabin. Cabin crew was enthusiastic as per Cathay's standards and exceeded my expectations for a 2-hour flight. Since I haven't experienced a ""regular"" Economy seat in a while now (I normally book bulkhead seats), I was shocked (in a good way) as to how much leg room there actually is. It's amazing how an extra inch of pitch can make a difference in flight. Hong Kong to Vancouver on a 1-year old 777-300ER, and honestly, it was my best experience of all the trips I've made on this sector. I reckon the majority of the crew are Vancouver-based, which I have noticed from the diversity of nationalities, as well as more attentive service as a whole. I'm not saying those of Hong Kong-based are inferior, but I definitely find the latter tend to rush the service a little. With that being said, this flight was excellent. FAs were responding to requests promptly, also going out of their way to give more than expected. Pushback and taxiing at Hong Kong were early, as the captain was trying to make up time for the surprisingly long flight time (11 hr 40 min, compared to the usual 10 hr 30 min). Despite the early departure, the flight was 30 minutes late into Vancouver, none of which are Cathay's fault as all flights from Asia were delayed coming in that day.

For food one can choose between the western and the asian option (mostly chinese and thai): I choose mostly asian and was not disappointed. The seats have the same quality standard on the 777 (from Milan to Hong Kong) and the latest A350 (from Hong Kong to Auckland). For me the only difference between the two aircrafts were the slightly bigger windows in the A350 and the onboard camera on the top tail on the A350 . The Movie selection is one of the best.

cathay-pacific-airways;2017-01-01;" |  Dusseldorf to Hong Kong. Having had high expectations, my first business class flight with Cathay was somewhat disappointing in terms of service. The new business class seats are great, providing great privacy and space. However, the inflight service could be improved. Dinner service started late and took a long time. Also, being in the last row of business (there are two rows in a separate cabin just in front of premium economy) meant that the food was almost cold by the time it got to us. Service attention was patchy - tea for breakfast was served long after the tray was put down. Maybe it was that we were in the ""forgotten"" area, but it really was not a service experience that I would expect from all the things I had heard about Cathay. Also, the fact that premium economy passengers get to use the business class lavatories means a great deal of disturbance being seated on the alley. And lastly, having almost 5 minutes of advertising before the inflight entertainment starts, is a bit much, in my view. Watching TV series meant having to fast-forward every time. And, lastly, the question whether business class passengers should pay for Wifi access or not - or should at least have one hour for free. All in all, little things that could be improved on easily, but they do make the difference between good and great service.";POSITIVE

Finally find time to call hotline and said kids meal needs to be requested 24hrs before, I missed this by 1.5hrs. Talked to supervisor, nothing can be done but heard my complaint. Frustrated but not choice. No kids meal for a 3yr old and a 5 yr old. My flight was delayed by 30 minutes. Return flight also delayed even the flight departed on time from Taipei. On my return very disappointed again. I got response after my post and since I was overseas, I requested to follow up call after my return which Cathay did even thought it was 1 day later than what I have requested. The customer hotline lady and the supervisor I spoke to never mention about using the so called ""manage my booking"" function in the website to request for meal. As a matter of fact, how could I as a customer knows such tricks in your website? I am a customer, not an expert in your website. You should make your website informative to allow me to do so. To continue, my wife follow customer hotlines to online check in for our return trip and not able to find way to request for kids meal. I received call from your complaint staff. Equally disappointed and mentioned the same thing to use the so called ""manage your booking"" to request for kids meal. She also mentioned the agent who booked our ticket might not request for kids meal.  What make it worst is your complaint staff didn't even know which flight I took, date and my Marco Polo ID which I have provided to the customer service hotline. The customer hotline supervisor promised to forward me complaint to the complaint department which clearly didn't happen. ";NEGATIVE

When I took that seat, the screen was positioned in such a way that I could not watch movie unless I moved my body forward away from the seat.

Whatever happened to Cathay's ground staff in Vancouver isn't good and should be fixed immediately. Barely any smiles or greetings for frequent flyers and seemed ignorant to all requests and questions. My flight was delayed by 45 minutes and I asked if I could be moved my connecting flight to Bangkok in order to ensure both me and my bags make it. I got a response of ""No, the flight still shows on-time arrival. You will have plenty of time, plus, since you have a tight connection, your bags will be off-loaded first."" From previous experiences, any delays when flying against the jet stream through the Pacific Ocean mean extra delays, which is exactly what happened on this flight. Flight time to Hong Kong from Vancouver was 14 hours, approximately an hour longer than usual. Landed Hong Kong 45 minutes late, and I had to run for my life across the busy terminal to make my connection to Bangkok. I asked the ground staff at the gate in Hong Kong to check if my luggage has made it and by the time the flight was closing, they still ""weren't able to locate my bags"". I was discouraged and accepted the fact that my bags were going to miss the flight yet again. Landed in Bangkok on time, one of my bags showed up which was a blessing but the other took a later flight and got delivered to my house. Economy seats on the Boeing 777-300ER are great, one of the best in the industry in fact. While I was rushing to board my flight to Bangkok, which was operated on the Airbus A350-900 (exciting!), my boarding pass got an error message and hence I got upgraded to Premium Economy Class for the flight. The A350 cabin is by far one of the best in the skies nowadays and Cathay Pacific has properly defined the meaning of ""Premium Economy"" perfectly: the extra legroom, the seat amenities, the IFE, just to name a few. Food was amazing for Economy, edible and appropriate portions. Advice: Don't get the pasta unless you really have to. Go with the Western or Asian menu. Cabin crew service continues to be top notch on both flights, especially on the short-haul from Hong Kong to Bangkok. They really do care about their frequent fliers, so Vancouver ground staff, step it up! Overall, a pleasant experience, with a few flaws here and there that could be fixed with a smile or two.";POSITIVE

Food was very average and had a hard time asking for additional bread with the meal. Desserts are very poor choice and would have been better off in economy. IFE is very good and a good up to date movies. Flatbed seat is narrow compared to Qatar Airways but had good legroom when lying flat. HKG to CEB was sadly delayed as they decided to change the plane and once we boarded this seemed an old plane as the interior was very tired had seen better days.

It was not until 6:30 that announcement was made to abandon the flight due to a technical problem. The flight was re-scheduled for 9pm and took off at around 9:30. The compensation is that the boarding pass is worth HKD75 for a meal but that at HKG airport can buy nothing more than a hamburger. We arrived in Beijing well after midnight and my land connection were ended for the day. I can check in at the airport hotel only after 2am. Yes, they did say 'sorry', but they don't even mean it. I am resentful that we are kept in the cabin for 2 hours - perhaps to prevent passengers to rebook an earlier flight? A nightmare of a flight.

The ground staff at Melbourne and Tokyo were exceptional, however, the airline itself I was disappointed with. The staff were more interested in getting their job done than customer service. We were sitting at the back and they served our meals last, but within a few minutes they came around to collect the meal trays which is not a good experience for slow eaters. The seat on the Boeing 777-300 was really comfortable, I liked how it was tall and that there was a remote, but the TV kept getting stuck. The seat on the A330-300 was bad, the seat was short which means tall people can't sleep comfortably. Also, the inflight entertainment was bad with very few selection, unlike other airlines, like Emirates. The food was terrible and I couldn't eat some of the meals at all.

At Cathay, despite you paying a very high price for a ticket and having the highest loyalty card tier, the flexibility of ground staff on luggage and seating is zero.

Although I miss the old Dragonair logo, the transition between the two airlines has become almost seamless. On Cathay Dragon to HKG, the business class was configured in a 2x2x2 layout. The seats were very comfortable and I appreciated the new streamlined tray tables and side seat pocket. The food was dim sum, which was good but nothing spectacular. The rose flavored prosecco cocktail handed out during boarding was very good, and I enjoyed the choice of wines. Service was quite standard, but I felt that there were too many flight attendants for such a small business class section, giving the sensation of lots of people buzzing around the cabin. On the way back, the flight was operated by Cathay Pacific and featured the 1-2-1 herringbone layout which I much preferred for the privacy. Food was great - I had the sweet and sour fish and champagne. However, if I had one complaint it was again there were too many FAs in business class, making the aisles appear crowded. The departure lounge at SHA was also a disappointment but that's more on Shanghai Hongqiao airport rather than Cathay. Generally, I look forward to flying Cathay/Dragon because I know I can expect high standards of cleanliness and service.";POSITIVE

I paid for Premium Economy onboard an A340-300 but due to an equipment change we were rebooked onboard regional business class on a Boeing 777-300. As a OWE member I used the Pier First class lounge which was superb, really enjoyed it there and dined on a three course lunch and several glasses of Verve Clicquot champagne. We boarded via the priority queue 30 minutes before departure. We were warmly welcomed onboard and seated in 14A and 14C and the seats were recliners arranged 2-3-2. On sitting down we were offered drinks, I took a glass of Billicart Salmon champagne. The menu on offer was: king prawn and asparagus salad, followed by a choice of pork noodle soup, beef and orzo pasta or a tea set. We chose the latter two between us and both were decent rather than good. Hagen Das ice cream was offered for dessert. I also had a further three refills of champagne which was most welcome. There was a good choice of films and I watched Independence Day 2 and an episode of Family Guy. My wife was asked to fill in a passenger survey. She was given a $HK50 onboard duty free voucher for completing this, however it wasn't used as a minimum spend was $HK600. We arrived on time and immigration was swift.

The bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. IFE was sufficient but not so up-to-date. However, food options are limited and are always repeating on North America flights.

In particular, the new economy seating is great and comfortable in the upright position but for me is very uncomfortable when you try to recline it. I landed up with my seat upright, whilst the person in fron on both legs put their seat fully back. The trouble with that is that then I could no longer see the screen for entertainment, and my leg room virtually disappeared. The first leg overnight was also very hot, everyone was complaining about it. The food was reasonable but as a decent sized westerner, I landed up getting hungry by the time the next meal was served. Not too sure what the point is of supplying a tray with empty plastic boxes on it, like someone had removed some food for cost cutting. Overall, it wasn't very nice and not looking forward to the return leg.

Flight departed 15 minutes late to arrive 30 minutes early. Was surprised to find by myself that my connection flight in Hong Kong changed and was not the one announced aboard, had a free walk around HK airport for that, I was fortunate that I had two hours to walk to my next flight as I wanted to stretch my legs. Booked low fat meal: got steamed cod and veggies with rice with both appetizers and desserts as meal, baked apples with raisins as breakfast with toasted bread. Was tastier than it sounds. While my meals were provided with water, I could still ask for the other drinks every passenger is allowed to ask for, and got one strawberry ice cream. As snacks, there were peanuts, crisps/chips, apples and instant noodles. On the short HK-Taipei flight, I was given a chickpea pie, and a chickpea sandwich on my way back. Got lucky enough to be upgraded to premium thanks to the Chinese new year rush, so I could compare the premium and the regular economy classes. Only difference is leg room, a few discount vouchers to expensive stores and armrests, along with earplugs and blindfolds. I was still fine with regular leg room though, only missed the airplugs and blindfold on my way back. While the seat does get hard after a few hours, I still felt a bit more comfort than Eva Air despite the stopover. Also, the movie selection was nice. No problem with air crew.

I requested the lady at check-in to help my parents find another flight as they cannot stay in airport for 26 hours. She assured me that my parents will be taken care, with no options left I had to depart them. Now the nightmare just began, on arrival the wheel chair staff took my parents are asked them to wait for 30 minutes - they waited and no one arrived. The airline information counter indicated that the connecting flight was cancelled because of few bookings and asked my parents to check with lounges for availability.

Great on the flight and then spotted us looking confused searching for the arrivals lounge in HG airport, so took us there, above and beyond. HKG-MEL a few days later. New Pier lounge is fantastic. Large, many seating options, many food options, very good cocktail bar. Departure 00.05 so ate in the lounge, followed by cheese and wine on the plane. This was served promptly so sleep could be maximized. Good five hours sleep. Lights on 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast, and this is service complaint again. Served orange juice and coffee, then nothing for 30 minutes, then fruit and muesli then nothing for 30 minutes then omelette. The gap is too large. First coffee all drunk before any food and no top up offered. I asked 4 times for more coffee over an hour, so gave up and went for my own from the galley. This may sound picky, but this is a premium cabin, should not have to ask, and if I do, then it should be brought promptly. The food is just not good enough, especially the steak/Chilli Chicken (MAN-HG). Food is consistent, not good, over 7 flights now. We had better food on Thomson Airways Premium Economy in February, which is saying something.

Cabin crew serve Premium Economy food, and then continue into Economy, and eventually return to collect trays. They are rarely seen between meal times. Service and food standards are now virtually the same as Economy, but the fare is marked up 200-300% - a big difference for about 40% more space.

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-10-22;"Recently, I travelled from Kolkata to New York JFK twice - once through Doha on Qatar Airways and the second time through HKG on Cathay Pacific. Gave me an opportunity to compare the business class product on two well regarded One World airlines. Qatar Airways uses Boeing 787 on CCU-DOH route - a much superior aircraft compared to the A320 that is operated by Cathay Drgaon on the CCU-HKG run on behalf of Cathay Pacific. The aircraft on the longer haul - DOH-JFK and HKG-JFK for both airlines is the Boeing 777-300. However, the seating layout on Cathay Pacific is 1-2-1 and in the herring bone format offering unmatched privacy. In contrast, the 777-300 on Qatar was 2-2-2 format with no privacy whatsoever. With the option of meals on request, throughout the duration of the flight, cabin attendants were scurrying up and down the aisles serving food and removing plates and table cloths, lights coming up, glare from the entertainment screen.  Flight attendants on both airlines are attentive, speak good English.  The entertainment systems were quite comprehensive on both segments of Qatar Airways but only so on Cathay's HKG-JFK segment. An ipad was provided on CCU-HKG sector. Amenities bags were provided on all segments. Quality and portions of food are comparable and both airlines offer a complement of international drinks. Schedule - Qatar leaves CCU at the unearthly hour of 3:30 at night. Cathay's departure is slightly more sensible at just past 1 an night. The transit time at both hubs - DOH and HKG are similar - and the overall journey is slightly faster on Qatar Airways by an hour or so. The flights were all on schedule. Transiting  Hong Kong is a more relaxing and well-organized airport to transit though a bus carried us between two terminals. The security check had no crowds. Doha presented a picture of huge crowds, the security check area looked frantic. The flight announcement board was crammed with information that it was impossible to locate your connecting flight gate.  I found the Wings lounge very appealing  from the range of food and drinks to the reliability of the wi-fi service to the cleanliness of the shower facilities. I used the lounge at Doha to escape the crowd, did not try the food or the showers, but it was comfortable though the wi-fi service was spotty. The fare is comparable and you can earn miles on both airlines by being a OneWorld member. So, overall, while both airlines offered a good quality product, I give a slight edge to Cathay Pacific -- for departure time, transfer at Hong Kong, and the privacy offered by the cabin layout. It does take a little bit longer to fly through Hong Kong than through Doha and while Qatar's 787 is a splendid plane, you cannot really enjoy it - you board the aircraft and go to sleep as soon as the plane takes off, but you do get to sleep on the flat bed seat, an option not available on Cathay Dragon's standard business seat in its A320.";POSITIVE

HK to London Gatwick on new A350, so quiet, so beautiful, wonderful business class seat/bed, superb TV, I can watch straight away before take off. After a light meal, I thought I would try and get some sleep, to my utmost surprise I slept for 8 hours and woke up in time for breakfast.

CX's regional seats are fixed back seats, thus proving very uncomfortable for a red-eye 4.5 hours flight. Inflight entertainment audio jack malfunctioned, although fixed by cabin crew after 30 minutes. Extremely poor catering, only a snack box (a tiny sandwich, chocolate brownie, fruits and a piece of shortbread) was provided, as opposed to full warm meal for a daytime flight on the same route. No choice of drinks, only a 250mL box of lemon tea, no water, tea, coffee etc. Arrived at Narita on time, but walk from gate to immigration is extremely long, nearly 10 minutes.

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-10-10;" |  Flew Cathay Pacific from Hong Kong to London Heathrow. First time in Premium Economy. Is it worth it? Yes and No. Firstly the good points. Seat is slightly larger, with 38 inch pitch, reclines 8 inches. Food Prawn or Lamb, not usual Chicken or Beef. You get a menu, wine is served from the bottle. TV screen is larger. Lights go off quicker than economy. Bad points, is it worth 3x the price?, depends on how full the plane is, if it is empty in economy then probably no. Configuration of 4 seats in middle is poor, economy 3 seats. The seat pitch could be more, Cathay used to have 34 inch pitch in economy, now 31 inch, so 3x for an extra 3 original inches is not good, buying two seats in economy would give you more room. Interesting class of seat, not all airlines offer.";POSITIVE

On reaching Hong Kong we are told that there is not enough time to transfer the luggage and therefore we will be rerouted to Singapore and then to Melbourne reaching there the next day morning at 6:20 instead of originally reaching at 22:50. The ground staff were absolutely unapologetic about this and the lady at the 6th floor airline service centre was rude when I inquired further whether my son could use the lounge because we were not prepared for this longer stay at the airport. This is pathetic customer service from Cathay pacific. Really a do not care attitude. This is the last time I'm traveling by Cathay Pacific.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-10-03;"We chose Cathay as we wanted premium economy for the leg room and the Qantas flight to Shanghai does not offer premium economy for some reason. The Qantas option would have been our preference as it did not require a stop in Hong Kong. Flight was on time and service was professional though not outstanding. Seats were adequate as was legroom though the footrest was not as comfortable or well designed as the Qantas seat. Food was again adequate but not outstanding. Unlike Qantas and Virgin, we were not acknowledged by name (a minor point admittedly) and were not offered a cup of tea/coffee at the end of the meal on the return flight. We can only compare premium economy to Qantas and Virgin Australia and Cathay comes off in third place due to seats and service. In our opinion Qantas premium economy is way out in front due to seat design, food quality and service. On a recent trip from Johannesburg to Sydney we experienced the most outstanding service we have ever had and one of the most comfortable flights out side of business class. Cathay did not come up to this standard and it was probably a waste of money for premium for a 9 hour flight. The return flight fromHong Kong to Sydney was no different. On the plus side, flights were on time, plane clean and relatively new looking. Airport check in was courteous and efficient and our Qantas status allowed us to utilise lounges through the One World alliance.";NEGATIVE

Although the crew was struggling with a broken bathroom light, a slow coffee-machine and a new layout in the galley, dinner was served shortly after take-off. I had the chicken and vegetables ""Mott 32"" signature dish and was not disappointed at all. Actually it has been one of the best inflight-meals since a long time. In general the quality of food out of Hong Kong seemed to have improved. The aircraft itself is very quiet, I hardly noticed it taking off from the runway. My seat was just next to the toilet and behind the galley but thanks to the noise-surpressing headphones I could not hear a thing and managed to sleep through the night just before breakfast service started. But the highlight on the A350 is its inflight-entertainment system, especially the various flight tracking maps (with view into the cockpit, side-views etc.) and the possibilty to switch on the two cameras (front and on top of the aircraft) simultanousely. I wished that flight had lasted a little bit longer.";POSITIVE

I normally fly BA on this route as they are priced better, but now Cathay Pacific matches it with a similar fare. Cathay Pacific seats are much better, fishbone 4 across against British Airways 8 seats across which results in narrow seats. But departure at T3 is less good. The lounge at Heathrow called No 1 is probably No 1 from last, and crowded. No match for the standard of Cathay, a 5-star Airline.";POSITIVE

Flight due to arrive at 8pm,  dinner starts served at 5:45, probably for the convenience of crew but inconvenient for passengers eating so early. 4 crew member serves 24 passengers in business class is adequate and need not be so 'hurried'.

Check in fast and friendly, Lounge No 1 isn’t as bad as I feared but food is very limited. Arrive at departure gate exactly 35 mins prior to departure and I just walked straight onto my flight. A brand new A350 with a gorgeous modern cabin, a good start so far, I settle into my new business class seat and noticed a much larger TV, superior remote control and the seat seem to have a little more padding and a little bit wider. I found I can watch a movie before take off unlike the B777, I also found a more detailed flight map, flight details and two outside cameras. I settle into my sleep blanket which actually work just like a sleeping bag, a clever idea. A high standard of food and excellent cabin staff, the cabin pressure and air conditioning is much improved. Arrived at HK 15 mins early and after an hour and a half the same plane took me to Manila, arriving 5 minutes early. By the way on all four segments of this flights not once did my ears felt uncomfortable.";POSITIVE

The business class offering from Cathay Pacific is superb. At HK airport I got access to several lounges spread through the airport. My favourite being The Wing. The flight itself was excellent. Extremely courteous and efficient FAs. I think that the business class seats in Cathay are as good as some first class seats on some airlines. The seat fully reclined to a flat bed with ample space to stretch. Im 5'7"" by the way. The 1-2-1 configuration means all seats get aisle access and you don't feel claustrophobic, which you do on some of the other airlines that have a 2-2-2 configuration. All in all a great flight.

Vomiting and diarrhoea for most of the 8 hour flight. We had already been on a long flight from Manchester to HK and began to feel unwell as we boarded the second flight. We only had 1.5 hour transfer at HK airport and we did not eat or drink there. We advised the cabin crew on arrival in Sydney (I had vomited in bathroom as plane taxied on runway) and although concerned to hear it they did not make any report or follow up. On getting home from the airport my husband then spent 2 days in bed, and I spent 24 hours. We felt unwell for several days. We contacted customer services and provided completed forms, as requested. We received acknowledgement of the forms (2 weeks after the flight) and were advised that the forms would be sent to the catering team and we would hear back. 5 weeks on from the flight and we are still waiting for feedback. We had expected that with a potential food issue there would be prompt action. Unfortunately this has not been the case. This is our first experience with Cathay and we had expected it to be a quality experience. We are extremely disappointed with the poor customer service and will not be travelling with this airline again.";NEGATIVE

From Hong Kong to Toronto, we were provided with small amenity bags from GOD (a local Hong Kong brand) containing earplugs, socks, and a sleeping mask. The extra leg room, roomier armrests, and noise-canceling headphones were much appreciated during the almost 15-hour long flight (18 hours including the transfer from Shanghai). Although the meal itself was the same as the one in economy, our trays had metal cutlery and a small tablecloth, which was a nice touch. We were also provided with some bubbly prior to take off. In my opinion, Cathay has the best value-for-money in their Premium Economy, and eases the discomfort of long-haul travel by quite a bit.";POSITIVE

But on the other hand, the cabin crew are very nice. The meal on this flight are very delicious, there is a variety to choose. The inflight entertainment have also a huge choice.

Assistance was arranged to get us quickly through the airport and we made the domestic flight with minutes to spare (a near record - 45 mins from touch down to take off, including a 10 minute walk between terminals. CX's food is generally good and it was a nice touch to be offered chopsticks to go with Asian food. Water bottles were replenished throughout the flights too.

The flight was good, though the Airbus A340 is long in the tooth and the herring bone style seats make one feel very hemmed in and also have very little storage space. Entertainment options are by no means as comprehensive as Emirates and there is no ability to send messages between seats. Hong Kong was a positive joy with swift transfers and a delightful stop at the Pier Lounge, which has to rank as one of the best anywhere. Different themed eating areas, a stylish bar, great showers and heaps of space. Business Class on the Boeing 777 was a marked improvement in terms of space and storage and had a good night's sleep.

Flight from Toronto delayed 45 minutes. although I was devastated as it was a red-eye (and at that point I had been up all day), I was also delighted as the delayed would shortened my layover of the original 4.5 hrs in Hong Kong. However, flight boarded only 25 minutes past scheduled and departed 10 minutes earlier than the new delayed time. Very smooth flight with superb cabin service. I must say the cabin crew seemed kind of frantic through out the flight but they fulfilled my expectations. Mid-flight drinks and cup noodles came about every hour, with prompt response after request bell. The food - dinner was alright, with my favourite couscous appetizer and the rice dish, which looked pretty ordinary but tasted amazing. Breakfast was a complete surprise. It was the first time I've flown any airline and had edible scrambled eggs, cooked perfectly with potatoes and sausage on the side. Short-haul to Bangkok on a full 3-class Boeing 777-300ER (a surprise of aircraft on a regional route), service was definitely a little more rushed due to the short flight time, but the professionalism was still there.

It's a rare occasion when I have seen their ground staff smile or try and make an effort to connect with the passengers, and the in-flight staff has similarly stopped any pretense at courtesy it feels like. And if you are traveling with small children, it is almost inevitable that they would be subject to extra rigourous seat belt safety protocols. The recent overhaul of their Marco Polo rewards is also extremely disappointing, with even small benefits like the lounge access or priority baggage handling getting dearer and dearer.

Also, is it even hygienic having all the exposed food with the crew member standing directly over it talking to passengers as she progresses down the aisle. Give me the 1 on 1 delivery anytime as with most carriers, much more personalised. You are offered bread once, then have to request any more later (bread basket should be brought through several times during meal as with most other airlines). What other airline does not provide salt and pepper on the meal tray? I had to ask as I thought it was just a missed item on my tray but was told you have to ask for it. My rack of lamb consisted of 2 of the smallest lamb cutlets possible (overcooked and dry) with a spoonful of risotto and 1 cherry tomato.  The sea bass was also terribly overcooked and barely warm.

I believe that European low cost airlines have bigger recline than this ""premium"" airline. As often happens with CX the food was not good for western's taste. And as often happens they underestimated (or under communicate) the actual scale of the delay, being almost one hour longer than officially stated. From a premium airline I expect more.";NEGATIVE

We checked in at Jakarta separately. One of us received a surprise upgrade for the flight leg HK-LAX.  It was a pleasant surprise and great start for the start of the trip for her. As friends all of us were happy of her but a tad bit jealous of her luck. So while transiting in HK, I decided to ask the lady at boarding counter if there are any possibilities of getting free upgrade and the remaining 3 of us were given the same upgrade to business class as well. CX has won our hearts.  On the return flight we sat on the premium economy seats, and the seat was comfortable, wide and the leg space is abundant. Service was awesome, the staff was very polite and helpful throughout the flight. ";POSITIVE

Red-eye flight between Hong Kong and New York Kennedy with a stopover in Vancouver. Transit passengers from HKG boarded prior to passengers departing from YVR through a gate with partition in between. Boarding for YVR-originating passengers was a bit hectic, and gate agents were running around trying to get priority boarding completed before general boarding began. I was granted priority boarding, thanks to the benefits of their frequent flyer program. I was greeted with enthusiasm and warmth by the purser, a great way to start a trip. Business Class was very empty, Premium Economy was almost full, and Economy was 80% full (a lot of the middle seats were empty). Personally, I felt like the crew were able to provide a more comfortable service, as there was no hassle to get through the meal service. Choice of food were either rice with chicken in a black bean sauce, or braised beef with mashed potatoes. I went with the rice option, and needless to say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had on CX. Flight departed YVR and landed in JFK ahead of schedule. My bags were the first ones dispense, so I was able to get out of the airport fairly quickly. I can't wait to fly with them again in July.";POSITIVE

The flight left SFO at 1:30 am. and after an hour, around 2:30 am, they began to serve drinks and then dinner, it is not practical. After drinks they should have just served some light snacks. Who wants to have dinner at 2:30 am? Its obvious people were not hungry and eager to sleep, so most of the passengers wasted the good food. then after that there was no food service. only juice was served every hour or so quietly so as not to disturb the sleep. Around 6 or 7 in the morning (SF time), people were getting hungry and all that they had available was apples and chips and cookies. Thats the time when everyone needed a good breakfast! Then just one hour before landing they served breakfast, which was around 4 am Hong Kong time (destination). there was hardly any time before landing, so people had to eat hurriedly. This is quite absurd. They need to serve meals at appropriate timings. Someone needs to tell them that. The toilets were being cleaned regularly, but with a full capacity flight the trash bins were almost always full and overflowing! The flight was full but the checkin staff did not make any effort to allot seats together for families, many seats were pre-booked and many family members had to sit separately throughout the 13 hour flight. When family tickets are booked, they should have a system by which seats should be pre-alotted together.";POSITIVE

That wasn't really that much of the problem, but they knew it 4h before that there would be several travelers which had to stay or catch other flights to their final destinations and they came up with no solution. We entered the arrival hall where Cathay Personal should take care of us. Well it was just a pure chaos. They had no clue or some of them even didn't new that we missed our plane. 2-3h later (01.30pm) they had finally a solution. I didn't excpect this. The following day we were not able to take our seats next to each other. We finally just had to watch for ourselfs where we gonna sit.

Granted the seats are quite neat and you get a little luxury compared to the tightly packed economy. But I feel that food and service is actually not much better than what you receive in economy. They offered me a drink just before take off. They handed me one bottle of water shortly before serving me food. I did not want a full blown meal at 2 am and asked for the light option which was advertised as soup. But instead they gave me a disgusting salad with some fruit in a dish. Ate the fruit and left everything else. After sleeping for the best part of the journey the next offering after only three visits was offer of juice and tea. Followed closely by breakfast offering. Thankfully recognise able in the form of scrambled egg with hash brown and a streak of bacon. Shortly followed by another offering of juice. I asked for tea which never appeared. That was that. Am I expecting too much? Family flew economy on the way out with me and from what they told me they had more attention and food / drink offerings than me. Something not quite right here.

I've now come to realise that most people who leave reviews are doing so because of a problem, so it doesn't indicate the overall satisfaction. With our four flights with Cathay from Brisbane to Paris via Hong Kong, the only issue we encountered was a one hour, twenty minute delay out of Amsterdam which was not at all the airlines fault anyway. The leg room was great (we are 5'9 and 6'3 so this is important), the food was fantastic, service was mostly good (with the exception of one or two sour hostesses), inflight entertainment was excellent and price was great.

Boarding is a bit chaotic while all business class, first class and diamond status passengers used one boarding line. My seat was 2A. The 1A and 2A seats have better privacy than the middle and window seats on right side. Cathay only has 6 First class seats on its 777 with 2 cabin crews. So the service was exceptionally attentive and crews were trying their best to make journey as pleasant as possible. After take off, food was served starting with caviar, followed with salat and fish. Food was fantastic together with Krug champagne and superb wines. The little welcome card on dish tray written by crews is surprisingly warm. The bed in Cathay is one of the most comfortable. The seat was converted into a wide bed when I changed in to the PJs. The mattress topper makes the bed even more comfy. I had a very sound 9 hours sleep before aircraft touching down at LHR. It was my best first class experience.

The other passengers make it a let-down flight but cannot fault Cathay Pacific on service. Flight took off late due to late passengers - missing our push back time, and also our number in the queue, but they still landed ahead of schedule. Other airlines are not as forgiving with what time you should be at the gate, and they definitely need to impose stricter rules. Food was great (same as Economy). Seat pitch and leg space generous. Staff were great, however one was slightly lacking manners compared to the others. HK - London. Another full flight and the staff coped very well considering. A shame that airlines do not have other restrictions on hand luggage as when nearly every passenger brings on a hard shell suitcase, you are forced to have your bag under your seat for being the more considerate flier with a smaller bag. IFE was great. I have flown with CX quite a lot recently so I had already caught up with all the latest films but great selection overall. Food was great (Hagen Daaz is definitely a plus!), snacks available and they were prompt with all my requests. Seat pitch not bad. Leg space is OK, but if you have a lot in the front pocket, it is reduced somewhat. Landed ahead of schedule.

(Did not buy) I was at back of cabin by the bulkhead, seat 32A, Perth to HK. Continuous cool draft from three sides for whole flight meant this I was too cold to sleep even with 2 blankets and a newspaper under my shirt. Most people in PE appeared cold. My advice is to take a fleece in your carry-on. CP had several staff at Perth at the departure gate who have English as their first language. Why were the announcements done by someone who does not, who spoke extremely rapidly and was completely unintelligible?

The new Economy Class IFE is touchscreen-only but includes a USB port to charge my very thirsty phone. Seat pitch was pretty decent and the new Economy Class is certainly an improvement. Service was pretty good. Only pity is that they are one of the remaining airlines to stick with 20kg baggage allowance when most others in its league have moved to 30kg. But I think even their older planes are much better than Singapore Airlines B777s.

However I was disappointed from the ground up. At Chitose International Airport, boarding was chaotic: seat numbers/row numbers were not announced and this caused a long queue even prior to boarding. This is somewhat unnecessary and uncivilized. Food was bad: a sweet meat dish that I could not finish. Even more disappointing was there were no juice/beverage runs for the entire flight although it was nearly a five hour flight. I believe juice/beverage runs should be conducted on an hourly basis as it is dehydrating after a long flight. Service is rather perfunctory and impersonal.

Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive ‘economy’ ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of ‘economy’ and not a lot of ‘premium’. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago.

The stopover meant an extra 4 hours added to the journey, which meant I missed my connecting flight. On landing in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific staff were waiting to assist passengers with connecting flights. Amazingly they had already sorted out onward flights, new boarding passes and for those who had onward flights rearranged for the next day like me, they had already organised overnight accommodation and transfers.

I normally arrive early for refreshments at the Cathay lounge and it is one of the best, there being always a lot of food items available. The flight is OK but standard declines with this carrier.

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-04-11;" |  Hong Kong to London on Cathay Pacific. It was my first trip in Cathay First class so I chose seat 1A. This seat is almost like a secluded suite as the seat in middle opens on the other side. Cathay only has 6 First class pods on its 777 however there were only 2 passengers in the first class on my flight so the service we got was exceptional. The crew was very attentive and you could see they were trying to make an effort to make our journey as pleasant as possible. Little things like talking to me about my vacations and my job back in London was a nice change to the robotic Crew at the back of the plane in many airlines. Food was very nice. I ordered from the menu whenever I wanted something and the crew was happy to prepare it for me, in addition my drink was always filled up. The bed in Cathay is one of the most comfortable in the industry. While I went to change in to the PJs, my seat had been converted into a bed with an additional mattress on top. Similar while I was changing back into my clothes the seat was re-organised in my absence. The whole experience was very nice, from Check-in till landing. I will highly recommend Cathay if you have not tried it before.";POSITIVE

The seats have built-in TV's with a great selection of movies and shows. The cabin staff are very nice and attend to your requests right away. The only problem with the cabin staff is getting a hold of them, but once you do, they are eager to help you as much as they can. The worst part of the flight were definitely the seats which are adequate for a quick flight but become uncomfortable during a 18-hour flight. They do provide pillows and blankets for sleeping though which is nice. The food on the plane is good, but it's not a lot. They do have snacks and cup ramen upon request which is great, but it runs out about 1/2 through the flight.";POSITIVE

I took the window seat in the emergency row bulkhead behind the wing. 777-300 is a big enough plane that overall the cabin felt roomy and even elegant. Suspecting that I would be experiencing a tedious 14 hour flight, I didn't have high hopes, but the seat width was adequate, and nobody was seated next to me. I could stretch out. Cabin crew was courteous and attentive, but they didn't really seem to make much eye contact. Don't remember too many in flight announcements. Cabin overall quiet and comfortable. Plenty of good movies and games. Lots of newspapers. The only negatives I could observe were the bathrooms and the very very cold air coming out of the emergency slide door. I don't know where it comes from, but it was a constant draft once we got to cruise and I had to place my backpack there to prevent getting frostbite. Disembarked very quickly and even though we were all tired it was all smiles and not much trash. Very well maintained airline.";POSITIVE

CX Customer Service refunded me AUD$112 and did not even credit my FF account with premium points or status credits but at the much lower discounted economy rate. Funny I can not find a Premium fare that is only $112 more than an economy fare on the Cathay Pacific web site. I then filled in the complaint form online and there standard response ""Our team is currently reviewing your comments and, if necessary, one of our team members will contact you"" 14 days have passed and no contact from CX.

When I arrived the airport, I printed out the boarding pass and made sure that we picked the seats as what we chose during the online booking. When we got on the plane our seats were occupied. We asked the flight attendant for her help and she asked us to find any unoccupied seats to sit down as the plane was about to depart. I asked the flight attendant again and she said it would be fine. Later an old man with his family came and shouted that these seats were theirs and the man insulted us, even though we said the flight attendant was fixing the seat problem. If the plane is full and it should have no more vacant seats that can be chosen but I wonder why would the flight attendant ask us to sit any vacant seats as we liked. The staff is so poorly trained and it led us to be scolded by this uneducated old guy. I will never take this airline again!";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-03-20;"Red-eye flight from Hong Kong to Sydney - overall a very good flight with Cathay Pacific Airways. Check in was prompt and efficient, but boarding was chaotic - probably more due to airport procedures than the airline itself. Our carry-on luggage had to be inspected just prior to boarding for the second time, after passing through the security. It delayed boarding and in reality, it was a perfunctory opening the bag and casually looking through, without any additional benefits to security. The crew was at the usual Cathay standard, courteous and considerate. The food however, was a little disappointing. There was a great selection of movies and such. but I was sleeping for most of the flight. Drink and food service after take-off could have been more prompt (it was served about 1.5 hours after take-off) - which shortened the time available for sleep. The new business class lie-flat seats are pretty good, although still a little hard on the shoulders when sleeping on the side.";POSITIVE

I must congratulate the way in which the flight attendant managed the situation but it does bring home the point that airlines, including Cathay, need to be very careful how and who they choose to upgrade. The resultant dispute greatly upset all passengers in the cabin, including me of course. Add to this the constant problems I have with the Cathay website whenever I try to book some flights that are anything remotely complex (for example, 'multi-city') then I find I start to choose other airlines. Other than that the other flights were ok and the food was good - but not the wine. The evening return flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane is a winner due its very useful scheduling allowing one to get to bed before the next day in the office.

As for seat comfort, the old clam shell style seats they retained in their regional classes still is better compared to the new ones that recline down to your face. IFE impresses, and flight attendant service is good.  It's clear that they were cutting costs when it came to refreshment service. The usual sandwich has finally been revived but the juice box thing was never the Cathay I used to know.

Entertainment very average - not many up to date films available - not good outlay of seats when flying with partner - late take-off in Auckland on return journey - not given much information - very poor loading of passengers really should have economy getting on at another door poor that they have to go through business class first - what is the point of allowing business class on first. Also a little chaotic - sat on plane for another 3/4 hour with no information hence later getting into Hong Kong. Showers all full so really didn't get to see much of the lounges - did go into a lounge opposite gate 2 thank goodness I checked on the flight as they were loading passengers and hadn't made any announcements could easily have missed the flight. Needed to go to another lounge in Heathrow as Cathay Pacific one having refurbishment given invitation but when went to one lounge they told us that we couldn't come to the one although I showed them the invitation rather rude.

I suppose the only negative is the cabin staff are so ruthlessly efficient in how they go about their jobs, they often lack warmth and can be quite brusque with customers. Management do a marvelous job teaching their staff how to be efficient, next they should focus on teaching them to lighten up and be a bit warmer, perhaps even smile every now and then.

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-20;"Adelaide to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific Airways in December 2015. The flight was excellent, seats are great, the crew was efficient, pleasant and attentive. I thought the food was good and particularly enjoyed the pork noodle dish served for breakfast. Had the barramundi for lunch which was delicious as well. The IFE screen is a good size, touch screen was a bit slow to respond. A very enjoyable flight, highly recommended.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-19;"LHR-HKG and HKG-PER after a longer layover in HKG in January, LHR-HKG (night flight) on a Boeing 777-300ER, HKG-PER (day flight) on an A330-300ER, both in Business Class – flights on time or early and a very pleasant experience. FA’s friendly and attentive, present in the cabin without being obtrusive. I found the lie-flat seats to be very comfortable and the herringbone 1-2-1 arrangement on both planes great. While the seat on the A330 clearly showed some wear and tear, everything was in working order. Food out of LHR was ok without being great. Dinner was a rather bland lobster appetizer and salad, followed by a braised pork cheek with root vegetables (or Chinese stir fried beef or herb chicken breast or pumpkin pasta in cheese sauce), plus cheese, fruit and cake for dessert. Breakfast was a breakfast frittata (or apple pancake or chicken and mushroom congee). Full warn breakfast, but again not that convincing. Food out of HKG was much better. The halibut curry was of restaurant quality. Other choices were pork spare ribs or Australian beef tenderloin or pasta in a tomato basil sauce. Starter was Cajun prawn (good as well) and again various dessert choices. Second meal before landing was seafood pie (tasty) or beef noodle soup. The wines that I tried were good without being great. IFE (CX studio) was AVOD. responsive and with ok screens. Selection was varied, however a little light on new Western releases. Commercials before every selection were slightly irritating, but you could fast forward, so not a big deal. Constant commercials during the flight map were just irritating. Restrooms were kept clean throughout both flights – CX Lounge in LHR was closed for renovation. I used BA’s Galleries Lounge which in T3 is a comfortable and relaxing place with ok food and drinks - much better than the alternative option of the AA Admirals Club. Check in in HKG was fast and hassle-free with no lines. I used CX The Wing lounge, which is excellent with various service areas including a manned bar and a made to order noodle station. Overall a great product and my favorite airline on the Kangaroo route. The weakest part was the BA flight CX uses as a feeder to LHR, where I failed to see the Business Class experience.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-19;"Shanghai to Melbourne via Hong Kong and great Service with Cathay Pacific. This airline is first class for service, they look after you very well and the food is very nice. Good connections to many destinations around the world from Hong Kong. Highly recommend this airline.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-15;"Cathay Pacific economy class was disappointing. I had heard great things about Cathay Pacific before, so I was excited to try them out on a flight from Jakarta, Indonesia to Newark, USA, with a layover in Hong Kong. Overall, Cathay got me where I needed to go, but not comfortably. I don't think I'll be taking them again any time soon. I had a slight delay in both Jakarta and Hong Kong, but this was likely due to many people traveling that day and air control traffic.  I reached my destination around our expected arrival time and the flight was smooth. Ground service in Jakarta was perfectly nice, but the cabin service both from Jakarta to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Newark left much to be desired. The service on the Jakarta leg was much better, but it still took a while to get anything to drink. The staff were kind of smirky and not particularly nice, but not outright rude. However, the staff on the Hong Kong to Newark leg were much worse. I had an arm injury and had difficulty getting someone to help me store my bag overhead, eventually a kind fellow passenger helped, but the fact that there was a staff member right there who ignored my request for help irked me a bit. Then came the food service. It took so long to get anything to drink or eat. At one point I had to wait three hours for a cup of water, even after pressing the service request button several times. I think this is unacceptable. Two meals were served on this trip. The dinner option was okay, but the breakfast was awful, I couldn't even finish it. The chairs were pretty uncomfortable in economy. Usually I don't have much trouble falling asleep on airplanes, but my seats on Cathay were really uncomfortable for some reason. I'm a very short person, so leg room doesn't bother me much, but if you're taller, you will probably feel squeezed. On the other hand, the entertainment system was excellent. Although not as up-to-date as the ones on ANA and Singapore Airlines, which have controllers for games, the modes on Cathay had a wide selection of movies and TV shows, which helped keep me occupied while I couldn't sleep. I think it was the only part of the flight that really lived up to its hype. Cathay Pacific has a great reputation for flights around Asia. I can vouch for them getting you where you need to go and having a great entertainment system, but not for much else. I'm sure their business class is wonderful, but if you're an economy class flier, I would recommend checking somewhere else.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-14;"The first time I took Cathay Pacific Business Class and service was pretty good. The staff was friendly, food was good and the seats was quite wide. The entertainment was quite good, and I can sleep for just about 4 hours. Regional business Class of CX might be better than other airlines.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-14;"This was the return sector from Hong Kong to Manchester. While my expectations are somewhat managed in Economy, in that you always seem to be treated as the poor relation, Cathay, along with many other airlines, fail to give adequate room to Economy Passengers and again you have to wrestle with your fellow passengers to eat a simple meal. We had tried to upgrade a few times over the holiday, though the look on the faces of the staff were akin to ""Not over my dead body"" this wasn't going to happen. I even mentioned that I was not looking for a free, but a paid upgrade, though this was met with the same look. When we boarded the plane in Hong Kong, I noticed that there were spare extra leg room seats near the exit doors and this became a free for all and soon occupied by people who happily pointed out their allocated seat somewhere else. Even a family with small children seemed to meet the criteria of sitting in the exit seats. Cathay overall does what it says on the tin. They get you from A to B. Keep your expectations low and you won't be disappointed. Just an OK airline is my summation.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-13;"Cathay Pacific Airways from Sydney to Hong Kong. The food was lovely, it tasted really nice, IFE was very responsive and had a great selection of movies. The aircraft was very new and the seats were fantastic. The cabin crew were a mixed bag, some were lovely and smiling, some spoke bad English and looked as though they didn't want to be there. All in all, it's a pretty good airline but in my opinion overrated.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-11;"Frankfurt to Shanghai via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Stunning experience. The flight from Frankfurt to Hong Kong in business class with CX let me forget the long distance. The seat was spacious, extremely comfortable and in sleeping position offered me privacy and separation from other passengers. Food and beverages served outstanding, cabin staff was present but discreet. Entertainment program matched highest expectations. Outstanding was CX business lounge in HKK, with shower possibilities, a full equipped and clean and tidy bathroom and nice breakfast. Traveling CX in business was quite an experience and probably my best business class long distance flight experience so far.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-02-02;"My wife had broke her ankle he day before traveling back from the Philippines - 2 short journeys to HKG and then the long flight home. In the airport we had our wheel chair taken off us to go through security! My wife then had to hop around the airport until our flight, I asked if it would be possible to have extra leg room for my wife (we were not after a free upgrade) just so she could raise her leg. We were told no, there were none available. There were spare seats with extra leg room on the flight - I took note of these and when I put in my complaint (after standing in the isle for 2 hrs and being in the way) I was offered a seat with extra leg room. Very cross that they could and should have done more for a lady with a broken ankle - took a lot to get them to agree this, should have happened on the flight. We now have upgrades for next flight to be used within 1 year (as if we travel to HKG all the time).";NEGATIVE

The flight was supposed to depart at 3:15pm, allowing passengers to land Surabaya on the same day at 7:00pm. Finally, the flight was delayed for 11 hours. This made me have no choice but cancel all meetings on Monday. There was no weather condition problem in Hong Kong nor Surabaya. Cathay Pacific did nothing to help us, not arranging another flight or connecting us with other transit. ";NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-31;"Bangkok to Hong Kong and were impressed with Cathay Pacific from the start. We were transiting in Hong Kong (with a long wait at Bangkok) and the check-in assistant was very helpful. He even tried to get us onto an earlier flight. The cases were checked in right through to our final destination and all 3 boarding passes were issued and presented in a nice ""transit in Hong Kong"" folder. The flight was delayed by about 40mins but the the crew were very apologetic. The British Captain was very pleasant and informative and always kept us up to date. He even apologised for the rather turbulent flight but said we shouldn't be surprised as there was an 80mph wind on our tail. The aircraft was only a year old and was extremely modern and clean. The seats were very comfortable and had an excellent recline angle. The service was excellent. I was surprised that even on a short 2 hr flight there was a full meal and full entertainment service with in-seat screen. Wish we could fly with them again.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-30;"Frankfurt to Hong Kong and this Cathay Pacific flight was a pleasure. Check in at FRA was a very nice experience. This was a weekend lunchtime departure and the area at Frankfurt Airport near the gate was quiet, even though the retail areas of the airport were busy. The economy class seats on Boeing 777s are very good, and once aboard, I was able to sleep and work. The meals are good and I did not go hungry. On this flight they served lunch and breakfast. I would not say cabin service is great, but they did their job. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-30;"Hong Kong to Los Angeles on Cathay Pacific's 4-class Boeing 777-300ER was a nice flight and the seat was comfortable. The ground staff at the gate on this occasion ensure passengers kept to the correct queue by fare class pre-boarding.  As with any flight to the USA, the usual procedure at the departure gate is to have ground staff open bags and check the contents (again) of the cabin luggage after the ticket swipe. Boarding on Cathay long haul is usually reasonably quick once commenced. I chose a window seat toward the rear. For economy class, the seat width and pitch is ok, nothing to complain about, meaning better than normal. The meals are nice. Apart from specially ordered meals, Cathay normally give two cuisine options per meal: Chinese and Western, and an ice cream for desert. I usually choose the Chinese option. IFE choices on this occasion were adequate but not great. Cabin service was okay, they did what they were supposed to do.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-29;"Manchester to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Seat was comfortable once you get used to the angled layout in business class. Flight was 11 hours 25 minutes. Received one cocktail, one glass wine with meal and only one bread roll with meals. No refills offered. You had to ask for anything else, including water. Meals were lukewarm. Staff were friendly but functional. Disappointing service level compared to middle eastern carriers. Brand new aircraft, but no wifi.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-26;B-HLF. Flew Hong Kong to Manila with Cathay Pacific Airways. Tired cabin with lots of plastic and cloth instead of leather that was chapped and weathered. Very cramped seating and very short seats made it unusually difficult to tuck my bag under the seat. TV screen was tiny like a smartphone and slightly out of focus. Very limited movie and music selection. Departure gate required taking a train. Was disappointing to find that the online shopping catalogue does not match the inflight magazine range. In fact unlike the online catalogue there is no section dedicated to CX branded items - most of which although still advertised are long sold out. A few things that I did like however was the power plug which allowed me to recharge my phone. The docking area once in Manila which was very efficient. The efficiency of managing bookings online.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-26;Amsterdam to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. The staff were the asset. Comfortable seats but showing their age. Food selection was poor - all 3 choices contained mushrooms so seemed like little thought given to menus. Food quality dropped since last time I flew. Sadly it appeared this once great airline has been left behind. Our first leg with Qantas was far superior. 10/10 for staff.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-22;"Melbourne to London via Hong Kong, and my husband and I were delighted with the facilities and service provided by Cathay Pacific. From the moment we entered the aircraft, the customer service could not be faulted. We were handed a introductory champagne/cocktail (non alcoholic offered) on arrival. Soon after we were given bottles of water and a hot hand towel. Approx. 1 hour into the flight we were offered an excellent 3 course meal with nibbles and chocolates and coffee to finish. The seating pods were very modern with a seat reclinable to a flat bed with a thin duvet. We were also given a complimentary washbag with all necessary products. The inflight entertainment offered a wide choice of films, TV and radio programmes with high quality noise cancelling headphones. There was plenty of space to stow shoes, clothing, books etc. Towards the end of the meal we were offered a very generous breakfast. Snacks and drinks were available during the flight. The attendants on the flight were most welcoming and attentive at all times. An added benefit was being able to use the Cathay Pacific business lounge at the airports which again offered drinks and hot and cold food, showers (in Hong Kong) and quiet seating areas. I would highly recommend Cathay Pacific.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-21;"Hong Kong to Tokyo Narita with Cathay Pacific, and a perfect flight experience. Many check-in kiosks available so checked in quick. Various business lounges to visit at HKG. Once boarded, welcome drink was offered.  Unfortunately CX usually uses regional products into Tokyo Narita but long haul product to Tokyo Haneda, so my seat didn't recline fully. But based on the flight time, it was very good. Lunch was excellent! Where they offered everyone a breakfast, starter, main course and desert. If you can fly to Haneda because the seat can recline into a fully flat bed, but if you have to pay more than 1000HKD, go with Narita, they are fine!";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-21;"London to Brisbane via Hong Kong, and a last minute purchase at xmas meant the most expensive airline ticket I'd paid for. Cathay Pacific was still cheaper than the others. Flights selected gave me a journey time of 26hrs out and 24hrs back which was pretty good. Seats are wide and I was very grateful as I was stuck next to person of size on the first leg to HKG. Why do they let people this size into an economy seat I don't know. I stood for 3 hours of the 12 hour leg. All other sectors were fine and very comfortable for an economy product. Tasty food was served, a little odd with the timings I thought. Crew were hard working. There was an issue with the first 777's water supply and we were told not to use the water in the loos, but the hand wipes provided. Good quality screens, albeit a little slow to react to screen presses. Decent 6"" recline on seat and I felt very comfortable. Would like to see this level of comfort on an A380 and it would be an excellent economy trip. As it was I would recommend flying them and I've booked again the same trip in a few months.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-20;Singapore to New York JFK via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Seat was very spacious with very good legroom. The entertainment system had a great selection of movies and TV shows. The first leg was operated by a crew that was a little bit disinterested and didn't seem to want to be there. The second leg with  a crew that was warm and welcoming. They were very helpful when needed and had a smile on their faces. The food on the first leg was decent but nothing exceptional. The second leg had food that was much better.;POSITIVE

From Surabaya to Hongkong, was a new A330 with the reclining seat, it was very comfortable for economy class. But from Hong Kong to Osaka, we use the old Boeing 777 with a shell-back seat. The seat can't be reclined, it was very uncomfortable. But, for the other service, it's perfect! The food was good and the in-flight entertainment was good. The cabin was very clean and a comfortable temperature. I will fly with Cathay Pacific Airways again if the price was competitive (especially if there are promos).";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-18;Bangkok to Singapore in Cathay Pacific new economy class configuration. Flight was about 30% full as it was the low travel season. Seat was more comfortable than their old economy class configuration as it was able to recline and the bottom seat was pushed forward. Hence it provided a better lumbar support than the shell seats. USB and electrical connectivity was available in each seat. Charging was not allowed during take off and landing. Low fat meal and Thai style meal were tasty. Bought the ticket at S$200 during a promotion and would travel with Cathay Pacific again if there's similar promotion.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-16;"Business class flight and the first time to Melbourne via Hong Kong from Heathrow with Cathay Pacific Airways. The experience was good in terms of seat and space. It's slightly smaller from Hong Kong to Melbourne. The food was disappointing for such a long journey but better going out than on the return leg. The bar snacks were poor and the noodles finished early into the journey. Unfortunately there was an electrical fault during our journey which meant coffee was unavailable. Strangely at breakfast they managed to produce hot drinks. No newspapers or magazines offered on this flight but available in the airport lounge if travelling business class. Vanity bag not impressive. TV screen annoying as too many adverts when looking at the map. Aside from these niggles, the most important aspect was the comfort of the seat and this was excellent, even for my 6ft 5in son. Staff were excellent and especially the organisation of a wheelchair from beginning to the end of our journey for my husband, taking the stress of an unexpected illness away from us.";POSITIVE

Experience was very good from the booking staff in Auckland where we had to make some changes and inquiries regarding Baggage allowance and seating.  The onboard comfort was good for standard seating and inflight entertainment. Cabin staff were great. Meals were fine except the quantity has diminished over the years. The only offering between times was peanuts and water. We got the return trip for a very good price so I have no grumbles at all. We will fly Cathay again if the fare is again competitive.";POSITIVE

Second leg from Hong Kong to Bahrain with a stop in Dubai was better, new plane, nice business class seat with flat bed which was quite narrow compared to other airlines but comfortable. Crew were a bit more pleasant on this trip with efficiency being the name of the game. All flights with Cathay Pacific arrived on time which is great.

A bit disappointed with Cathay Pacific Airways and it was our first time flying with this airline. The check-in at Auckland was very smooth and friendly. The aircraft was a bit aged interior wise. The inflight entertainment system didn't work well, spontaneous reboots on several screens during flight and the sound didn't work at all in one of the seats. The offered food service did not meet the expectations, and they ran out of chicken meals long before they reached our seat and the only choice left was the fish. Generally you expect a toothbrush kit for a night fight over 11 hours and that the flight attendants walk by offering water and juice at a regular basis, but neither happened in this case.";NEGATIVE

The journey was pretty much flawless, planes were clean and new, staff was very professional, food was quite good, seat was very comfortable and spacious enough, and there was a good selection of movies to watch during the flight.

All the staff that I encountered on all flights were polite, friendly and very helpful. My seats were just right (I need to walk during long haul flights), the food was lovely, the best food I have had on an airline. At first I was disappointed that the film selection was not good, I do not sleep well so need to have interesting entertainment, but on browsing through the choices I found plenty of interesting documentaries and TV programmes. it is a shame there was no news channel.

cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-08;"Hong Kong to Vancouver. When you show up at the airport with one bag that is obviously too heavy, one should have a plan of action. My plan was that I was going to use my Asia Miles to pay for the extra weight. Luckily, I was served by the Check-in Counter Team Leader and he said I could either use 24,000 Miles for the excess weight (it was very heavy) or use 20,000 Miles to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business Class (and not have to pay for excess weight.) I didn't think seats were available, he said there was 1 left and it was mine. So, with only 5 minutes of waiting, I was given my Business class seat, my lounge invitation and I was on my way! Went to the Bridge Lounge (essentially two lounges in 1) then to Gate 2 for departure. The plane departed on-time and it was a very full flight. The champagne along with great meal services made the flight home fly by (pun intended). Even with the large amount of Business Class passengers, the Chief Purser made her way and introduced herself to each and everyone of us. I didn't think she would remember our names, but during the flight, whenever she saw me, she referred to me by name and asked how my flight was going. With the re-branding, CX also released a new animated Safety Briefing, along with new Safety Cards. My only complaint is the lack of the air conditioning controls for the seats, and the lack of air flow to the Business Class seats when you are sleeping. With your head in-between two walls, no air can come in or out. It was like sleeping in a small sauna.";POSITIVE

He tried several times to see if it was possible, but everything was booked up. Proceeded to the Cathay Pacific Lounge at YVR. Not the best, however a nice quiet spot to sit and relax before the 14 hour flight. Flight was delayed due to a late arrival of the inbound aircraft. Unfortunately, the gate agents (who were also the ticket agents) didn't update the YVR passengers on when we would be able to board. The cabin crew for this part of the flight were also waiting with us and they didn't have any ideas on when we would be able to depart. Eventually, approximately an hour later, we all boarded and took off for HKG. Service on board was amazing. The initial drink service into the dinner service was quick and efficient. However, the snacks weren't ""served"" in Premium Economy, as most of us were asleep in the cabin. I got up and walked around the cabin and got the snacks myself. Breakfast was served during the last two hours of the flight. Both meals I had the Chinese option, quite tasty!";POSITIVE

HKG to YVR push back on-time, waited half an hour to take off due to very heavy traffic at HKG. Crew walked around probably every 30-45 minutes to serve beverages and cup noodles were available throughout. Landed in Vancouver a couple of minutes ahead of schedule.

The pasta meal on this flight was a disaster. The seat was a shell seat and it was impossible to recline backwards. Instead, you slide forward. The return trip was on the oldest Boeing 777-200, but the flight was better as the seat was a new reclining seat. The same entertainment system despite the age of the aircraft. Cabin crew were indifferent but provided fairly good service. The meal (pork noodles) on this flight was delicious - a huge difference with the first flight. This flight was punctual despite air traffic controls. Fairly good experience with CX.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-03;"Check in at Manchester fast, efficient and friendly with Cathay Pacific Airways. Departure from Manchester to Hong Kong about one hour late due to electrical fault, crew kept everyone informed. Completely full flight. Food ok though nothing special. IFE a bit limited compared to Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Both main course choices ran out by the time crew reached our seats, only a vegetarian pasta left, however the attendant went out of his way to find a spare non-vegetarian main course from the galley at the back of the plane. Crew were efficient, call buttons answered promptly however the meal services were very rushed considering the length of the flight with crew running up the aisles and trays almost snatched away as people were still finishing their meals. Unable to make up time so arrived Hong Kong about an hour late, however there appeared to be plenty of staff at the arrival gate to assist passengers with tight onward connections. Fares a bit more expensive than options via the Middle East carriers, however the time saved by flying nonstop was well worth the extra money.";POSITIVE

I found them to be most courteous, helpful and friendly. My flights to and from France were on time. The choice of meals was good, the toilets were clean and no hassles. The cost of the ticket was competitive but it was the staff who impressed me the most and I will fly again with Cathay Pacific.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2016-01-01;San Francisco to Hong Kong and my fourth time using Cathay Pacific business class. Check in was fast and efficient. The lounge at San Francisco was relatively new and modern although it could have been a bit bigger. Boarding was on time and orderly. The seats seemed new and were very private. In my opinion these are the best business class seats in the world. They reclined flat and were extremely comfortable. Departure was on time and the meal service was done in 75 minutes. The meal was tasty and filling. The flight attendants were all professional and kind. We got to Hong Kong on time and needless to say I had a very good flight. Would definitely try it again.;POSITIVE

No problems on outbound trip, but on return in Bali, got to gate and found flight to Hong Kong cancelled till next day due to bad weather. I would have been at least 36 hours late and would have missed days work. Gate staff were only interested in handing out hotel vouchers and not interested in making alternative flight on other carriers leaving that evening. Was told that no seats available. I pointed out that there were spaces on Emirates flight the same evening. Blank expression. Getting nowhere so booked on Emirates and paid 500GBP per ticket. Complained when I got back. Complaint ignored then told I'd be getting return leg refunded. Today received £60 tax refund. Atrocious. Will never use again. Unsure of why they are rated so highly as the outbound service was average at best";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-30;"Bangkok to Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific Airways. Flight departed on-time and arrived early. Crew were very friendly and professional with meal and overall service. Ground handling at HKG was very professional, bags came early and airport staff were very nice. Return flight was last minute aircraft change - supposed to be Boeing 777-200, I was surprised to see a 747 parked at the gate and the seats we pre-booked were a bit messed up due to the aircraft change. Crew seem a bit panicked during meal service, possibly due to the aircraft change. Meals were decent comparatively to long haul. If you ever fly Cathay Pacific, either short haul or long haul, try to avoid any pasta meal choice. They're not awful, but you'd be better off with the other meal option (usually rice with a meat). Overall service was excellent and reliable.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-30;"Third time flying Vancouver to Bangkok via Hong Kong, and I'm impressed. CX889 was initially delayed by 15 minutes due to delays from New York City (JFK). Departed YVR 45 minutes late, the flight managed to keep its delay and arrived Hong Kong 45 minutes later than scheduled. Connection to to Bangkok was smooth, bags arrived safe and early. Cabin crew service was very professional and caring. Food topped standards as always. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-29;"Los Angeles to Sydney via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Overall very good with a few speed bumps. Phone reservations system slow and fair entertainment. LAX very nice lounge with wide variety food, services and staff. Boeing 777 lie flat seat was great. Food very good and too much. Instead of inflight bar/snack area, they bring a choice to you. Service friendly onboard. Hong Kong Wing Lounge open air and impersonal, a fair food selection, but poor service and no one to help. Flight to SYD (next day and was able to check bags through) just as good as previous. Return from Auckland to Los Angeles via Hong Kong on an A340. Did the best they could for business class on an A340. Seating 1-1-1 across, seats very claustrophobic, food quality and quantity fair. Would fly them again.";POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-21;Bahrain to Cebu via Hong Kong. Chose this airline to avoid Manila. The new business class seats on the A330 (CX746) were very good but awful on the Boeing 747 (CX921)on my HK-CEB route. Cabin crew were efficient but not caring or trained to strike up conversation with a passenger. Food average for a 5 star airline. Good inflight entertainment though with nice range of films. The 747 was an old aircraft with poorly designed business class seating facing at an angle toward the aisle so had to risk cringing your neck to view out of the window. Both flights were delayed by nearly more than an hour on the ground. Time was made up once in the air but it could be a little stressful if you have a tight connection. As has been mentioned previously lack of drinks was noticeable as they did not seen keen to top up a wine glass or get an extra drink for you. This route is not worthy of 5 Stars but more on 3 stars when comparing with Qatar Airways or Singapore airlines.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-21;"Manila to London via Hong Kong. Terrible experience. Flown this route with Cathay 3 times this year and the last two (Nov/Dec) have been the worst experiences. Checked in and was told there was a 50 min delay, but I will make the connection, stepped off at HK to see a sign with my connecting flight and then I was handed a new boardimg pass for a flight 10 hours later!  I was given a coupon to a hotel to stay for the waiting time but not my baggage so I could not get changed. I paid extra to get back to the UK the night before the working week, I have now had to arrive on a Monday morning  and straight to my work. I cannot recomend this airline.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-21;Taipei to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Warm greeting from the ground staff and cabin crew. Flight was departed behind a bit the schedule but was able to catch up the time. Food and beverage were significantly not enough so the size can be 30%-50% more. More hot food and better variety of drink are recommended. Cabin crew efficient and friendly during the very short one hour flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-19;"We flew Cathay Pacific from London and their online check in did not work. Had to arrive at the airport 3 hours in advance. Flight from London to Hong Kong was OK. While returning, the flight from Hanoi to Hong Kong was delayed byabout 2 hours and we had a connecting flight from Hong Kong to London. This is where it became a nightmare. The flight staff made no effort to disembark passengers on a connecting flight first. The bus arrives late to take us to the terminal and full and we have to wait for the 2nd bus. I'm amazed we made it to our connecting flight. This airline is very frugal on alcohol service. After such a nightmare trying to get to our connecting flight, would have made the flight easier with more generous helpings of alcohol.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-15;"London Heathrow to Melbourne via Hong Kong. First time on Cathay Pacific. The lounge at Heathrow is very clean and fairly quiet, we arrived for the morning flight so not too many in there. Called on time, we proceeded to board. We were in the first section of Business 1x2x1 and only 8 seats, but we felt very confined I think the problem is that Cathay Pacific cater for the Asian market and the seats are not made for anyone larger. The crew were welcoming and did their job albeit in robotic style, the food was very tasty and the wines of good quality. The cabin was very knocked about scuff marks throughout and the toilets not that clean. The flight from Hong Kong to Melbourne was much worse an old A330 (it's about time Cathay Pacific bought new planes) this one was very knocked around, my seat did not recline they did what they could but it was not very comfortable. Again the food and the crew were good. We are a Qantas FF and did get this flight back to Australia by using points (we flew over Qantas) and thought we'd try Cathay Pacific but I would be disappointed if we had paid a Business Class fare. Would we fly Cathay Pacific again probably not.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-11;"As a oneworld FF, I booked Pacific Airways as they offered a good price to Auckland for Christmas and I could use their lounges. Lounge in London shut until July 2016 so sent to ""No 1 Traveller"" which was heaving at 6pm, so went to BA T3 which is less congested. Flight took off an hour late as crew were late as stuck in traffic into airport, but no mention of this delay until at gate. Booked seat 39A (bulkhead) but promptly asked to move to accommodate a family. The dinner service commenced some 90 mins after take-off, and was a simple veg pasta + small salad + bread roll. A deeply frozen ice cream appeared separately after the dinner. No pepper, salt, eye shades, ear plugs or anything available that others do provide. IFE is excellent - great movie selection, very easy to use and fast to navigate between in-flight map and movie. Arrived in HK and used ""The Bridge"" which is very worthwhile and a great place to be for a connection - great food, nice bar, very friendly team. Flight to Auckland then also delayed, reasons unknown, and after an eerily silent slow climb (no announcements, and a few bumps), the same light dinner with ice cream appeared some 90+ minutes after take-off. Mid-flight snack bar of tasty apples and nuts/chocolate available. Crew very friendly. I have a return flight with Cathay but won't bother to book another in the future, and stick to airlines which believe in catering provisions and punctuality.";POSITIVE

I had arranged the window and my son the aisle to sit together in the A330 configuration. After the aircraft change ""the computer"" allocated us an aisle seat and a window seat in separate rows and despite checking in over 3 hours before departure we could not be accommodated together. As for Cathay Pacific - the hardware is great with new clean aircraft and respectable personal space for economy class. Service robotic with a take it or leave it attitude. ";POSITIVE

I have flown to Asia since 1996 and Cathay Pacific Airways is the most polite I have ever experienced, from check-in to the flight attendants. The seats were good.

Meals were good and varied.";POSITIVE

Cathay Pacific provided 3 nights hotel accommodation with 3 meals a day, and new flights complete with airport transfer. The representative was extremely helpful and informative at all times.

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-12-03;"Hong Kong to San Francisco with Cathay Pacific. Booked on premium economy but upgraded to business class at boarding, pleasant surprise and no complaint. Seat 19D. Priority boarding and welcome from friendly crew with pre-departure drink and hot towel served. Menu and amenity kit provided. Pillow and duvet on the foot rest. Nice cabin layout in 1x2x1. Cabin nearly full.  Flight deck announcement was clear and informative. Some turbulence during the flight and arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule.  Made the trip from Hong Kong to San Francisco in about 11 hours and 28 minutes. Once airborne, supper service with drinks. Cheese plate available on request. Service was concluded in about two hours so plenty of time to rest and sleep. Since I was upgraded, my main meal was from economy in disposable tray placed on a ceramic plate. The salad was awful with no dressing and fruit salad as dessert, both in plastic economy containers but transferred to a tray with cloth napkin and metal cutlery. Vegetarian option, either western or Asian, are always awful and disgusting on Cathay Pacific. Asian options are usually overcooked vegetable in oily sauce served with steamed rice. Western options are typically some sort of pasta swimming in tomato based sauce. Anyway did not eat much of the food other than the fruit salad. Cabin crew friendly and available through the flight. Since I was upgraded from premium economy I was mostly ignored and not served additional food items such as dessert tray or cheese plate. Slept for a few hours. Woke up hungry and had to ask for some fresh fruit but was told that they did not have fresh fruit onboard but she will check in the economy cabin. She came back with left over cheese plate and fruit bowl from left over supper service. Watched a few movies and it was time for pre-arrival breakfast. This is strange as we were arriving into San Francisco International Airport at 9PM why they were serving breakfast at that hour? Would prefer to have light snacks such as a sandwich or a bowl of soup.  The pre-arrival snack again was transferred to the meal tray from economy cabin. Some kind of corn and something else and salad minus dressing plus fresh cut fruit for desert. Noticed one thing in both premium economy and business class is that Cathay Pacific has eliminated salt and pepper in both cabins. In premium economy cabin you used to get salt and pepper sachets and stone shakers in business cabin but not for the last 3 trips. Immigration is a breeze at that hour and custom was quick. Bags took a while to come out, more than typical. Overall an OK flight in business. Comfortable seat in business cabin for skinny people, large people will find the seat to be very narrow especially at the foot well when the seat goes horizontal. Cabin service is average, cabin crew friendly but you need to ask if you need anything.";POSITIVE

Manchester to HKG was about 80% full but was lucky to get a row of 3 seats to myself, seats were very comfortable. The crew are efficient and professional and although the food portions serves were small they were tasty enough and you can order a cup of instant noodles. They lay out a small snack bar so you can help yourself to fruit, crisps, peanuts and soft drinks. The plane seemed quite new and was clean with a USB charging point at every seat. From HKG to KUL and back on a regional A330 which was comfortable enough for a sub 4hr flight. HKG to MAN was 100% full in all classes and I was lucky to be in an aisle seat and was comfortable for what was a 14hr flight.";POSITIVE

I didn't have to pay anything extra, and I had a hassle-free check-in at the airport.

Beautiful quiet and comfortable seat and cabin. Highly recommend the small cabin on the 777 (rows 11/12). I would put a bet this is the best Business Class offering on any intra North American flight.";POSITIVE

Both aircraft acceptable but only had small screens, film selection not good, no hot towels and only allowed one alcoholic pre dinner drink. Asked for a gin and tonic and a beer 330ml and was told I could only have one or the other. Food was okay but not up to Emirates of SIA. Cabin staff were courteous and responsive. Both flights were on time. Had to walk what seemed like miles in Hong Kong terminal to get from one flight to another, up and down about 5 or 6 escalators.

The leg rest for front row seats are useless because they are too short and bite into your calve. Foot rests for other seats are better. Seat width is fine but would much prefer full premium economy cabin. Check in agent was lovely and professional. Given priority access through immigration at Melbourne Airport but not needed as lines are fairly short. Anyway got through Australian immigration in less than 10 minutes. Once airside, used the Cathay Pacific lounge at Melbourne Airport. Lounge is tiny will a lot of passengers with limited seating. Food is boring, usual dim sum and noodle, etc. Looking very tired and unappetizing. A few alcohol at self service counter. There is an Nepresso machine. Boarding was organized with priority boarding for premium class passengers and Marco Polo members. Departed on time. Pre-departure drinks were offered followed by hot towel. Once airborne, lunch service began. Ordered vegetarian meal and served first. Food was disgusting and did not eat much of it. Some sort of hummus as starter and a main course of overcooked vegetable and some carbohydrate - really really awful. Pre-landing snack was alright, some kind of hard bread with feta cheese or unidentified dairy product. Cabin crew was very nice and professional. Present through the flight to serve passengers. Landing into Hong Kong Airport was on time. Overall a decent flight. It would be nice to have second hot towel service either before serving pre-landing snack or after, and also a salad dressing for the dinner salad instead of just a wedge of lemon as dressing.";POSITIVE

I already have paid a non-cancelable hotel in Kathmandu for the night I won´t be able to be there due to the flights rescheduling.

PE cabin completely full. Shared bathrooms with economy cabin. IFE screens good size maybe 11 or 12 inches seem a little larger than iPad. Good contents plenty to watch to kill time. Cabin clean and tidy, bathrooms kept fully stocked and clean. Flight scheduled to depart Hong Kong at 10:20 AM but delayed to 10:35 AM and finally departed after 11am. Arrived into Melbourne after 11pm about 40 minutes late. Pre departure drinks offered but no champagne only water and juices. Hot towel offered only once be nice to have another hot towel service prior to arrival. Once airborne lunch service began. Pre ordered vegetarian meal and served first but after finished with meal stuck with tray for the next hour as cabin crew was serving the rest of the economy cabin before returning to clear trays. Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal. Recommend CX provides salad dressing and a second hot towel service.";POSITIVE

Flight attendants were always on point with everything. The inflight entertainment was great. Slept fine, although that was due to the fact I had the whole row. Pillows, blankets, warm towels at least 2 times on the flight. Free cup noodles whenever you got hungry. I don't remember what I had for breakfast, but I remember not having any complaints.

Food is served in timely manner and they come by to check if plates can be cleared, to avoid being stuck with a table for extended period of time. Our company policy does not allow flying business class to Hong Kong so you either top-up yourself or hope on upgrade. I noticed quite often my internal clients are upgraded, resulting in a lot of positive feedback. Quite a lot of timeslots available. So plenty of choice to arrive at your desired time. Good corporate rates, very competitive compared to its main rival for Singapore flights. Main lounge is good, and in some cases, the business class gate waiting area is separate from economy.  On this route, different timings use different aircraft, so you won’t know if you’ll get a new pod based business class seat or a regional business class seat, unless you’ve taken the relevant time slot before.";POSITIVE

Food not great on either flight, snack box breakfast before arrival in Perth a selection of very sugary snacks, no hot option although not surprising on a 7 hr 30 min flight. Both flights delayed, first due to late arrival of flight from Hong Kong with no obvious reason. Second due to longer route due to volcano on Java which is not the fault of the airline.

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-11-05;"Hong Kong to Zurich with Cathay Pacific. Despite a 9 hour delay out of Hong Kong this was almost the perfect flight experience. I suspect the fog at many key European airports over this time was the background cause of the delays but it was difficult to find out if this was a major reason. I wish Cathay and other airlines would follow British Airways example and allow the Captain to provide a nice full comprehensive weather and flight briefing as these aspects can help forward planning a lot when travelling on business. Nevertheless, I was put up in a nice airport hotel in Hong Kong and then had impeccable service from the wonderful cabin crew en-route to Zurich. Only one aspect spoilt this flight experience and that was the final meal - it was possibly the worst airline meal I have ever had. I found out that even with a major delay of 9 hours or more, the same food is kept for that particular flight making it some 21 hours before it is finally consumed - and it tasted like it too! Unfortunately I had this meal after I had filled in the Customer Satisfaction Survey so it would not be recorded in there - otherwise a good flight but I will never forget that supper meal on Cathay Pacific.";POSITIVE

Unfortunately due to a problem with my reservation which I made through BA check in took a long time but was eventually sorted out by the very Cathay Pacific agent at HK central. Due to the delay I had to proceed straight to the gate once I reached HKIA. Boarding was done quickly the aircraft a Boeing 777-300er was spotless, was shown to my seat 1A with drinks and amenities provided. The seat is fantastic with lots of floor and storage space. Meal options/orders taken prior to departure departed on time and once airborne service started quickly. The food and service provided was first class, the crew very experienced chatty and available. I managed to sleep for 4 or 5 hours during the flight using the flat bed seat and a very comfortable duvet. When I was awake I used the Inflight entertainment system which was clear and offered lots of variety. Crew provided snacks and drinks throughout the 12h 20min flight, dinner was offered about 2 hrs out of London and again service and food was extremely good. Flight arrived around 15 min late due to airport delays but once off, bags were waiting and I was out of T3 within 20 mins. The service provided by Cathay Pacific Airways have really opened my eyes to the the service experienced by the airlines I normally use. Time to look at the great alternatives out there including Cathay Pacific after this great flight.";POSITIVE

Cons: No eye mask/care pack supplied, just a thin blanket. Small luggage allowance (20kg). Entertainment options are limited. It was an expensive flight because I wanted to have a short stopover in HK so for me it was worth it, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend this airline unless it's the cheapest option.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-30;"London to Auckland via Hong Kong. Excellent service from the cabin crew on all sectors of our journey.  I was particularly impressed that during the night flight, the nearby galley was in semi-darkness to avoid disturbing passengers' sleep, and the 2 stewardesses in the galley were talking quietly. We used 3 lounges at HKG: the WIng, the Bridge and Arrivals. All had showers, and plenty of choice, though both the Wing and the Bridge got very busy around 23.30 as there are a number of departing flights at that time. The Boeing 777-300 in particular is very comfortable with lots of storage space. The A340 was the only aircraft where the seat was less comfortable (the so-called coffin seat). I'd ordered a veggie meal: this was delivered on all flights but instead of just the main meal being vegetarian, the whole tray was a dedicated veggie tray. what this means is that I had no choice at all of entree or dessert, though there were vegetarian alternatives available. The crew did their best to accommodate my preference but in future I don't think I'll bother to order a veggie meal as it is easy enough (in business class) to choose suitable options from the main menu. I'd definitely prefer to fly long haul with CX again.";POSITIVE

Very uncomfortable as others have mentioned and not before time for Cathay to upgrade these or take these antiquated A340 aircraft out of service. Inflight entertainment system slow and unresponsive despite very empty flight, with small screen. Cathay have fantastic IFE on their other aircraft I know.

Airplane was very old, the food tray did not come out so staff apologised and gave us a cushion to put the food tray on. My seat would not go back as promised. It looks like Cathay Pacific need to spend more money to keep the level of maintenance higher. The food was great but the staff were not doing their job properly, I asked for a glass of water, I asked again and the water came 30 minutes after the meals were served. ";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-23;"Connected from a domestic American Airlines flight to Cathay Pacific flight from Chicago to Hong Kong.  CX use the BA Terraces First Class Lounge at ORD which is adequate but fairly small, and feels more like a business class lounge. Was accompanied from the lounge to the gate, and welcomed and shown my seat. Cabin staff was top-notch, and better than on previous CX flights out of JFK and LAX. Pajamas, slippers and a nice Aesop wash bag were given out. Meals show signs of some cost-cutting over the past five years, and my veal main entree for lunch was overcooked and dry. Beverage choices including wines were very good. The refreshed First Class Suite is still outstanding, and I prefer it to the total enclosures used by some airlines. Washrooms were maintained throughout the 14-hour flight, and staff attentive and available. Cabin staff walk through the cabin periodically, but also responds very promptly to the call button. The flight deck crew kept us well-informed, without excessive communication. This flight was very smooth, with very little turbulence. Overall, an outstanding experience, though a small improvement on the catering side would make an excellent product even better.";POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-21;A very comfortable flight with Cathay Pacific Airways from London Heathrow to Hong Kong in premium economy. Lots of leg room even when the person in front reclined. The food was adequate but I do not like the trend of only ice cream for dessert and there was no cheese and crackers. On the return journey they said they had run out of meal choices and there were only 10 people in the cabin! Luckily they found the meal of choice from somewhere. I travel to Hong Kong regularly and like the many choices of flight times that Cathay offers. The flight back was not full so was even more comfortable. All flights were on time and the luggage arrived safely. I will happily use Cathay again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-15;"The food on Cathay Pacific Airways was truly atrocious - I had ordered a gluten free meal and they seem to think that offering a plate of salad leaves and a few pieces of green limp peppers is the best they can do. The normal menu was a piece of salmon which would have been completely fine - clearly they have no clue as to what contains gluten and err on the side of extreme caution. The breakfast served on arrival into Hong Kong was marginally better and actually looked more palatable then the congealed food offered on the normal menu, so much so that I decided not to cancel the gluten free meal for my return journey - big mistake! Breakfast on flight back into Manchester was what looked like a piece of steak with lump mash - disgusting! Most of the staff onboard on the way out were friendly however the purser was rude and the not the customer service you would expect whether you were travelling in economy or business class. The service on the way back was practically non existent as they clearly expect on a 0100hrs flight that no one will expect anything - only one drink offered prior to the meal service and nothing offered with the actual meal. On request of a bottle of water - it arrived 20 mins later. The seats are fine, however the inflight entertainment needs a serious upgrade in comparison to other airlines. As this is a relatively new direct service from Manchester, I expected more and would definitely not recommend this service to anyone. I dread to think what it was like in economy if business was so bad!";NEGATIVE

The first leg from Perth to Hong Kong met expectations, but disappointed on the other flights due to repeated equipment / power failure. The malfunctioning in-flight entertainment on all three legs made the experience rather challenging and frustrating.

I did not feel I got value for money and could have saved by going on a budget airline.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-09;"I recently flew Cathay Pacific from Melbourne to Zurich via Hong Kong (return) in business class. The Cathay attendants and ground staff were excellent on both legs of my trip. The seats really are first rate and Cathay Pacific business is the equal of first on some airlines. The food and drink was also good. The only criticism would be that the lounge in Melbourne really is a bit small and the range of food and drink available are underwhelming. ZRH lounge is a bit better, but not great. If you are flying on to other destinations it's a bit of a drag to have to route your trip through ZRH and connections on the return trip may require a night spent at ZRH depending on the departure time. Cathay Pacific could turnover their IFE films a bit quicker, but no problem if your trip straddles two calendar months.";POSITIVE

At 2:15am they informed that flight will depart at 4am, and then at 2:30am they informed that flight will depart at 6:00am. Still waiting for flight - God knows when it will depart. If they could tell us in the night itself that they will depart in morning, we can have stay in some hotel in night. But Cathay Pacific arrangements are very bad. Airline staff at airport was very rude and was not ready to reply any of the query. Really bad arrangements. ";NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-10-04;"This was my first long distance flight with Cathay Pacific, from Zurich to Manila via Hong Kong, and I was pleasantly surprised. The seat, the seat space, the food and the cabin crew were above average. The most important thing for me was the handling of the flight delay. There was a one hour delay in Zurich and it was obvious there is no chance on a 11 hour flight to land in Hong Kong in time. I had a connecting flight to Manila. The time between flights was only 50 minutes, which is a bit crazy. To my surprise, the ground crew of Cathay was prepared to name about 35 passengers with that connecting flight to Manila, gathered us in the front of the airplane so we could get off the plane right after it stopped at the gate. On the ground they guided us quickly thru the airport to the connecting flight, which was waiting for us. We landed in Manila over one hour later as scheduled, but at least for me that was okay. I definitely will use Cathay again.";POSITIVE

The service from the cabin staff was also good, the food was OK, and the ground service did allow us on before the economy passengers. But you do have to share the toilets with the economy passengers, which is a problem at busy times, and does put me off a little. I think Cathay Pacific needs to also consider Lufthansa's idea of getting paid entry to the business lounge. I think I would just pay the extra and fly Business next time.";POSITIVE

A little over an hour flight, so quick meal provided, one choice, with Tea box. Newspapers available on the jetway each time, which I took advantage of as the TV options are limited - the non English does not have English subtitling. A330-300 seats have plenty of space and worth the little bit extra taking Cathay Pacific Airways.";POSITIVE

Arrived at JFK on AA for this flight with a boarding pass from an AA kiosk, but wanted a CX ticket, so I visited the counter in terminal 7 and the person that helped me was helpful, printing the pass and answering questions about the flight. Terminal 7 is a bit limited, gate area small, and gate staff appeared mostly non-CX. The boarding was efficient. Staff were welcoming and attentive on board. I had an exit row on the left side. There was a fair amount of activity in the galley throughout the flight, and the duty free appeared to be in front of us, so not a good choice if you sleep lightly. The food was a bit lower than other Asia carriers (ANA etc), but above US carriers. Entertainment system was good (exit rows have to store armrest screens early), but the selection of non-English content lacked English subtitling. Not an overly busy flight, which helped the experience. Depending on price gap above US carriers, it is worth spending a bit extra.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-09-22;"This was my first flight to Europe in Premium Economy. I have flown Premium Economy to Asia with Qantas and BA but 8 hours is a lot different to 24 hrs.  The width of the Cathay Pacific premium economy seat and armrest are big enough that you do not touch the person next to you and do not feel restricted when eating. I had a bulkhead to HKG and it is the best option but the leg rest is a little short - putting my cabin bag on the floor overcame that issue. To Paris I was one row back, so only had the foot rest but it was still okay. When the seat in front is on full recline there is still plenty of room. 8 inches of recline doesn't sound much but combined with the seat width it is surprisingly good enough to get some good sleep. There is separate boarding for PE and this works well and they make it very clear that you are not in Economy. A glass of champagne before take-off is always nice. I read reports that cabin staff can be absent during the flight. and to a degree that's right, but they are very friendly and efficient. If you request something via the call button they are quick to respond so I was happy. IFE is as good as anyone else. Its not Business Class, but that does not mean its uncomfortable or basic. The Premium Economy cabin is curtained off from economy so you do feel a little privileged but get brought down to earth each time you have to share the Economy toilets. I got off the flight feeling fresh, which to me, was a compliment to the product. I think the Qantas seat and environment on the A380 (not the 747) is slightly better but its only marginal. Cathay Pacific nudges ahead of BA by a similar small margin. You wouldn't be unhappy with PE on any of the carriers but what I think what makes Cathay Pacific Premium Economy of choice is that, apart from a quality product, they have priced it ""on the money"" and this puts them ahead of Qantas. If you've got an appropriate tier status with Oneworld you get to use Business or First Class Lounges en route and the CX ones are very good (particularly The Wing in HKG) which adds to the overall comfort of the flight.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-09-19;"Cathay Pacific Airways are my preferred airline and I have flown them many times. I travelled Doha to Hong Kong business class on their A330. From the moment you enter the aircraft you are looked after excellently. I am a Oneworld Emerald and it is a nice touch when the purser or CSD gives you an extra welcome and chat prior to departure, thanking me for flying with Cathay. They look after the regular travellers and go out of their way to make sure you are well looked after, served food and drinks first, giving you more time to rest. The seat is very comfortable and spacious with lots of storage space and space next to the window. Seat reclines to the full flat position. What I like about the seat is that the screen folds away and also the tray table. I am very tall and  can stretch out fully in these seats. The food is of a high quality and tasty, and a good range of beverages including the Champagne. Entertainment is varied and extensive. ";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-09-16;"We bought our Cathay Pacific Airways tickets 8 months ago to travel in November from Toronto to Hong Kong on a direct flight. I used Expedia to get my full fare ticket whereas my husband used his Asia miles to redeem his. Then last week I got a call from Expedia telling me that our Nov 11 afternoon flight got cancelled by Cathay. We were bumped to the next flight out on Nov 12. Since my husband used mileage redemption, there is no flexibility to move to earlier departure dates. I used 4 hours to call Marco Polo Club (airlines membership), Asia Miles and Expedia to sort things out. How could a major airline cancel a flight 2 months before departure? Big impact on passengers who make same day connections to other Asian cities via Hong Kong. In our case, I prepaid a non-refundable hotel room. Since I am arriving Hong Kong a day late, I have to lose out my money for 1 night. My precious vacation is further squeezed to 1 day less. Very upset. I will not use Cathay Pacific again. ";NEGATIVE

Cabin crew were friendly and attentive, working hard even during the quiet hours. Flight progress was well informed by the flight deck. The inflight entertainment system was fairly new on the Boeing 777-300ER with an excellent interface but TV show choices were rather limited in my opinion.

I was on a 16 hour flight from NY to HK and was having my first meal after 13 hours of flying (I slept through the main meal).

The CX gate staff took a fair amount of grief from a few vociferous individuals during this time and whilst they could be criticised for not providing information in a timely manner and on occasion promising an update within 10 mins and not delivering that for 30 mins or so, CX should be complimented for how quickly they ended up getting us away. First off, no one should question an airline that delays departure because of a technical issue. Assuming it took an hour or so to determine that the fault could not be fixed, and a replacement aircraft required, it then took CX less than 4 hours to find that aircraft, ensure it was in operational condition, fuel it up, unload the previous aircraft, load up the new aircraft and no doubt complete copious amounts of paperwork. On top of this, a replacement pilot was required due to the restrictions on working hours.

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-18;"Compared to the other NA carriers which fly this route CX is by far the best. Food, wine and the entertainment ranks near the top. Lots of FA's so there is no shortage of service. Noticed the NA crews do not smile (I know its artificial but still) like the HK based crews.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-16;"A very long flight, and so I chose a window seat so that I could look at the Himalayas, Hindu Kush ect. But not allowed to because the blinds were to be pulled down for all the legs of the journey, both in and out of Hong Kong. Apparently this is Cathay Pacific policy, and is to encourage passengers to sleep (thereby keeping them quiet). I can sleep well on a plane, but not for 24 hours! Most airlines have eye shades.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-13;"Outbound flight from LHR to HKG was late taking off by half an hour, so my bags didn't make the connecting flight to Guangzhou as the connection was only an hour in the first place. I found the seat and leg room quite small compared to Emirates economy, also the service was not up to the same standard. My bags were delivered by courier a day later. The same trouble on the return leg as the one Guangzhou flight to hong kong was delayed, and I had to tear through to board for the hong kong-london leg. My bags just made it. Noisy, rattling aircraft and again seat felt cramped. Largely disappointed as Cathay Pacific had won airline of the year, but they didn't come close to Emirates.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-13;"Apart from a delayed take-off the flight Paris-Hong Kong (B777) was un-eventful. Seats were a bit hard but good legroom. Good entertainment system. Pre-dinner drink service well received. Meals rather bland and tasteless. No cabin service to speak of. Hong Kong-Adelaide flight (A330) late take off due to disorganised boarding procedure and extra security checks inside the airbridge, which seem pretty brief, pointless and frustrating to me. Seat comfort better than B777 but seemed like less legroom. Entertainment system had no sound, FA went to check but never returned. Another FA was blunt to the point of rudeness when I tried to use toilet 40 minutes after take off because seat belt sign was still on - yet 6 other passengers had already done so and several others were on their feet. No pre-dinner drinks service. During meal service FA spilled a glass of wine into my lap. Noisy sleepless flight. Not happy. My rating below is based on this flight. In respect of all four of our Cathay Pacific flights to Paris return I was disappointed with the on-line check in and seat selection process. Not once did we get the seats we pre-booked nor did the on-line check in work properly. I chose Cathay Pacific because of their previous top rating. It was a mistake.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-12;"I'm sure this is in the terms and conditions, but it had never happened to me before. Upon check-in at Singapore I was asked to present my credit card. I said I didn't have it with me as I didn't realise I needed to present it. So the lady at check-in said I couldn't board my flight today. I said I've paid online, have a ticket, asked why I can't fly, told them I'm not going anywhere until I get on that flight or am at least not told why, so I was asked to hand over all my details and step to the side while the rest of the flight was checked in. About 45 minutes later the check-in lady asked for my credit card company contact phone number, I said I did not know and she could easily find it on an internet search, which I would've done if I was able. 15 to 20 minutes later I was told I was allowed to check in, after almost everyone in line had left. Eventually check-in told me I needed to present the physical credit card I booked with to prevent credit card fraud, even though on the e-ticket the credit card name matched my name on the booking and on my passport, so I don't see how this would constitute fraud if all my details matched. At no time was there ever any sympathy or apology. Funnily enough, on the return leg there was no hassle at Colombo airport check-in.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-08;"The cabin staff were amazing - very helpful, cheerful, patient and polite. On a separate review I have noted the lack of seat comfort and especially the fact that the seats did not recline on the A340-300 Hong Kong to New Zealand legs of the journey. This is the main reason that I would not recommend this airline.";NEGATIVE

This is my first time flying First Class apart from upper class with Virgin Atlantic Airways. First Class lounge at Heathrow Airport is a sheer delight, peaceful, very few passengers and excellent breakfast. It was such a lovely experience - champagne, food and full attention to me. The flight attendant knew when I wanted snacks or drink. The only sad part was my turnaround at HK was too short as I had only an hour between arrival and departure at HK to experience the lounges fully at HK.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-04;Cathay Premium Economy is about extra space and absolutely nothing else. If all you are seeking is additional space then fine but this is not true Premium Economy. The meal choices and portions are economy class as is the service or lack thereof. There was not even a menu offered that subsidiary Dragonair can offer in economy. One quick run to dump an economy class meal and drink and that was it for Premium. Not even close to premium service compared to other carriers.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-08-03;"Another excellent set of flights onboard CX (MEL-ICN-MEL VIA HKG). The level of customer service quality by cabin crew was outstanding on all four sectors. Food and beverages across the board were very good, with Haagen Dazs ice cream a nice way to conclude service. IFE was plentiful and seats generally comfortable. Pretty much on par with Singapore Airlines although they still remain my preference for travel from MEL. Overall, extremely content with all flights.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-31;"I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The plane was very clean, had good entertainment options and the food was lovely. However I felt the layout of Premium Economy wasn't the best as there is only one toilet in Premium which is located on the right hand side of the cabin. This meant every passenger on the left side who needed to use the rest room (which could be several times on a 14 hour flight) would have to cross the bulkhead seats (which is where I was sat) at the front of the cabin. If you plan to sleep do not select these seats as you will be knocked by passengers trying to cut across to use the rest room. I also felt CP have tried to fit too many seats in the bulkhead row of the middle section. I feel the end two seats impede the aisle from business class so when catering came through the curtain from business to premium there is a good chance your left leg might take a bump. Three seats in this row would probably be a better option. The seats could have been a little comfier for the money paid. The only downfall on the entertainment was that it was a little light on choice, I've traveled other airlines in premium economy and they had a healthier selection of films. Overall I would travel with Cathay Pacific again but will probably spend the extra money to fly in business class.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-26;Cathay went the extra mile yesterday when they contacted ground staff at Paris CDG to accompany me to my next flight (not Cathay) because of a very short connection time. This is not the first time they have done this: last year we had a problem with Air France in HKG but Cathay (with whom we had flown from Cairns) sorted it out. Great business class seat configuration. Everything very handy. Efficient service. Well done.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-25;"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively. I hope we were just unlucky, because these statistics don't make good reading: 75% of our flights delayed by an average of 50 minutes.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-24;"Four segments (BLR-HKG, HKG-PER, PER-HKG, HKG-BLR) each delayed over 1.5 hours, and no notification until about one hour prior to flight (except the first segment, which was notified about three hours in advance). Typical reason ""due to late arrival of aircraft"" which is euphemistic for ""just wait a while."" Cant-be Specific, or (ahem) Cathay Pacific reps, when I told them I needed to get home tonight from Hong Kong, but now there was no gate and only an estimated time two hours hence, offered instead for me to fill out a ""feedback form."" Four strikes in four pitches - I won't be flying Cathay again. ";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-24;"Was travelling two adults and two kids with seating fixed at the time of booking the tickets (and seat numbers specified on the tickets). When doing the online check in, we realized that Cathay Pacific had decided to change our seating. Of course they did not have the courtesy to inform us up about this to give us the chance to cancel the tickets and travel with another airline. So, Cathay Pacific had decided to split our family up. 1 adult is seated with 2 kids and 1 adult is seated somewhere completely different - 21 rows apart, to be precise. We found this out after normal office hours and then discovered a that Cathay Pacific only has reservations desks (as opposed to customer services desks) that you can call. Could not get their international 24 hour number to Work. Tried their Hong Kong number but after spending 15 minutes on hold I hung up. Next morning called the local reservation office in Zurich. Sorry sir, can't help with seat assignment it is a different system but you can do it yourself online (had already explained that we tried this but there were no 4 free seats together or near each other) or ask at the chek-in at the airport. As any family reading this can probably imagine, we arrived completely tired to our holiday after the long flight after plenty hassle of shuffling 2 small children back and forth in the cabin between mummy and daddy at mean times, toilet times, crying times etc. Now, we will see about the return flight after which we shall never set foot on Cathay Pacific again.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-22;"An A330 which I realise is not new to the CX fleet, but this aircraft was downright grubby. The padding on the seats was non-existant, and the fabric was worn and threadbare. These seats were unacceptable, and for an 8 hour flight, especially so. The cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. The cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. No sooner had we left the ground, than everyone was ordered - and I mean ordered - to close their window blinds, and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. So much for having a window seat. At one point, while going to the washroom, I literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction, and I never received so much as a ""thanks"" as he barged past. The meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen - thankfully it was all over quickly. The food itself was ok - passable for economy class. Overall, this was grim. I'm seriously trying to decide whether to give up on Cathay Pacific after this. It's a shame - this used to be a great airline to fly with, but now it seems they're only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins (I'm speaking from experience). They should take a few tips from their hosts at Doha. The inflight entertainment was passable, if it wasn't for the constant interruptions for announcements - usually for trying to sell bits and pieces, or announcements between the crew.";NEGATIVE

I buy a Premium Economy class ticket every time and I have been upgraded to business class twice already in a year. ";POSITIVE

Not much but satisfying (hot sandwich and some mango juice). Flight was smooth and the crew was great. Hong Kong to New York : Great food and drinks, legroom was enough. Toilet was clean. For an economy class seat was excellent. Entertainment systems were perfect (many movies, modern music, etc.)  New York to Hong : crew was more friendly, welcoming and at your service. At the airport, even though we were there 5 or 6 hours before our flight, the check-in kiosk was already open. The food was excellent. The two in-flight meals were very delicious. I requested some cup noodles for free and some juice. The toilets were clean. Onboard entertainment system was well-supplied with modern movies, shows, and music. The flight HKG to MNL was like my previous three. Food was excellent. I wasn't even expecting food because the flight was just a little under 2 hours. In-flight entertainment system was good (I was able to continue my tv show marathon of How To Get Away With Murder from the flight from New York). For a short flight, Cathay still provided excellent service.";POSITIVE

The flight to Nagoya was great with very helpful cabin crew, who helped searching for my charging cable after all passengers left the aircraft at Taipei for the second leg of the flight. An incredible range of inflight entertainment. The aircraft was less than two years old and was comfortable. Return flight was great as well on another new aircraft less than 3 years old. The cabin was comfortable and food was delicious, though not outstanding. Cabin crew were fairly helpful but cabin presence could have been more frequent. The flights were on time with very little problems.";POSITIVE

The check in agent guided me on the self check in procedures and helped me in registering for the marco polo club (Cathay's frequent flyer program). Despite a 55 minute delay, boarding commenced quickly. Warm smiles greeted you as you enter the aircraft. One of the crew guided me to my seat. The seat itself has generous legroom and is very comfortable with a nose wheel camera view in the InFlight Entertainment. Despite being served a cold sandwich and some drinks during the flight, the inflight service was excellent as the crew efficiently distributed the cold sandwiches, as well as offering a few drinks. The flight came to an end with a sunrise and a touchdown in Hong Kong.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-04;"Overall a great airline. The check-in process is my only complaint after may years of flying with them. I carry an instrument with me when I fly that is oversized. It fits in the overhead bins and does not take up more room in the end than your average suitcase but the dimensions are odd. The last time I flew the check-in staff said there was absolutely no way I could bring it on board. We argued back and forth, got managers involved, threatened to change our flights. Eventually we got approval. A previous time I flew Cathay I booked my ticket at the last minute due to a medical emergency with my wife. I had a 50 minute layover in Tokyo, but that was the best I could do. I went to the airport the night before to try and be put on standby on a flight that evening so I would certainly make my connection. I have never been treated so poorly. Nobody would listen to what was going on. Everyone just said no and walked away. Turns out the flight was not even full, they were just not willing to help. The flights are wonderful however. The planes are well-maintained and seats are comfortable. Staff are quite attentive and friendly. The food was decent for airplane food. In-flight entertainment was as good as any I have experienced. In the end I highly recommend Cathay Pacific but they need to work on their ground staff as they were rude and inattentive.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-07-04;"Hong Kong to Zurich and return from Heathrow to Hong Kong, booked in Premium Economy but very fortunate to receive an upgrade on the HKG-ZRH leg. The fish dinner in business out of Hong Kong was so fresh and simply superb, as was the service. Unfortunately we ran through a lot of clear air turbulence during the night but we need to be reminded that this is not the fault of the airline that such meteorological phenomenon occur. The return flight in PE out of Heathrow was jammed packed but the cabin crew did their best, despite annoying fellow travellers who think it fun to recline their seats during the take off roll. On this flight, I thought again that its time passengers were allowed to tip cabin crew for good service. One again wonders why this is not allowed? It may just make a huge difference to our travel experiences, on some airlines. I recommend the HKG-ZRH run on Cathay for a good convenient service into Europe.";POSITIVE

We were informed that the flight was delayed 2 hours in which originally would not allow me to connect to my connecting flight CX705 to Bangkok. Upon check in, the handling was great and they moved my Bangkok flight to CX713 which leaves 40 minutes later. We were also given a 10$ coupon for food as a result of the delay. We left Vancouver at 4.05am local time (originally should be at 2.00am) and we hit some turbulence near the Hokkaido region of Japan and again off-coast Japan to the south. We arrived at 8.15am+1 (should be 7.40am+1 after delay or 5.40am+1 originally). A ground staff was waiting for me and assisted me to my connecting CX713 flight. I was the last person on board but did make it safely through the crowd. We arrived Bangkok early just to find out that my luggage wasn't successfully transferred from the Vancouver flight and that it would arrive around 2.00pm on CX653.

The staff were indifferent: few similes, unlike on Philippine or Singapore Airlines, or Cebu Pacific, where looking passengers in the eye and smiling are the order of the day. The flight was also close to full so there was little chance of having an empty seat next to a traveller. The baggage allowance for check in is only 20 kilograms: on some other airlines, it is 23 or even 30kg. Overall not particularly impressive and a case of living on their laurels. The inflight entertainment lacked a 'hits and memories of the 60s, 70s and 80s' channel.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-28;"I had high expectations for this return flight to Melbourne based on previous reviews and for the most part Cathay didn't disappoint. I really liked the seat space and privacy. The Boeing 777 version is better than the A330 because the seat storage unit is bigger and the bed position felt wider and softer. I liked it better than BA's business class seat - especially when travelling solo. The catering was a bit hit and miss. The chilli prawns and rice out of London were excellent but a Western style chicken dish from Hong Kong was bland. In general, I think they create better Asian dishes. I've not experienced a business class meal service from a trolley before, and I'm not sure I like it. What I did find odd is that they never provided salt and pepper to season the meal. As a pre dinner drink I enjoyed trying a couple of their signature cocktails (different option on different routes). Boarding was easy, once you found the right line. The lounges in Hong Kong were good but busy. I especially liked the shower facilities and the made-to-order catering. But signage for the lounges was dire, so I struggled to find the one I was looking for at times. The lounges in London and Melbourne are also very small with no views, so I found them quite boring. Of my 4 flights, only 1 actually left on time, which was poor. The choice of inflight entertainment was a bit limited but the screen size was good (although it wasn't possible to tilt the screen for a better viewing angle). The staff were quick to respond to any requests. However, they tended to do things by rote. Once I was asked if I'd like more cashews, but that kind of spontaneity was mostly absent. But they were all very pleasant and welcoming.";POSITIVE

The airline's in-flight entertainment was new, but it was a 7 inch touchscreen, much smaller than the screen of my iPad. Singapore Airlines economy seats offer a 10 inch screen and also a handheld 3-4 inch touchscreen controller. There was also a USB port to charge hand phones or tablets. However, the seats don't include an A/C port or an additional USB port. The seat was newly designed with this adjustable head rest.

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-18;"CX's regional business class seats are quite uncomfortable. The seats slide forward and recline only midway, so it's difficult to remain in position without sliding. I felt a lot of pressure on my legs just to keep me on my seat. On this particular flight, the seats were configured 2-2-2, but I've flown this route before where the seats were configured 2-3-2 (worse). No privacy. The seats are not wide enough and are so close together that I could feel my neighbour's every move. You also have to share elbow space with your neighbour. When there are drinks on the elbow area, you have to stay upright so as not to hit two glasses on that same space. Since there is no storage, your neighbour's meal menu, magazine or iPad will also be in your space. This is awful for a 3-hour flight, unacceptable for business class, more fit for premium economy. The toilets are also cramped. This is really light years away from CX long haul business class. They use planes with business class cabins configured for long haul flights on the Hong Kong-Haneda route or the shorter Hong Kong-Manila route, surely they can do the same for the Hong Kong-Narita route.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-16;"Very disappointed in Cathay's economy product, which is more 3 than 5 star, certainly on regional routes. The seat pitch was tight and the cabin interior looked old and dated. The food was very basic (chicken and rice plus fruit salad) and drinks choices also limited. The best things about Cathay are the inflight entertainment and the cabin crew service. They seemed genuinely upset when I told them how bad I thought their product was compared to the likes of Emirates and Qatar. I filled in a feedback form and received a standardised, rather complacent, email reply.

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-14;"Cathay is generally very good all around and this trip was down a notch or two for a few reasons : food quality was not up to standard out of LHR  or NRT, though not as bad out of HKG. On HKG-LHR leg though they did not have enough mid-flight meals for all passengers, which I find hard to fathom given people are paying thousands for the ticket and the meal only costs Cathay a few quid to produce. They should overstock, not understock the flight. The other complaint on the trip was the regionally configured plane from NRT-HKG is a poor excuse for business class on a four hour leg. No reason not to run flat beds on that route, considering the importance of it and the fact that some flights are overnight. Won't pay for that again. On the positive side, Cathay service always top notch and efficient.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-14;"Cathay were excellent in all ways apart from the food which has to be the worst airline food I have had. Pasta was burnt to dish, scrambled eggs were tough - very dissapointed. The Premium cabin was comfortable and clean.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-12;"Our annual journey to Vancouver, started this time with a CX flight to Osaka. Newish 777. Plenty of room as flight was not full. Tasty breakfast, good entertainment. Just the typical no hassle flight one comes to expect from this carrier. How we wished we were flying with them back to HKG instead of on disastrous AC. The service is poles apart from check-in to arrival.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-12;"Perfect flight in Premium Economy ZRH-HKG and HKG-ZRH in Seat 34K (last Row). Top Planes, very clean, friendly staff, good food, nice entertainment. Just like expected. Seat is very wide and comfortable compared to Premium Eco with British Airways. Plaza Premium Lounge was very crowded. Luggage arrived very quickly, both in HKG andZRH.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-06;I traveled business class LHR-HKG-SYD on 29/4/15 and returned SYD-HKG-MAN on 11/5/15.I was from Sydney to Hong Kong. The Cabin crew were friendly and helpful with efficient service. Food and service was excellent.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-06;We travelled on 13/4/2015 CX0104 Melb to Hong Kong to Paris Rome to Hong Kong to Melb Premium Economy. My husband was a first time flyer and very nervous about flying. We were shocked when we found we were separated with our seating and they did nothing to change it and we were put in front of the balk head on two of the legs. The food was very ordinary and Economy got the same menu we had to use the economy toilets we didn't have priority boarding on all legs. Cabin staff were very scarce throughout all legs unless they were going from business to the rear of the plane. The final straw was we were given a chocolate with one of our meals and couldn't believe it was 2 years out of date. We were given our last meal 2hrs before we landed at 12 o'clock at night which was unacceptable as we were going home to bed at that time.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-06;We debated the value of Premium Economy for ages before booking our return flights Melbourne to Europe however the added value from the price increase was truly substantial. Much better seat room for both width and recline. Great in-flight service with some really excellent food (albeit average out of Hong Kong) and priority boarding and check-in. The only minor disappointment is the very limited selection of in-flight recent movies. Enough to keep us occupied for both journeys but really not a great deal of choice overall. TV selections and music was better but nothing spectacular.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-06-04;Traveled CX826 Hong Kong 1/5/2015. We started to load late then once we were boarding everyone came forward the whole plane was boarding in one line while a hostess went up the line stamping boarding passes - we must have stood waiting for a good 45 mins. We were in the second last row so we had to struggle past all the others to get to our seats. This flight takes 15 hours so we got two meals in total they did bring a snack but they closed all the blinds and turned off all the lights what snacks there were you couldn't see.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-31;Two trips - LHR-HKG-ICN in April return and one way from ICN-LHR in May - all in Business. First return trip was perfect - 10/10. Very comfortable business class seat and bed good food and attentive service. Only improvement could be to the choice of movies. First trip from ICN-LHR was particularly noteworthy as the first leg was 2.5 hours late due to a thunder storm in Seoul - flight landed in HKG 10 mins after CX255 was supposed to leave but Cathay held that flight which was very impressive and lucky. The ground staff were excellent. The ICN-LHR trip in May was not so fortunate. Due to ATC restrictions over China all flights to Europe were subject to creeping delays - i.e. 30 mins at a time. With the exception of our flight all flights boarded and eventually left - some were up to 4 hours delayed. For some reason CX255 was the only flight not called for boarding and eventually after 5am (4h30m after scheduled departure) the board stated it was est at 0900 the reason being the mandatory crew hours had been reached. I suspect the decision to hold our flight was more about aircraft rotation as that particular aircraft sits on the ground at LHR for 12 hours so effectively CX255 withstand a long delay without suffering a knock on impact to Cathay's schedule. Eventually the flight took off at 0945. Whilst I accept the delay itself was not under Cathay's control the decision to withhold CX255 was not communicated and all passengers were made to wait in the terminal through the night without any offer of accommodation. When on board the flight was perfectly comfortable but my previously flawless image of Cathay's service levels is now tainted.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-31;Travelled on CX100 to Paris on 16 April 2015 and returned CX111 14th May economy class. Both flights were full except for a couple of seats. Overall my trip was average. Limited number of toilets for that many people. Food was minimal and bland compared to other airlines. On my first leg of the trip the sound was not working and the only choice I had was to move to the very back of the plane. It totally spoilt my trip. There was no foot peddle to rest your feet on so the pressure is reduced to the back of the legs. This is very important for 'short people' to reduce the risk of DVT. All other airlines flying the long leg have them. The water given to passengers was very metallic in taste and not drinkable. When we flew out of Hong Kong the security staff suddenly set up a barrier just before entering the plane and confiscated all the passengers water bottles and duty free bottles. How is this acceptable when the duty free stores sell you alcohol only to have this confiscated before boarding. They said this was an Australian ruling. A number of people requested bottles of water when entering the cabin but were refused. Why wasn't there an announcement before entering the aircraft that bottled water was not allowed. I would not have bought my new bottle and OJ prior to boarding. We could only get the 'metal tasting water'. The crew were accommodating but that's all. The seat in front of me did not stay completely upright. The man sitting in it was large but I felt that he would collapse in my lap any moment. The maintenance for the aircraft could have been better.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-31;Travelled Melbourne to London Heathrow via Hong Kong (and return) in business with my elderly mother and my husband. The flights were all busy with the exception of the last leg from Hong Kong to Melbourne however the staff could not have been more helpful. They went out of their way to pay special attention to my mother ensuring she was comfortable and entertained. The service was excellent and the food and wine tasty and very well presented. One of the best things about Cathay business class apart from the service is the space. Plenty of space for everything and seat reclines to a comfortable bed. We would recommend Cathay and will definitely use them again.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-28;CX101 25 May HKG-SYD Airbus 330 Seat 60C. 4 cabin crew members for the whole economy aisle working in pairs. Heavy rain rocky climb so service started later than usual. Crew members working in pairs efficient co- ordinated yet courteous. In the 2nd meal service passengers asleep were woken up gently so as to revert seat back for passengers behind them to eat. Only 5 toilets for the whole economy section. Food of course meagre it is economy class. Seat pitch acceptable. Enjoyable flight. All needs catered for. Due to it being an overnight flight did not try the IFE opted for some sleep instead. Noticed there was no overhead air flow outlet control cabin temperature acceptable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-27;CX110 SYD to Hong Kong on way to Macau 17/5 and return CX 161 on 22/5. Great flight attentive cabin crew clean plane good food and beverage offerings. My first time with Cathay and an enjoyable experience. Lie back seats were interesting. My first experience. Only drawback supposed to leave HKG at gate 67 but changed to Gate 34 thats not a problem except that we were in the CP lounge and no one bothered to tell us. Fortunately one of us went outside to check and found the change. Apart from that oversight a good experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-27;Two of us flew premium economy over a two month period from LHR-Hong Kong HK-Sydney Perth-Hong Kong and Hong Kong-London. Cathay are to be commended on allowing customers seat selection long before you fly at no cost (unlike BA). Staff make this airline - plenty of them attentive smiling and enjoying their job. Throughout the flights the staff are very responsive to any request from your seat for food or assistance. Dinners/lunches are excellent with perfect fish & steaks a great selection of wines/beers and an open galley with a full selection of snacks fruit and drinks. Breakfasts offer a good selection of fruit yoghurt roll and western/eastern options but the sausages are awful! Our last leg was delayed badly by horrendous weather in Hong Kong and although the crew made up for it once airborne it would really help passengers if clear concise information was given to the passengers waiting at the gate. This is a problem with all airlines - no information when things go wrong. IFE was very good premium economy seats are very comfortable and sleeping is easy. Toilet in premium economy is very helpful as is priority boarding ahead of economy. Finally the bag drop off in Hong Kong/Kowloon way ahead of your flight is incredibly convenient. Never lost a bag yet! Good luck Cathay Pacific.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-22;I took the Manila to Hong Kong route on 19 May 2015 and return leg on 21 May 2015. This flight is a 90 minute flight per leg. The first leg was delayed by 40 mins while the second leg was delayed by 3 hours. Service is normal. Overall I'd give it a fail for the kind of delay I faced.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-20;"Flew CX110 SYD-HKG 11 May then KA896 HKG-PVG. Only 40 minutes in transfer between flights. I thought I would miss the connection. On disembarking a sign with the words ""Passenger to Shanghai"" written with a ground staff grouping all Shanghai bound passengers about 5 of us through security express lane then to boarding lounge. This is where CX/KA shine. Had it not been for their expedient service passengers would not have made such a tight connection within 30 minutes since the arrival flight was 10 minutes late. When arrived at the boarding lounge passengers were lining up for boarding. We could just make it. I wonder if Qantas would do the same. In terms of in flight services very friendly. When asked for an extra drink the attendant would come back with one remembering my seat no. Seat pitch acceptable IFE with much to choose from. It is $ well spent and makes one enjoy being their passenger. I felt being looked after well.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-20;Have used this airline fairly extensively as I live in China but my family are in the UK. Found the experience in Business Class somewhat lacking so switched to another airline for a couple of years before trying Cathay again for convenience. Two Hong Kong - Manchester return flights over a three month period left a very bitter taste. Only allowed a very frugal 30kg of luggage in Business Class the Wing Lounge at HK is dirty with worn out furniture tasteless inadequate food on offer that is infrequently replenished managed by sour faced staff. Only Western type meal on board in Business Class was a very small pizza not what I would call an evening meal and insufficient hot breakfast so I went without. On a return flight Business Lounge at Manchester little more than a pokey airless hole with very little on offer. Small baby in Business that proceeded to scream for around 11 hours of the flight and whilst as a mother I am sympathetic to this I haven't paid a small fortune to listen to this in Business Class. Cathay are one of the most expensive Business Class options yet offer sub-standard menus dismal Lounges inadequate baggage allowance and insufficient attention to Business Class travellers who pay for a service that is decidedly lacking!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-20;CX 631 30th April. Very ordinary service. I had high expectations but the airline failed to meet expectations. I had kids traveling and there was no boarding specific for kids. Even during the flight the service was poor for kids. They did not eat and the air hostess did not care. Never going to travel again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-20;Business CX250 London to HK 11 May 2015. Check in at London a breeze. Off to the lounge and a 15 minute walk to the gate. Not complaining as about to sit for 13 hours. Once on board had seats 17K and 18K. The service was excellent and the meals and wine selection was also excellent. Nothing was too much trouble. The inflight entertainment was up to date with the latest movies. Once dinner was over and a few movies it was time to try out their beds. Would not say they are the most comfortable lay flat beds that I have tried but still comfortable enough to grab a few hours sleep. Next morning breakfast was another excellent affair. We were transiting through HK so no baggage to pick up so off to the Wings Club for 6 hours. Overall very happy with the CX experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-20;Very disappointed. The food was terrible staff didn't remove trays. Toilet on one leg at the front of the cabin had to climb over the four front passengers to get to it. On the other leg toilet shared with economy. The only difference to economy is 8 seats across as opposed to 9 in economy. Not a match on Qantas and not worth the money. Would never fly Cathay Pacific again.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-18;Travelled BOM-HKG-PVG and return last week and had a good experience. Food was good and so was the inflight entertainment. Their sister company Dragonair which operated the HKG to PVG leg of the journey was also good especially compared to other Chinese airlines such as China Eastern/Air China which I had used in the past. PVG airport is notorious for flight delays - I happened to reach the airport about 2.5 hours before my scheduled departure. My flight was supposedly going to be delayed & the check in lady offered me an earlier flight if I was ok. I did so gladly and I think that it saved me from missing the connection from HKG. 5 stars to that.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-16;I travelled business class LHR-HKG-SYD on 29/4/15 and returned SYD-HKG-MAN on 11/5/15. Fantastic lie flat bed onboard the 777-300ER and indeed the A330 sector I was on from SYD up to HKG. Cabin crew were efficient and helpful at all times. Food and service were excellent.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-12;Flew premium economy from Melbourne to Hong Kong great seat right in the front of premium economy the seat was just right for my shorter stature. Service was good just right and the hostesses were lovely. No toilet in the premium cabin but did not worry me as a walk stretched the legs. Also flew Hong Kong to Paris and everything was great again different plane which had toilet but I thought this cabin was a little more crowded it was a larger cabin. A few interesting people seated around us but the airline can not help that.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-11;HKG-EWR on frequent flyer ticket. Cathay business layout good for solo travellers and a lie-flat seat I could sleep in. Entertainment was heavy on middle of the road stuff. Good amenity kit. Staff professional although not personal. The main criticism is food. The heating of all elements in a single serving dish is not up with best practice and the results on all meals was mediocre quality. Qantas wins on food hands down.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-11;Just completed an open jaw YVR-HKG-MNL-HKG-LAX combination of Economy and Business Class. I have become very familiar with Cathay's hard products already so I am more keen on the service aspect. Flying out of YVR on CX837 crew were primarily Vancouver-based. Service was top-notch as what one would expect from the World's Best Airline. It is true that the cabin crew were not so visible at the cabin after meal times but press the call button and crew very eager to help will be on your side in a few seconds. Nothing is too much trouble for them even given the most demanding set of passengers-just absolutely polished service. All this applies to all of the sectors I have flown. Only comment probably will be the food-the serving are soo small in Y thanks to the endless bags of chips nuts fruits and chocolate bars in the galley I was able to survive the 13-hour trek across the Pacific Ocean. Overall Cathay is Cathay - the World's best and they continue to deliver these kinds of products and services other airlines can't match.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-10;Brisbane to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Could not fault the service and comfort on this trip. Have travelled before with this airline and have never had any problems.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-10;From Chicago to Hong Kong - the airlines bumped me to Business Class which was great. Hong Kong to Perth sat in purchased premium economy awful! Service was worse than any economy flight I've flown! Meat was so tough I had to shred it and attendants never came by to provide drinks during meal so I had the half cup of warm water! They served 1/2 cup of coffee well after the meal and never returned to offer more cups were still at my seat when the next meal was served! The flight was not full so economy passengers were stretched out to sleep by putting up arm rests which cannot be done in premium economy due to trays being stored in the arm rests. Seats are difficult to push back for anyone not weighing much such as me! So either pay for business class or settle for economy! Staff never strolled through cabin to see if anyone needed anything.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-08;Hong Kong-Rome 2 weeks ago then Zurich-Hong Kong yesterday both on brand new B77W and delayed 1hr each. I fly with CX quite often for long-haul journey only because 1-good safety record 2-low or reasonable fare. Fully understand that I shouldn't expect anything good for other service since it's economy class that's why I bring my own food every time (CX is cutting cost so hard to reduce the food quality and quantity) seat is uncomfortable and no service from cabin crew except the dinner/light breakfast time. AVOD is very good.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-08;Cebu to HK (CX926) check in was fast and friendly clean newest aircraft seat comfortable no champagne food was exactly the same as economy class quite disappointed really. In my humble opinion it just not worth flying premium class for a two hour trip. HK to London (CX255) quite disappointed compare to my excellent flight to HK The seats was a little worn and hard the cabin had a lot of scruff marks one hot towel before dinner and one hot towel before breakfast dinner was good breakfast wasn't. Hardly saw any cabin crew between dinner and breakfast. I really do feel they need to make the premium class a little bit special small touches such as proper cups for tea or coffee proper glass and not plastic cup for drinks armchair style seats perhaps in leather would be nicer the TV was awkward to raise (seat 30G) dinner tray was a tad too small charging point for mobile phone was awkward. Flying again next month in business class.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-06;JFK-HKG-CMB-HKG-JFK B777-300ER and A330-300 JFK-HKG in First and the three other flight segments in Business Class. One World Mileage Redemption Award through AA. JFK check-in was excellent and CX uses the BA First Class Lounge that has room for improvement to be more like LHR T5. Boarding was not well organized but First Class on board was outstanding as always though the menu selections aren't quite as good as a few years ago. The wines and other beverage choices were excellent. Hong Kong's CX Wing First Class Lounge was excellent and their Cabanas are great for rest and showering/bathing. The non-stop flight from HKG to CMB had the new Business Class seats while the flight back from CMB to HKG had Regional Business Class seats due to a one hour stop in BKK therefore not considered long haul. The new Business Class seat (was also on the plane from HKG-JFK) is very well designed with much storage space though the cushion is not the softest and there is an awkward angled step in the foot well floor just in front of the footrest. Meal service was good and the staff was efficient while most were friendly and helpful. All the planes were clean and the toilets were maintained well throughout the flights. I used the UL Serendib Lounge in CMB due to my OW Emerald Tier status knowing that the Araliya Lounge used by most airlines is very average. Luggage transferred without any problems and was delivered promptly. JFK Immigration and Customs staff was efficient and polite. Will definitely use CX again as I have regularly since 2008.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-04;CX731 HKG-DXB Business Class. I had booked a one way ticket in Premium Economy using the last of my Asiamiles which were expiring soon. I have been a CX Marco Polo club member since inception and flew business and first regularly when I was based in Hong Kong several years ago. But being based in Dubai for the past few years I had not flown CX in a long while. To my delight and surprise when I checked in at the airport in HKG the check-in agent gave me a business class boarding card. I was surprised because my ticket was not a full revenue ticket and had been purchased with miles. This is what sets CX apart from the rest. Unlike other airlines including one prominent one from SE Asia CX remembers your loyalty even from way back in the past and rewards passengers like myself. This has happened to me several times when I was based in HKG but to do this to a formerly loyal passenger on a non-revenue ticket simply took my breath away. Needless to say the service and food were flawless and I greatly enjoyed my trip. Thank you CX! I will always remember this.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-04;Business Class Sydney-Hong Kong-Paris: Zurich-Hong Kong-Sydney. The overall experience was faultless. The seating arrangement was equal or better than other first class offerings we have experienced. It was 1-2-1 seating arrangement and my wife and I each chose a window seat as it offered maximum privacy. Every imaginable position was comfortable be it sitting sleeping or anywhere in between. Storage compartments for every feasible object positioned conveniently all around. Plenty of good lighting options for whatever you choose to do. Cabin crew service was attentive friendly and professional. Food and drinks all of a high standard with any little extra requirement taken care of if at all possible.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-02;20 April 2015 CX252 and 21st April CX921. LHR to HKG to Cebu. I had a good deal with my Premium Economy and Business class ticket however this was the best so far staff were exceptionally good this time making sure we were well supplied with drinks and snacks etc. The entertainment was excellent. Food is pretty good too. Business Class from HKG to Cebu is excellent as my many previous reviews.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-02;Having flown the very long haul JFK-HKG flight (15 hours) with the newer reclining seats and the older shell seats on short HKG-MNL flight (2 hours) the newer reclining seats are uncomfortable and have no privacy. The shell design seats were more comfortable between the two. The newer seat design reclines six inches right onto your knees if you are an average sized person. So much so I had to notify the flight attendant to instruct the person sitting in front of me not to recline fully because I literally could not move. This is inexcusable. The seat pad is so thin the underside of my legs began to ache in an hour with a genuinely painful posterior another hour later. There is little privacy with these seats because the seatback tops are small and have space gaps between them that put the AV screen in the next row in your line of sight. It is even worse when the person in front reclines. The miniature storage caddy below the AV screen is handy for storing glasses small documents etc though it protrudes a bit too much into the personal space in front of the seat. All-in-all these seats were poorly designed and tested and very uncomfortable for long haul flights. The recline needs to be reduced to 3 inches more and better padding is needed for the seat cushions and adjustments needs to be made to reduce the protrusion of the seatback in front of you into your personal space. The storage caddy sticks out too far the seatback pocket area as well. The rails that attach the seat to the plane on the floor are not positioned for seat comfort either. The fixed shell seats HKG-MNL were more comfortable because of the pseudo leather material covering them. Also the top of the seat was fuller giving one more privacy from the AV screens and passengers sitting in the next row. It seemed like they had an extra inch of pitch compared to the newer reclining seats but that may be just because of the limited simpler seatback design (no storage caddy). Food all the way through was average to below average. A fifteen hour flight ought to have three meals rather than the two they served. In the many hours in between meals there were few snacks and they disappeared quickly and were not replenished. The snacks were highly salty such as the heavily blanched peanuts. Several bags of them almost made you dehydrate. They did not taste right. I made the mistake of ordering a kosher meal on one segment and it was very bland and had stiff tasteless crackers. The one that had salmon had been pilfered so they returned it for a regular meal. The seatback AVOD needs to have more classic movie selections documentaries etc. It is also too difficult to navigate the AVOD screen and one often has to press the touch screen several times to get a button to take. Service on the flights was above average. The flight attendants and pilot crew were professional efficient and pleasant. While they were very busy the flight attendants were responsive as they could be in such a busy atmosphere. The gate agents were pleasant attentive to detail and efficient. All the CX we encountered were above average in their professionalism and service. If it were not for very uncomfortable seats and their lack of privacy and the below average food and inadequate snacks the service would lift the experience to 4 of 5 stars. CX needs to customer test the seats and food and improve them to be a four or five star experience.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-05-01;HKG-SIN on A330-300 CX735 business class. Food was okay limited choice there were only two mains to choose from. Not what I expected compared to what I had served on Singapore. Was given a plastic eyes mask cabin crew could be friendlier.;NEGATIVE

I enjoyed the attention from the airline crew both at check in and inflight the inflight service was great with a good choice of meals and drinks. The seating position was good the flat bed was ok may be not the best but good enough. You have loads of storage space and the headphones do work and are of premium standard.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-27;Premium economy service downgraded. I have been a regular customer on Cathay Pacific's premium economy between Perth and Hong Kong and I have been very happy with the service until now. On my last flight Perth to Hong Kong instead of the usual hot or cold breakfast options we were given a box containing a pastry fruit salad in a tiny dish and a chocolate bar The same meal was served to economy passengers. when I asked the flight attendant where was the hot food I was informed that there had been a change to the service. Downgrade more like it. I asked for a glass of Champagne and that was served in a plastic cup. On the return sector Perth to Hong Kong we were given a hot lunch which was quite good and then around 9pm they came down with a box containing the worlds smallest chicken roll some fruit salad in a tiny plastic container and a chocolate bar. Cathay Pacific is a premium airline this food is not fit for economy let alone premium economy. They seem to have downgraded the service but not discounted the price of the ticket. I will be flying back to Hong Kong next week it will be interesting to see if they have lifted the standard of meals back to what it once was.;NEGATIVE

I've flown to Australia 3 times now my experience with Cathay was ok I'm 6""1 the seats were comfy the leg room was ok. I like the 3-3-3 config which makes a huge difference. Meals were nice IFE was good. Snacks were just crisps nuts and apples. I would fly Cathay again if the price was right.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-24;My wife and I flew from Helsinki via Frankfurt and Hong Kong to Ho-Chi Minh City in Vietnam. Flight from HEL to FRA was operated by Finnair and was comfortable as always although the menu prices (especially for drinks) are completely ridiculous. The long legs FRA-HKG-HMC (and back) were operated by Cathay and I must say that I really enjoyed flying with them. The service was excellent and food was really good (comparable to Emirates). IFE was excellent with a pretty wide choice of movies which partly were at that time still showing in the cinemas in Finland. Best part of the flight was the seat. I'm approx. 1.90m tall so I appreciate the room that Cathay is giving the passengers even in Economy. Additionally seats were very comfortable and wide so I could get a good sleep on the long-haul flights. We ran into some pretty heavy turbulence somewhere over the Himalayas and the captain was constantly making announcements as to what was happening. After it was getting too tough they decided to change the route which eventually resulted in a slightly delayed arrival in HKG but a much more relaxed flight. I'm already looking forward to flying Cathay again this year and can highly recommend the airline.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-23;Hong Kong - Sydney (CX139 - Boeing 777-300ER 3 Class). An overall excellent flight with an excellent selection of movies music and games on the seatback IFE. Food was excellent and was presented in a way that make it look like something that is edible. Cathay has never fails to deliver the service needed for a five star airline. The seats were comfortable enough allowing me to catch up on my sleep. However this time around the cabin crew seemed annoyed but did the best to hide it. It was noticeable that the FA's were tired and wished to go to sleep at anytime. But they did their best to hide it which is commendable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-23;CX252 12 March 2015 LHR-HKG. An excellent service in economy class. Personally being taller than average I miss the clam seat since if the person in front reclines the restriction in legroom is annoying. Unlike other airlines it is not leg breaking just annoying. Food and entertainment are excellent in flight snack selection is 1st class (noodle soup and fresh fruit) and staff are superb. A model for any other airline - don't fly everywhere but make sure the service you supply where you do fly is tip-top regardless of class. Even better - the entertainment system takes standard headphone jack so you can bring your own. Its a long old flight but Cathay make me wish it lasted another two or three hours.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-19;"CX736 and CX715 from SIN to HKG. I have to say I've been on a few flights in the past year and in my opinion Cathay Pacific is comparable to a low cost carrier. I've been on All Nippon Airways and Korean Air and I expected that Cathay Pacific would do much better since it's been regarded as the best airline in the world so of course I would have high expectations. But no and here's why: 1) I did not feel welcome from the moment I checked in up to the point I exited the aircraft the atmosphere was ""cold"" to say the least. Half of the cabin crew were robotic and the service felt really off to me. 2) Food there was no problem with the dinner they served but what annoyed me was the fact that their cutlery was made of plastic. I hate eating with plastic forks and spoons and I was appalled that a five star airline would have the audacity to use plastic tools for people to eat with. 3) In- flight entertainment not up to standard. the content was fine but the equipment was not. It is exactly the type that Jetstar uses and I hate the fact that there were no buttons and that everything was touchscreen. My complaints may seem petty to some individuals but I strongly believe that these three components are some of the basic foundation that defines an airline.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-14;I went with Cathay on a Regional flight from Singapore to Bangkok with their A330. It was an excellent flight. Service was very good food was tasty and drinks felt carefully selected. Screens were good and I could charge my phone by using the USB-contact. Only negative: there was not able to watch films during this short flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-14;Ho Chi Minh City to Hong Kong with Economy class. Beside getting the excellent service from ground staff and flight attendants the rest of my experience was no good. Flight was delayed for almost three hours from HCMC-HK then delayed for 1.5 hours from HK-HCMC. Selection of beverages was minimal alcohol was not offered unless you asked for it and the inflight food was awful. I do not think I will fly with this airline again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-12;Melbourne - Shanghai via HK and return same route. Had very high expectations of this airline and class judging by the reviews here. For the most part I would have to agree. Cathay Pacific are very good airline and the business class experience is quite fine. Check in smooth and quick virtually no waiting at all and same for express card at immigration. At lounge in Melbourne we were greeted and shown the lounge and told we'd be advised when the flight was ready for boarding. Pretty good selection of reading material strong Wi-Fi and food selection both western and eastern all up a positive experience. HK lounges similar set up and look but bigger and more choices etc. On board was similarly great. Huge amount of room in overhead locker as in business you are not sharing. My jacket was taken off me without asking and stored for the flight. Offered a selection of drinks before flight and shortly after take-off personally welcomed on board. A Nice touch. Lovely hot towels before eating and after eating always a plus. The seat is exactly as you imagine. Large comfortable with plenty of room. Try as I might you just can't touch the next seat ahead of you. Controls simple and easy to use. The screen and entertainment system pretty good but I'd have to say Emirates is better for variety and information. Dinner was served pretty quickly as this was an after midnight departure. Fresh white linen is placed on tray table and simple design of unfussy crockery and cutlery. Lots of attention given with plenty of staff for the cabin always not far away should need them. On the food front I'd say it was tasty and plentiful but not exactly what I'd call luxurious but definitely a step up from economy as it should be. Breakfast approaching HK was better. Fresh juice and smoothies both cold and hot food to eat and a selection of three choices are offered. In terms of the fully reclined bed I couldn't fault the bed itself. I was surprised how far it kept going back. In fact I actually brought up slightly to give my body some support as fully flat felt a little like laying on the floor. I'd also say the cavity where you place your feet is far too hot. Both my partner and I felt a bit like our legs were on fire. That combined with the warmth of the duvet provided made it too warm. This should be addressed somehow. Disembarking is a quick and part of the advantage of flying in this class. Overall it's a very comfortable and spacious flying experience. This seat is used as a first class product by Dragon Air the sister airline and in fact the feel and cabin does feel very first class if a little spartan and pared back. Overall I'd recommend the crew airline and experience. Food cabin temperature aside it's well worth flying business class particularly if you can take advantage of the seat / bed.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-12;Flight 500 / Japan Airlines Flight 7048. HKG-NRT B777-300. Be aware that: Seats 46AK and 49AK are window seats without windows on Cathay's Boeing 777-300. Hard shells weren't too bad afterall on a short haul 4 hour flight. Although seats don't recline and the person at the front won't lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I don't feel relaxed. On the other hand seat legroom was acceptable but not satisfactory enough. Seat width was good. The entertainment system or AVOD has limited choice and the screen wasn't sensitive enough. The AC power socket provided was not working at my seat. For the food it was Fish w/ Rice or Chicken w/ Pasta both with salad bread a drink and Haagen Dazs as dessert. The crew were friendly and willing to help. In general the flight was on time and was earlier than expected. Everything was OK and above average and were up to standards as a 5-star airline. However there is still room for improvement. CX is reliable and I will travel with CX again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-12;I have travelled on CX flights every year since 2004 and I am a Marco Polo member but I do not find any difference in the staff service. When I asked for a comment form the flight managers kept asking to find out what comments I would be writing. Though I had asked for a change of seats on 2 of my flights because there were empty seats. I was told to wait until the door was closed. I waited but the seats were taken by other passengers before the airplane's door was closed though I asked before them. When I was upgraded to business class the hostess chose to give me the noodles burnt and oily dumplings for breakfast. When I asked for a noodle snack (in premium economy) the hostess refused to serve me claiming that breakfast would be served in an hour (actually 1.5 hours later). The staff did not ask what drinks I would like and they just served whatever they liked.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-08;Sydney to Hong Kong. Regular CX passenger. Chaotic boarding which is unusual. Bus class cabin as good as ever and the new amenity kit is a vast improvement. Lovely staff although the cabin service director oddly absent Will always recommend Cathay for the consistent good crews and great hard product. Only the food is terrible and sadly that is consistent. No salt and pepper shakers in bus class is just dumb and the plastic packets you get if you ask for are too coarse and would embarrass Economy class.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-04;HKG to Newark premium economy cabin showed as full was actually quiet. Really all you get is a better seat and more space. Bathroom is actually quite a way back in economy. Good food excellent CX service as usual they were very present during long flight making lots of runs. Very helpful with the ancient Americans who seemed to have a wide range of special needs and requests. The front section of economy is not really that different to premium. On time pilot updated regularly and all in all much better than other option United. Lounge in HK fantastic but really too busy as many members get there very early to spend 4 hours or so there.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-01;BNE-TPE return (via Hong Kong) in Economy. I feel like CX has improved its service as we received average to above average service on all flights (whereas previously service was just poor). In particular cabin crew between HKG and TPE were excellent. Connections in Hong Kong were seamless and easy with CX carrying everything off with professionalism. IFE options are varied and entertaining and the dining options seem to have improved with 3 choices for the main meal and also Haagen Dazs ice cream served for dessert. Flights all reasonably on time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-04-01;BNE-HKG-BNE in Premium Economy (and then to Hanoi on Hong Kong Airlines for a change). Cathay Premium Economy never seems to vary: good food good service passable wine (albeit in a plastic cup) and quite good seating. A negative is that the Cathay Pacific web-site often shows premium economy as being already completely full when looking at potential flights and selecting seats when in fact it isn't full at all. I wonder how many customers Cathay are losing because of this. They've lost me this time because of this odd problem and I will head to Hong Kong and back on Qantas next time. Otherwise a good reliable airline overall.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-26;We flew LHR-HKG and HGK-SYD 11/12 January 2015. We were previously booked on Malaysian Airlines and took the option from Flight Centre to change after their misfortunes during 2014. Wish we had stayed with Malaysian. Found Cathay Pacific in-flight service and overall comfort to be far inferior to our previous international flights with both Singapore Airlines and Thai Airways. In addition we booked and paid for extra leg-room on the legs to/from Australia. When checking-in at LHR I noticed that we had not been allocated these seats and to make matters worse my wife and I were allocated different rows. Upon questioning this I was told that HKG was not open at that time so take it up with them when we arrive. The flight was delayed and upon arrival in HKG we were quickly and rudely ushered to our awaiting flight to SYD. The Cathay staff at the Gate would not assist even though they admitted a mistake had been made and other people were now in the seats we paid for but they would not move them. We therefore spent the flight crammed into the middle of the middle rows in seats several rows apart. Never again will we fly with Cathay Pacific and very little positive to say based on our experiences.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-26;HKG to BKK economy good seat at front of cabin TV AVOD old and a bit limited but fine for a short flight. Great service on both flights. Food and drinks fast wine and coffee plentiful. Crew always reply with a smile and a good attitude. I had more legroom than the premium crowd in front of me. Lounge in BKK - considering the high number of flights the lounge is really basic. The priority pass one is much better small crowded limited food and drinks. They also allow other airlines like Sri Lankan to use it too. They really need a decent lounge there to cope with the many flights to HK.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-25;JFK-HKG-SIN return. Transpacific legs in F on the 773ER. Cathay continues to be the standard bearer for international first class travel maybe SQ the only other true contender. FAs are excellent food and drink are superb AVOD is well-stocked and diverse. Hard product is excellent from mattress pad to duvet to pillow. Slept a solid 8 hours uninterrupted on each flight. Lounges at HKG are well above average but you need to know which to visit as there are many. The Wing and The Bridge are standouts for F and J travel respectively. For flights to SIN and back 777 and A330 planes in regional 3-class configuration without F were used. J class on these flights featured the older recliner product but this was comfortable enough for the roughly 3 hour flight. Food and drink were decent far better than what's found in J on other airlines. Only place CX needs to improve is on the boarding process. Is often chaotic and poorly managed. If they can get that in order they would be the best airline in the world in my opinion.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-23;I flew from SYD to LHR in Premium Economy. I was very disappointed. I paid the extra over economy for the extra legroom (tick) but also for the dedicated bathroom and premium service. On the SYD to HK leg we had to use the crowded economy toilets. The HKG to LHR we had a decimated bathroom - but lengthy queue as economy passengers were waking up and using it. This was not policed by the flight attendants. The food was also the same as economy with no top up of your wine during dinner. Overall not worth the extra. Cathay should travel on Qantas Premium Economy to see how it should operate. Never again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-20;We flew LHR-HKG HKG-MNL and then back and on both journeys the flight was excellent. I have flown with many airlines in different classes including first and the service on this flight was by far the best I've experienced. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment was great. I can't wait to fly Cathay again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-18;After reading so many negative reviews was worried about this flight. Pleased to report that I completely disagree. Yes you could complain that the attendants aren't running around after you like they do in business but that's churlish. Food is great IFE excellent and seat reclines nicely enough to get a bit of sleep. Best of all even if the people in front recline they're not actually in your lap like some people here have said. I sat on the back row and would choose the same seats again. Flight was full both ways and at around $3.5k well worth the extra and I'd struggle to pay double that just to be able to lie down which is pretty much the only.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-17;CMB-BKK on CX700. I came with high expectations and fond memories of flights I took with Cathay Pacific around 5 years ago but was in for a shock. Seated on seat 59C (exit aisle) the seat when reclined designed in such a way that it pushes your head down. The 'Asian vegetarian meal' was some stale disgusting tasting bread with some cheap margarine one piece of lettuce and a tiny piece of boiled zucchini. Tea was super strong and a sickly sweet Thai made apple concentrate juice was given. Worst of all the water was like nothing I ever experienced anywhere let alone on an airline. It smelt like highly chlorinated swimming pool water and I flushed it down the toilet. Cabin crew were efficient in a typically Chinese way but completely under motivated. They looked exhausted from what I suspect is a heavy load of flights. No immigration cards were given the inflight magazine is a joke and the plane heating system seemed noisier than usual (though I may be biased due to the overall experience). A world class airline? I don't think so!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-17;Flew Cathay business class A330 from ICN to HKG return. Very good cordial service and knew my name. Seat has lots of space. IFE is superb and food very good. HKG lounge was overcrowded but on a Friday night this is often the case. Seat has lots of room. A fantastic experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-17;Flew DXB-HKG-BNE return all on the A330-300. Much better price than EK even though its not non stop. Service is excellent the business cabin seats are very comfortable with flat lie beds same style as AA's new B777-300. Food is good and plenty of it. The cabin crew on all legs were friendly and efficient. IFE is good nice big screens and a good enough selection. Didn't spend much time in the lounges in HK but of the time spent they are good. CX use the BA lounge in DXB which is just about ok. In BNE they use the Qantas lounge which is again ok apart from the rude staff. I will definitely fly with CX again and cant recommend them enough they are all round excellent.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-17;Geneva to Hong Kong and return via London in C-Class. Outbound was ok but nothing special. Return was really poor. The food choice was poor and they ran out of the prime dish. Staff were not welcoming and were cold. Asked if I could dine a bit later but that was refused. They appeared twice. Once for lunch once for dinner. Will go back to Swiss.;NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-09;CX105 Hong Kong to Melbourne. Flight was on time and the seat was comfortable. Not very noisy I slept well. The food was good they offered both western style food and eastern style food.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-09;Flew SYD-HKG HKG-EWR JFK-HKG HKG-SYD between Feb 9 to Mar 1. First time flying with this airline a really pleasant experience. Paid AU$1600 five months in advance making it only $400 for each long flight great value. Ground and flight crew were all professional and hospitable. Ticked all the right boxes in terms of IFE catering seat comfort and cabin cleanliness. Enjoyed the view via the exterior camera flying over Alaska and Greenland on the 777-300ER. Couldn't ask for much more as an economy passenger won't hesitate flying Cathay again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-04;I had written my experiences in Business Class EWR-HKG-EWR a few months ago. At that time. I wasn't impressed with the service food and everything about Cathay Pacific. I assumed that it was a fluke and used Cathay again with the same itinerary. It wasn't a fluke! I can't believe that this is one of the best business class airlines. The reviews are very good except for the North American flights. In any event I'll switch to United in the future. At least I'll know their short comings.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-04;Flew business class from London to Sydney via Hong Kong this week. London to Hong Kong sector very comfortable with flat bed cubicle. A few things missing no PJS nor pre orderings drinks as is the case with Qantas and Virgin. Second leg HK to Sydney - huge disappointment. The airline switched aircraft's at very last minute meaning business class (read premium economy) had no flat bed cubicles just seats. No passengers were advised ahead of time and the response to my complaint letter said the airline was sorry but nothing could be done about it.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-04;LHR-HKG (B777) then HKG-PER (A330) and return. Business class. (No First Class on the aircraft I used). Both aircraft's are similar from the point of view of the seat itself and the service you get although the A330 seat is slightly smaller but that is only really noticeable in the smaller side-cupboard by the seat. Storage is impressive and is everywhere. The headphone cabinet has more storage space too and it has a mirror. Seat firm but comfortable. You don't get pyjamas or a mattress with business class with Cathay only in their First Class. Initially I was miffed but actually I didn't notice not having the mattress and I slept well. The amenity kit has ear plugs anyway. Cathay dining is esoteric and not always to a western palate. It is served from a trolley so you get to see the product before you select it which is rather good. Cathay service is practical and competent but I feel that it is not polished like say BA or Emirates. I chose Cathay because I wanted the best seat for a 24 hr flight and in that respect any short-comings in other departments (food no mattress humourless but efficient staff) are insignificant: these seats will get you there in comfort. I was most impressed and will use them again. The seat does it for me - it is what makes a difference after the flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-04;Having flown a number of legs on CX recently I've been mostly impressed by both the seats and the service. I flew on the B777-300 ER and the regional A330 and the service was good on all legs. The seats on the long haul B777s are excellent with plenty of storage space and an excellent entertainment system with a huge choice of movies TV and music. My only disappointment was with the food. The choice is limited (no choice offered for appetisers this always appears to be a form of smoked salmon) and having sampled most of the dishes offered none were particularly impressive. This appears to be at odds with the level of service offered by the airline. The food at the lounges in HKIA in particular at The Wing remains excellent. Other than the average food CX are an excellent airline and the seats and service are about as good as it gets in the air.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-03-04;Our kids are scattered around the world to the extent that the best way to visit them is a round-the-world ticket which makes for a horrendous trip. No trip is without it's troubles: in flight problems being rough weather screaming baby kicking your kidneys from behind / super sized passenger demanding you don't recline your seat or delays caused by drunken passengers/ flight staff not turning up / broken equipment. My aim is to look for the least unpleasant trip providers whilst doing all that I can to minimise inconvenience and discomfort for me fellow travellers and employees. Cathay Pacific seems to be the least traumatic way of doing this. I have travelled with them and many other carriers over the last fifteen years and consider them the best staff very helpful and non-confrontational when things go wrong (eg dealing effectively with abusive drunk). And I will try to avoid American Airways for the Atlantic leg who exceeded my expectations of how bad a flight could be (thankfully 'only' a short seven hour hop).;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-24;Travelled from SIN-HKG and back. Check-in counter waiting time really efficient at Hong Kong Airport Express station and Singapore is really efficient. Aboard flight good movies and TV shows shown on StudioCX and the food was very fresh and tasty. Good flight attendant service with the newest economy class. Clean cabin and toilet and quiet flying experience on Airbus A330-300. I think CX should improve on the array of movies and TV shows as they are fewer than other airlines. but so far I am satisfied on both flights.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-24;I travelled Manchester - Sydney return on 777-300 ER. The service was mediocre on 3 of the 4 legs with a poor selection of food warm champagne and no single malts. The crew were almost robotic and did not show any real deep customer care. The service was rushed and served without any finesse unlike Singapore and Emirates. The new seat/bed was ok but felt tight and squeezed in. Obviously on this airline they have crammed in as many seats as possible with no space to move around the plane. I am 1.80 in height and slim and getting in and out of my seat 17K unless the seat was completely upright was a struggle. Boarding on all 4 legs as a BC passenger was chaotic and a stress. In Hong Kong it was unbelievable. 14 staff and not one singing off the same hymn sheet. Also in HK no one welcomed us onboard either on entry or when we were seated. The crew manager spent all her time at the front of the plane and never entered to serve or speak with the passengers in any class on the HK to Manchester leg on 18 Feb 2015. She was unapproachable and aloof. The business class lounge at Manchester was a joke and in Hong Kong was nice when inside the staff were distant and robotic. In Sydney we used the Qantas lounge winch was a delight. I would not spend £3700 with this airline again but will travel Singapore or Emirates BC when I travel long haul and wouldn't use Manchester again I'll travel through Heathrow.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-24;This airline came highly recommended by friends and I think they must have flown a different airline to me. I recently had 4 international flights with Cathay all of which were late for take off. Our first flight MEL to Hong Kong (late out of MEL) was pleasant the staff were attentive the service went downhill from there. Honk Kong - New York late for take off which caused problems at the New York end having to pay a waiting fee for car service. London-Hong Kong an unpleasant trip staff tired and grumpy from the start toilets dirty and smelly and again a late take off. Hong Kong-MEL well what can I say late take off again (almost an hour). Staff should find another job if they don't want to do long haul flights unpleasant to the point of being down right rude. Toilets were absolutely disgusting. The only saving grace of this airline was the seats enough room to stretch and get some sleep. My expectation is that flights take off on time and an occasional late take off is acceptable but come Cathay 4 late take offs in one trip really is a bit much.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-24;I used to travel CX regularly in the decade 1984-1994 when I lived in Hong Kong. This was my first time in 20 years traveling round-trip to Melbourne from London. The lounges were generally goodwith decent Chinese food but little or no choice in wines. On board I found the seats comfortable. The service was polite and generally efficient. I didn't see much spontaneity or anticipation: You end up having to ask for what you want. The main disappointment was the food particularly from HK to Melbourne and back. It wasn't terrible but it was worse than I remember it 30 years ago. I'd certainly fly Cathay again but I was surprised not to find it better than BA.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;Travelled on CX358 from Manchester to Singapore via Hong Kong that should have left on the 29th. The airport experienced some delays due to snow and was closed for a while. I have no problems with the delay as you can't help what the weather brings however we were boarded onto the plane where we sat for 6 hours going nowhere. Cathay have their own infrastructure in Manchester airport supplied by Airline Services who simply couldn't cope with the amount of planes that needed to be de-iced. Cathay did little to keep us informed and when the flight was subsequently cancelled we got off and put up in a Hotel in Manchester for the night. The following day we did eventually leave but the knock on effect of the delay was now felt by the flight when we arrived in Hong Kong there were no connecting flights and the ground staff were overwhelmed with trying to get us all sorted out so spent another day in HK airport. Yes the planes are comfortable the food was quite good as were the facilities but their being able to work under pressure was very disappointing and frustrating also they do not accept the fact they could have done better.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;AKL-HKG and BOM-HKG-LAX. A340 from Auckland to Hong Kong has old coffin class seats. Still comfortable enough. A330 from Mumbai and B777 to LAX. Seats are very comfortable and easy to get some sleep. Crew were excellent on all sectors. The IFE selection was not as good as American B773. Overall great product and very consistent.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;Flight CX561 KIX (Osaka)-HKG. Another excellent flight by Cathay Pacific. On time departure and arrival. Very smooth flight. Very good staff services seat arrangement and inflight entertainment. Food was good as well.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;We flew in Business on the new direct flight from Manchester to Hong Kong. I have to say that this is the best Business Class I've flown on and is realistically just about as good as BA's First Class. The seat is huge wider than BA's First Class seat and wider than any Business Class seat bar Singapore. The food is very good (though in all fairness not great). On board entertainment is good. The seats are apart from being really really wide are amazingly simple to operate. None of the over-complicated devices that take half a flight to figure out how to use. Service is good though in one direction a bit cold and stand-offish (though still efficient). The HK lounge is good though obviously not as nice as the Cathay First Class lounge The Wing. But for Business Class pretty good indeed. The only downside is cost. This was a fair bit more expensive than most of the other Business Class options to HK though it is the only direct flight so worth the extra to avoid a change of planes. I can definitely recommend Cathay's Business Class.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;Return flight form HKG to LAX. I have no issues with the seats and food but the service is very poor. When I got to my seat I requested one of the cabin stewardess to help me store my cabin bag. The answer I got from her was shocking she said she would do it later together with me! I can understand that she might not be strong or tall enough to (like myself) but she could either ask for another stewardess or a steward to help. Even budget airlines help with the cabin bags.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;After paying to go premium Economy we did not get any extra service. We had to use the economy toilets quite away back in the plane. We have always flown with Qantas before and the cabin crew pay a lot of attention to you even though you are Premium Economy. They came round with water and snacks. We only saw the cabin crew when we first got on the 4 planes (Heathrow to Hong Kong-Hong Kong to Brisbane and returning again) and other than for meals.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;Round trip First class New York (JFK) to Hong Kong (HKG) via Vancouver (YVR). In general service is as not as polished as before. Beverage options are still good. Catering is deteriorating. Compared to the same flights I took a couple of months a go Cathay cuts back significantly including: 1) Studio CX magazine a entertainment supplement for First and Business passengers. 2) They also downgrade First class amenity kit from Zegna to Aesop. The design of amenity kit is boring and the color scheme is unimpressed. 3) Cathay also cut down amuse-bouche between JFK and YVR. 4) No welcome drink departing from JFK. On the flight to HK the purser warned me that HK headquarter changed the new menu this month. They used to cater lobster and prime ribs steaks as entrée but they were replaced by fish and chicken. I tried both chicken and fish and sadly to report both are not great. CX switches crew in Vancouver. In general HK-based crew were more polished and tip-top though can be more formal. Vancouver-based are more casual laid-back and chatty which I actually prefer. Sometimes they are too casual and forget some details including refilling Champagne leading First class passengers to their seats and placing welcome card etc..… CX also fails to deplane first class passengers first and let them wait after business class passengers. Having said that the seat is spacious and comfortable.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;Travelled on CX358 from Manchester to Singapore via Hong Kong that should have left on the 29th. The airport experienced some delays due to snow and was closed for a while. I have no problems with the delay as you can't help what the weather brings however we were boarded onto the plane where we sat for 6 hours going nowhere. Cathay have their own infrastructure in Manchester airport supplied by Airline Services who simply couldn't cope with the amount of planes that needed to be de-iced. Cathay did little to keep us informed and when the flight was subsequently cancelled we got off and put up in a Hotel in Manchester for the night. The following day we did eventually leave but the knock on effect of the delay was now felt by the flight when we arrived in Hong Kong there were no connecting flights and the ground staff were overwhelmed with trying to get us all sorted out so spent another day in HK airport. Yes the planes are comfortable the food was quite good as were the facilities but their being able to work under pressure was very disappointing and frustrating also they do not accept the fact they could have done better.;NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-18;MNL-HGK-BAH. Experienced Business Class this time. 5 stars from A-Z. Cabin Crew service was spot on as usual. Excellent line up for their inflight entertainment. Seat is superb. Food was great. Overall I am a very satisfied passenger.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-11;Malaysia - HK Return. Check-in process was smooth and boarding on time. MY - HK new airbus new TV screens new seats and the entire plane looked fresh which I think it's a good thing. Staff were friendly and efficient. Food and beverages were good. Inflight entertainment is good. HK - MY sharing planes it was an old Boeing and the flight was so full. My friends and I all seated differently. Landing was rough.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-11;"Consistency on the ""soft product"" seems to be the biggest problem with CX. I flew CX Business Class on 12/26 then CX First Class on the return flight on 12/31. On the outbound flight the crew was pretty good. No matter how hard I try I just can't get used to the ""ignore you unless you push the call button"" service approach. Having said that I thought the attendants in biz made a few passes through the cabin to see if passengers needed anything. On the return flight in first there was one attendant that was great! The other was somewhere between ""meh"" and annoying. She was determined to get my meal order right away despite the fact I told her a few times that I wasn't quite ready to eat. It wasn't just an unobtrusive ""ready to order yet?"" It was ""I need to get this meal prepared!"" (presumably so she could then relax). I think she came back 4 or 5 times and pushed for the order! Finally I just gave in! Anyway overall CX is pretty good. My problem is that with their reputation comes high expectations and it's almost impossible for them not to disappoint in some way. Really the food and drinks are a cut above almost any other airline and the hard product - the seat - is outstanding.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-11;Our second experience flying with Cathay Pacific. Flew Manchester to Narita via Hong Kong and return in Business (January 2015). The service food and seat were all excellent on outbound and inbound legs on the 777-300 apart from the Hong Kong to Narita leg which was a regional configuration. I found the shell seat to be a little uncomfortable as I am 5ft 3in and could not get the leg rest to a comfortable angle with my legs and feet left dangling. Cathay uses a third party lounge at Manchester Terminal 2 which was small but adequate for a light breakfast. A member of Cathay ground staff escorted us all from the lounge to the boarding gate and we were boarded before the other passengers. A short transfer at HKG but the Wing lounge was very crowded. The First Class lounge was being upgraded so First passengers were allocated half of the Wing business section. It was almost impossible to find a seat. The return leg we found the Cathay lounge at Narita quite disappointing so used the JAL lounge instead which had a better selection of food and more comfortable seating. Boarding was a shambles however as we were called to the gate early. The flight was not yet open for boarding and the gate area was not big enough to accommodate everyone. Although there was a separate First/Business boarding lane this was so clogged with Economy passengers the staff gave up and just let everyone through regardless. However once on board the service was excellent and luckily the 777-300 had the long haul flat-bed seats. Transit through HKG was swift and we decided to use the Bridge lounge which was not very crowded and had a very good selection of food and drinks. We had time for a shower and relax before the HKG-MAN flight at 01.00 am. Unfortunately when we got to the gate for boarding the plane had not been towed onto stand so we had to stand around for about 45 minutes before boarding started. Here though once started the boarding was much more organised and the First/Business passengers were boarded first with less of a scrum to get on board. The flight was very bumpy which meant we did not get as much sleep as we had hoped but we arrived on time even though we had departed late. Manchester airport immigration was empty at 6.20 am so we got through and collected our luggage in about 15 minutes. Apart from the chaotic boarding at Narita and the poor lounge we would certainly choose to fly CX again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-11;Flew JFK to Hong Kong round trip on B777. Avoid economy class. Seats are very uncomfortable. There is simply not enough leg room in economy and this is made first by reclining seat crushing one's knees. I had to stand up in the back gallery for almost 8 hours out of the almost 16 hours to bear the flight. Drinks mainly consisted of warm water. Lucked out on the way back and had a whole row of sits to stretch out on.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-11;5th Jan CX256 15 Jan CX110 and CX161. What a disappointment all the flights were. Heathrow/Sydney/Hong Kong/Heathrow. The most uncomfortable flight I have been on facilities virtually non-existent I am diabetic and when I asked for a biscuit was told I should have taken my own food the staff continually imposed their routines upon passengers lights out windows shut. The toilets smelt very bad at the end of the flight. The food was very poor and when one of my friends asked for a bread roll they claimed that they did not have any and what they did have were for the breakfast. One of our party cannot walk and is wheelchair bound at one point she had to wait 20 minutes for someone to respond to her request to be wheeled to the toilet. Two of us followed to assist and then had to stand in front of the toilet door for her privacy there was a complete lack of space - I would add that she is tall and very slim so size was not an issue. Very disappointing and far from being the best airline.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-06;MNL-HKG. Economy. CX918. Seat-39K. January 30. I really enjoyed flying with them. The service of the staff was attentive and friendly! The aircraft was clean the food was OK. I highly recommended flying with them and for my trip to Asia I will only use Cathay Pacific.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-02-06;I flew from LHR to HKG and HKG to Cebu on 20/12/2014. I have made CX my preferred airlines as they always make a fuss of me. Check in was fast and efficient lounge at London was comfortable and quite. I was very well looked after on both segments of my flights. Food excellent and service very good. January from Cebu to HKG and HKG to LHR I had a dreadful cough and not at all well and was not able to sleep well however the flight attendant really looked after me making sure I had hot drinks.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-30;MEL-MNL-MEL via HKG A330-300 aircraft very good service on both leg all on time flight attendants attentive food was ok the inflight entertainment is superb would definitely recommend them and fly them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-28;I flew from HKG-LAX on 01/27/2015. I had flown CX before and was looking forward to the experience. The First Class Lounge was as usual excellent. I had a light breakfast in the dining room so as not to spoil my appetite for the meals on board. The 777-300ER was updated with the new First Suite fabric and seat/lighting controls. The Flight Service manager was wonderful as were the other two Flight Attendants in the cabin. As it was my birthday the crew surprised me prior to landing with a birthday card. The food was as expected - stellar and love the caviar course. Studio CX consistently delivers with plenty of entertainment and the bed is a favorite part of the experience with actual turndown service and so comfortable. The wardrobe/closet is a welcome touch to store shoes hang clothing and more. I have seen others post a comment that I truly agree with - I didn't want this flight to end as it is such a positive comfortable experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-26;Travelled from Hong Kong to Sydney business class on 29 November 2014. Nothing negative to say at all. Beds particularly great food and entertainment very good. The staff were excellent. Having just flown Swiss Air from Zurich any airline would be better but I would now always try to fly Cathay Pacific Airlines.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-23;CX111 19/1/2015. Wonderful service superb food and an extremely comfortable seat. I am 202cm and I still had room to move with the seat in the lie flat position. Slept for 5 hours on a trip from Hong Kong to Sydney. Arrived refreshed and relaxed.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-23;HKG-LHR. 1st Class. Dined in the Wing 1st class lounge at Hong Kong airport and had a couple of cocktails. New lounge was lovely. Krug champagne and caviar after take off! The menu was superb and I enjoyed my lobster. The seating was great as was the TV monitor. Slept for 6 hours and enjoyed a good English breakfast. All in all I was delighted. (Used points and although I used most of them it was worth it).;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-23;Flew back today from Vietnam. The internal flight had great seats really comfortable with good leg room. But the flight from Hong Kong back to Heathrow was awful seats very uncomfortable. Toilet facilities not good needed to be serviced properly the occasional spray from staff didn't help. TV had out of date programs and rubbish movies. Would I travel long haul again with Cathay Pacific - no.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-21;Flew AKL-HKG-LHR. We received priority boarding as a premium economy passenger which gave us time to settle in to our seat. The seat pitch is 38 inches which is the same as BA and Virgin with plenty of room. There were headrests and footrests which made the trip comfortable as well as an amenity kit. The food was amazing probably because it came straight out of business class. Overall the trip was better value for money than Air New Zealand Spaceseat although the entertainment wasn't up to date. I would recommend them.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;My return trip from JFK to Bangkok via Hong Kong was one of the best flying experiences I have had. The new flat bed seats are comfortable to sit in and to lie down in and easy to function the choice of wines is limited but top drawer and the flight crew on all four sectors were neither slack or over the top. On these long flights it is always important to arrive at both ends in a relaxed frame of mind and I really think that Cathay have got their business class in great order and I will be using them whenever I can.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;London Heathrow UK - Hong Kong. CX256. Through London (Helsinki to Hong Kong) with my wife and two baby girls last month. Very good experience. Every thing fantastic.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;9 Dec returning on 12 Jan. Flights CX358 and CX901 outbound and CX934 and CX357 on return journey. Myself and a friend decided to fly with Cathay given then good reviews we have read but unfortunately we were not impressed by the level of service we received. We flew return from Manchester to Hong Kong which is about 12-13 hours duration. Our outward journey was the better of the two legs no delay and the service was okay. I asked for a chicken dinner which was then forgotten and then I was given the only available option which I couldn't eat. On the journey back me and my friend were separated by 9 rows and both given a middle seat. After being sent to three different Cathay staff they were unable to change our seats. To top it all off the flight home was delayed. The quality of service doesn't warrant the premium you pay for travelling with Cathay other airlines are a better bet in my opinion.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;Traveled business class between Bangkok and Colombo twice in last month principally because it is the cheaper than Thai or MAS. Terrible departure times 23.05 from Bangkok and even worse 02.25 from Colombo. Cathay now flies A330 instead of Boeing 777 which I think was better. Seat in capsule format very uncomfortable with recline minimal. In fully reclined position can't fully extend your legs. Three hour flight was just about tolerable. I wouldn't go for anything longer. Service on board is in a hurry to get things over as quickly as possible. Wine bought to you seat in a glass rather than bottle. Not impressed: Meals pretty mediocre. Cathay used to be amongst the best but all these airlines are being eclipsed by the Middle East carriers.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;Travelled SYD-HKG-CDG-HKG-SYD. SYD-HKG operated by A333 all other flights operated by 77W. Seat comfort was very good even for such a long flight with adequate back support and leg room.I found it relatively easy to sleep on Cathay. Food was of a very high quality for an airline - especially the Asian food options. The IFE system Studio CX kept me entertained for the entirety of my flights. The highlight was when I was flying from HKG-SYD and was stuck in a row of crying toddlers. The flight attendant came and asked whether I would like to move seat without me even asking. I was moved to a free exit row seat. It's the kind of service that you would not get out of the vast majority of competitors.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-19;Return economy trip SYD-HKG-Frankfurt and back. Departure 8th Dec on CX100 then CX289 with short transfer layover at HKG. Return trip on 12th Jan with 14 hr layover HKG. All legs almost 100% capacity. Very satisfied with the service provided by this carrier overall. I would rate satisfaction level of Cathay at the top of recent travel experience - slightly above V Australia (who are also very good). Aircraft mix of Airbus and Boeing in very good to excellent condition. Inflight entertainment almost as good as Emirates (no complaints) flight crew including pilots excellent level of attention throughout flight very good. Amenities cleanliness well maintained. Meals were about on par with most carriers - satisfactory but not outstanding. Preferred the configuration of the Boeing 777 - 3x3x3 to the A330 2x4x2. Ground experience at all airports excellent and efficient. Seating - special mention - the seats offer quite reasonable legroom and recline in economy. However found the seat base to be too thin resulting in discomfort after a few hours. Would be appreciated if this could be improved - otherwise satisfactory. Found seating comfort similar to V Aust who also operate 777 configuration and probably best long haul economy seat experienced. Inflight issue with entertainment unit rectified by cabin crew. Additional security measures at HKG resulted in minor delay to scheduled departure - additional safety measures/precautions - no complaints or issue. Suggest Cathay consider - the provision of basic passenger pack - toothbrush/paste/earplugs/eye shades - increase to luggage allowance. Excellent value for money with this trip in comparison to other similar carriers - delivered with a higher level of customer satisfaction. Would use and recommend again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-14;"Have been flying this airline almost on an annual basis in economy from LHR via HKG to MNL over the last seven years and have seen it deteriorate. The new economy seats might be an improvement over the old clam shell seats but leg space is minimal and being 6'2"" I have major problems without the passenger in front even reclining. I find it quite odd that the regionally configured older 777s and 747s offer substantially more legspace than the newer aircraft used on the London route. The cabins are kept at a freezing temperature as standard and there is no respite for my feet as they no longer provide socks. Meals are pretty poor and they don't serve water from a bottle but use tap water that tastes bleachy. CX really appears to have given up on the HKG to MNL route and offer a service akin to a budget airline. Very chaotic boarding dismal catering and no full drinks service are offered on this route.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-14;Flew from Melbourne to London Heathrow on 7 Jan 15. Cathay experience was very good indeed. On the leg Melbourne to Hong Kong was in Premium Economy and this was well worth the extra cost. The leg room was very good as was the food and the cabin staff. From Hong Kong to London Heathrow was upgraded to Business Class and all I can say is wow. The level of comfort and food was excellent the cabin crew could not do more for you. I know who I will be booking again when I need to make the journey - well done and thank you Cathay Pacific.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-11;HGK-MNL Business class 23D Cathay Pacific - everything was perfect. The staff were really friendly polite and professional. Everything were really clean the food was nice excellent entertainment services. I highly recommended flying with Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-11;LHR-HKG-BNE in Business Class. Cathay Pacific never fail to impress in many aspects of their Business Class product - from check-in to luggage collection it is an excellent product. Heathrow lounge continues to underwhelm and not up to quality of their HKG equivalents however the food and beverage selection were good. LHR-HKG on a spacious 773 and managed to secure the best seat in Business House (11A) which is situated in the first row of the mini-cabin behind First - meaning that I was wined dined and cleared in good time. Lunch starter desert and wines were superb but 'Signature' main course was disappointing service approached 9/10. I prefer the smaller and quieter Cabin lounge at Hong Kong and grabbed a shower and some tasty dim sum prior to the next leg. HKG-BNE flight was simply excellent on the A333. Despite the seat feeling a tad less spacious than on the 773 I managed 5 solid hours of sleep and was treated like royalty by the crew. I was referred to by name at every touch-point and the team provided an excellent dining experience that balanced efficiency anticipation and warmth in equal measure. My only minor gripe was that the main course was served cold however it was swiftly dealt with by the Purser who apologised profusely for the oversight. Cathay Pacific really do value your custom and it is little coincidence that they remain as 'one of the very best in the Business'.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-11;BAH-HKG-MNL. Once again I am very happy and satisfied with every aspect. Friendly cabin crew wide selection of inflight entertainment delicious food and good comfort of the economy class seats. Great job and great service as always! The packaging of their breakfast menu for our HKG-MNL flight was very interesting.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-05;I flew with Cathay Pacific economy class from Amsterdam to Hong Kong and vice versa. It was (at a supplement) possible to reserve a seat next to the emergency exit. This gave me an enormous amount of space for my legs - very comfortable. However it was freezing! Blankets and pillows were of no use at all at this temperature. Other than that - nice aircraft lovely and very diligent flight attendants good attention to cleaning toilets. I liked flying with Cathay Pacific (and Dragonair to/from Cambodia) very much and certainly would do it again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-05;"HKG-MNL Firstly CX's entertainment was so-so so are the staff but the food was an understatement. You are just served with drinks and a sandwich which is so stingy of CX unlike PAL which still offers meals onboard. I didn't like the seat because when you recline it it invades your legroom since it was a ""Glide Seat"". Although it was an ok flight I still prefer their competitors Cebu and PAL. Its a shame that CX offers this product.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2015-01-05;Travelling from Singapore to New York. Both legs (SIN to HKG HKG to JFK) of the flight were perfect. Meals were better than many other airlines and they served good dim sum! Staff were attentive and friendly. I read some reviews complaining that once meals are served and lights are off Cathy crew tend to chat at the rest area. I certainly didn't witness this. My only complain is the lounge at Changi and HKIA. The lounges were far too crowded I couldn't get a seat at The Wing I wished for a shower but I was told that it comes with a 30 minutes wait. I ended up at the public food court for some decent Hong Kong food. Though I managed to rest at G16 during the 3 hours transit. And take note priority boarding almost doesn't exist for Cathay in HKIA. There was an announcement but not exercised by the ground crew. So if you are those who like to board early join the queue early! I've got to say Singapore Airlines manage this much better than Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-31;I have had the opportunity to compare several carriers from SYD to FRA and DUS in Economy over the past few years and have just returned with CX from Europe for the first time. The words that come to mind are 'budget' and 'inconsistent service standards'. HKG to FRA return was a vastly different experience from SYD to HKG. On the way to Europe I reserved low fat meals and to say the food amounts were tiny (I am not big nor am I a huge fan of stuffing myself on planes) and certain elements of the meal service were non-existent compared to the regular fare would be an understatement. It was so mediocre that I decided to get the normal food offerings on the way back. One of the meal offerings from HKG to SYD which was a Beef Consume and can only be described as pieces of beef thrown into a clear flavourless broth with white rice was inedible. I am not the fussy however some things I noticed is that there were no hot towels only in premium economy CX are one of the few airlines who only allow 20kgs of checked baggage whereas all competitors TG/SQ/EK/BA allow more and the in season fruit salad consisted of about a handful of tiny pieces of Apple/Rock and Water Melon and soft drinks are poured out of bottles instead of receiving small cans. Apart from the fact that staff on the planes virtually never smile whilst serving passengers at least that was consistent. Furthermore 2 main meals were served within 3 hours of one another on a 9.5 hour flight back to Sydney. Why? When questioned I was told it was company policy. This resulted in not having any food for the last 5 hours to Sydney. Unlike SQ I also didn't notice on board staff helping or caring much about mothers with their young babies either. Now the good bits: Staff are very quick efficient and were always around throughout the flights with drinks and baskets of good snacks throughout FRA-HKG return not so much during SYD-HKG. Ice cream for dessert on two sectors was most welcome. The seats are very comfortable pitch is better than on paper leg room is very good each seat has a USB charger and the entertainment system is one of the easiest most enjoyable I have used although the movie /tv selection was not as vast as on some other carriers. Ground staff at all airports were also most helpful friendly and efficient. Had to unexpectedly break my trip in HKG and ground staff went out of their way to help me.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-31;A330 Business MEL-HKG. Once onboard I found Cathay Pacific business class absolutely faultless. The seat was comfortable and well designed the crew were attentive friendly and professional the catering was delicious and the entertainment was of good quality and fairly good choice. I can completely see why this product receives such rave reviews from most passengers. My only real complaint is the ridiculously limited baggage allowance. 30kg total is barely acceptable on economy class but for business is it a disgrace. When you compare it to 32kg x3 for other carriers it is not very competitive. Overall though this is an excellent product and well worth the premium.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-31;ORD-HKG return 18 Dec 2014 CX808. Fantastic airline. Great customer service both on the plane and off the plane. Left my wallet on the jet within 10 minutes of notifying ground personnel it was returned to me. Delicious meals with great quality plastic ware. Inflight entertainment had plenty of selection and the seats were comfy and spacious for a 15 hour trip. I only wish they had more alcohol selection.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-31;CX 701 & 702 (HKG-BKK-HKG). The flights were smooth the services were quite standard. nothing particular worth mentioning. However the food choices and the quality of food were subpar perhaps due to cost-cutting. Inflight entertainment was malfunctioned on return flight. Cathay's economy class looks increasing like a budget airline. Anyway overall it was acceptable for a short flight but nothing was particularly impressive.;POSITIVE

I've always had to dispose of my food tray because of abandonment and the extra seat pitch is just offsetted when the seat in front reclines - impossible to use laptop. Want to give thanks to the ""real"" PE reviews here I'm saved from the 16 hours of agony and cost.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-29;I flew economy from Brisbane to London via Hong Kong. The first leg Brisbane to Hong Kong was very busy and I took the view that the cabin crew were very pressed. Hence they made mistakes. For example I asked for red wine and got white wine despite the stewardess repeating my order to me. Water was served from plastic jugs and tasted of cleaning fluid. Clearly they had not been rinsed properly. And unlike most other airlines on such long haul routes there was no overnight pack (containing eg. toothpaste and toothbrush etc). I believe cost cutting has gone too far with Cathay.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-22;"FRA-HKG-PVG return in October. Although Cathay's fares are rather expensive I choose this airline because of the stopover opportunity at Hong Kong and the perfect departure times. Most flights to Europe leave at midnight so you can spend the whole day in HKG. Long haul flights very good with great staff. Although FAs are a bit reserved in general they are very attentive polite and caring about passengers. Several drinks were offered during the night and you can get free snacks in the galley. Toilets were kept clean. Quality of the meals very good but poor quantity. Why doesn't CX offer salt and pepper anymore? Looks like a rather silly cost cutting. A very positive aspect is that seating is not too cramped there are ""only"" 9 seats in a row in Economy Class instead of 10. Cathay's IFE is good with a wide selection of movies but most of them only in English a little down. Transfer at HKG is very easy but takes some time at security check (about 20 minutes). On flights to Shanghai hot meals and AVOD entertainment were offered which is outstanding for a flight time of 2 hours! Overall Cathay Pacific offers a good product but I would not rank it as a 5-star-airline in Economy Class.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-22;Flew Business class Doha - Hong Kong Round-trip. Both flights departed on time cabin crew were attentive and friendly. My Muslim meal request was honoured. However I opted for a window seat to look outside the cabin. Unfortunately it seems that CX has a policy of keeping window shades closed throughout the whole flight hence eliminating the purpose of window seat and the enjoyment of flying. I do not recommend flying with this airline if you enjoy window seat. I am a business class passenger and I expected to be treated with respect. Unfortunately this was not the case for me hence encouraging me to fly Emirates and Qatar Airways.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-18;Flew HKG-EWR. The business class was booked solid. The service was cursory at best. The dinner and breakfast (if you wanted to call it that) was an embarrassment to CX. The entire flight was terrible. If this is the best business class in the world I wonder what is the worst. You have my vote for being the worst.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-18;I flew from NYC to HKG. The Premium Economy section was practically empty yet staff were not attentive. Finished drinks were left for hours before being picked up. The most important failure was the seat. The seat is not comfortable. They are made for short people. The seat gave painful pressure mid thigh. On my return flight today I heard another female passenger complain about the same thing. Air New Zealand has a much better product for this class.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-18;Business Class LHR-HKG B777. HKG-AKL A340. I believe the people are the one who define an airline. You can have the most luxurious seats in town but it means nothing if there is no real service on board. This is why I regard Cathay Pacific as the best airline in the business (we flew with SQ EK as well). We flew in both newish business class in B777 and the old 'coffin' style A340 business class cabin. I can understand why people complain about the old one but I didn't have a problem with that. It's still comfortable. The service from the people on board was superb. We had a problem during the flight to Auckland. My phone fell into the space behind the seat. The FA chief asked me to move to the empty seat next to my seat as it would probably not safe due to risk of spark from the friction between the phone and the seat. She asked my partner's number so she would update us once the engineer retrieved the phone. At the end they managed to retrieve the phone and the lady sent us a text about it and also wished us a great holiday in NZ. I'd never thought that we would get such a great service from an airline. We currently live in Europe so we flew frequently with European airlines. I have to admit that we really have low expectation on airline service. We paid premium for the ticket but it was great value for the money. The service was amazing throughout the journey. I must say the food on board and in the lounges were fantastic. So would I recommend this airline? absolutely. It's not the cheapest but you will get what you paid for.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-10;Very efficient and welcoming boarding. The new business class seats are excellent. Plenty of space with storage for all the personal items and very comfortable in the sitting and sleeping positions. This was a long flight and both my wife and I slept most of the night. Food was good with excellent wines and service was immediate without being obtrusive. We had a 2 hour transfer in Hong Kong with no hassles. The second shorter fight on an A330 with the same seating was also very good. Overall a very pleasant journey with no complaints.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-10;Recently had to make an emergency booking and the prices were very high no business class seats were available so flew on Premium Economy. Check in was very fast and efficient at Heathrow and being a Marco Polo member was able to access the lounges London and HK. Boarded very quickly and settle into my seat with no seats in front of me (I actually found it uncomfortable compare to having a seat in front). Champagne served before take off food was surprisingly good and as usual Cathay pacific stewardess were excellent. At HK I flew business class to Cebu. Check in at Cebu fast and efficient and onto HK in premium class never did like the lounge in Cebu lack of decent food. Quite surprise no champagne was offered perhaps it because it is regional flight. Food wasn't that appetising so didn't bother. Premium class from HK to London champagne and soon settle into my seat this time half way with seat in front and this time I had a superb air steward he really did look after me I wasn't feeling too good – many thanks for that. OK Good point about premium class it is worth it if you can book in advance as the prices are much more reasonable excellent cabin crews quieter cabin and great food on long haul flights. The bad point about premium class I don't think you get welcome champagne on regional flights and the food isn't good except on long haul flights divider curtains remain open for an hour before takeoff and landing and I didn't like the fact that economy class passengers were using our rest rooms facility. Plastic cups for soft drinks or wine is a big no for me it should have been in a glass.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-04;I flew SYD-HKG-LHR in business class. I chose this airline because of the reviews and the full flat bed seats and I wasn't disappointed. I was concerned that the seat wouldn't be very comfortable when it converted into a bed but I slept surprisingly well. The flight crew in my cabin were attentive courteous and professional. I was always addressed by name and nothing was too much trouble for them. I arrived into London feeling rested and refreshed. The only criticisms (and they are minor) were the meals on the SYD-HKG leg which were only average (the food on the HKG-LHR leg was superb) and the in-flight entertainment which was a bit limited. I had plenty of other things to occupy me though so this wasn't much of a problem. I can't recommend this airline highly enough.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-04;"LHR to Hong Kong and then onto Australia. The flight from LHR to Hong Kong was one of the worst I have experienced. During the flight it was very cold and several people were sitting with top coats on. I asked a flight attendant if the heating was working and the reply was ""it will warm up once we get going"". After 6 hours it was still freezing. It took ages for the food to be served and there seemed to be a lack of staff. If like me your over 6ft the seating is very tight. On our return from Australia there was no change. Sitting at the back it was a case of take it or go hungry as the food on the menu had run out. It was still cold and the paper thin blankets given out were a waste of time. I was told this was a good company to fly with I can confirm its one of the worst!";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-04;LHR-HKG-SYD and return. Business Class at a good fare thanks to a recent sale. Used Cathay Pacific earlier in the year to get to Bali and having been somewhat underwhelmed I managed my expectations accordingly for this very long journey. All I can say is my expectations didn't need to be managed! Of the four flights one was 'outstanding' (SYD-HKG) two were 'very good' (LHR-HKG and HKG-LHR) and one was 'no worse than BA' (my benchmark for lacklustre Business Class service) (HKG-SYD). New clean planes on all sectors. On-demand entertainment with a wide choice. Flat beds. Very good to excellent food with the exception of the breakfast on the HKG-SYD leg which was very poor indeed. Lovely wines. And on time or very close to it. But it's the cabin crew who really make (or break) the flight and Cathay Pacific crew are in my view generally the best out there. Attentive but not pushy. Service with a smile. And apparently happy - at least in front of the paying customers. If you go where I need to go you're my airline of choice now.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-01;Flew from Bangkok to Hong Kong on CX2700. The departure and arrival were on time. We were upgraded to premium economy since I was not able to do the advance check in and had to call CX office in Bangkok. Overall flight and meal are OK.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-12-01;Flew from Hong Kong back to Bangkok. The plane was pushed off on time but we sat on the tarmac for almost half a hour without any explanation from the cockpit. Once in the air everything was acceptable.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-25;I flew from LHR-HKG on CX256. The flight was full and the staff were kept busy. The cabin service was adequate but not anything special would fly with them again but not if I could get a cheaper fare elsewhere.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-25;My partner and I flew premium economy in October 2014 from London to Perth. The leg from London to Hong Kong was ok with very attentive cabin crew. We were both very disappointed with the seat and limited space in premium economy. We found the food and beverage service very similar to economy class. The leg from Hong Kong to Perth was very disappointing as my inflight entertainment system was unavailable due to the TV screen being jammed. This was made worse as it had not been fixed for several days and the cabin crew were aware of it. I was given $75 American dollars to spend on boards as compensation. On my return to Perth I made a complaint to the airline regarding my experience. The airline did reply apologising for the unavailability of the inflight entertainment system. I was offered another $75 American to spend onboard my next Cathay Pacific flight. I was not happy with the response from Cathay and as a result will not choose to fly with them again. My partner and I were very disappointed with Premium Economy and did not feel it was worth the extra money really not much better than economy class.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-20;We flew economy Brisbane to Paris Via London and Hong Kong which although had 2 stops was faster than 1 stop and the departure and arrival time was suited - able to leave at night after work and arrive at night tired. We had great service and were ready to sing Cathay praises. This flight was great the meals movies etc. We chose Cathay as it had good prices and times for an open jaw flight bookable directly on their site (I prefer not to use Travel agents). Return was NYC to HK and HK to BNE. The meals were terrible. For a 14 hour trip and we were served 2 terrible meals (the first in many flights that I have ever really thought - yuk) and just couldn't eat including vegetables and pasta SO overcooked. (miss being able to pre-order seafood meals and no healthy options unless you want a fruit plate served at every meal for 60+ hours - really?). We were lucky that we got on with food and coffee from the airport lounge (as they take some time to serve - unlike Singapore) and the passenger next to us told us how grumpy he was due to hunger - after his 2 meals! When we buzzed cabin service on the return trip it was served with a grimace and we were made feel uncomfortable. It is very different from the excellent professional and immediate service that Singapore Airlines provides in economy.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-20;"CX888 HKG to YVR. The HKG flight to JFK via YVR leaves at 1 am. So if you are on holiday and even if you leave your baggage at the hotel for the day it makes for a very long stay at the airport. The lounges are excellent (the Wing is very good the Bridge is excellent the Pier very dated-try to find e.g. a USB port) unlike American business lounges they have hot food some to order champagne and several staff cleaning and tidying the lounges. Our flight was delayed. The excuse was ""late towing."" I've never heard that excuse. Apparently the plane was there all along but ground staff had neglected to tow it to the gate. When it finally showed up they promised us a 1.50 a.m. departure. At 2.20 we were still on the tarmac. On the plus side the cabin crew were excellent they whipped into action once we were airborne and for those of us still wanting to eat they provided a great meal in no time. Drink service was a little tight. if you asked you got it and they were generous with pours but there was no e.g. pre-flight drink orders or refills without asking. The newish biz class seats are very comfortable and I really liked the storage areas. Their night masks have velcro. Sounds petty but a comfortable night mask really helps you sleep on a long haul. Their large AV screens offer a great range of movies and TV shows. The second meal was decent but no alcohol on offer (even though you arrive at YVR at 8:30 p.m. if on time). I would fly Cathay again in a heartbeat and think their air crew did a standout job but there is still room for some polish on service.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-20;"NRT to HKG. Even though this is an international flight Cathay uses their ""regional"" 777 craft with the 2x3x2 config in business. My partner and I had the middle three the middle seat empty which is common on e.g. Lufthansa within Europe. Service was excellent. Food was very good. Flight was on time pleasant no issues. The NRT business lounge is nothing to write home about very basic needs an update. The regional biz seats do not fully recline. In fact if you're six feet (or taller) you will find in the recline position they are actually a little uncomfortable. I found it impossible to doze off even though with the early departure I was tired and ready for a snooze as you're lying in a sort of zig-zag pattern. Still the cabin seemed brand spanking new everything was in perfect order and there was much more leg room than a regional biz class flight in the US or Europe. Cabin crew offered prompter more attentive service than on our long haul a few days later. For a flight of less than five hours faultless.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-17;Flew Cathay to New York via Hong Kong in business economy. Was nervous at downgrading after reading all the comments. Could not have been more pleasantly surprised. Food excellent cabin staff most courteous and friendly seat comfortable all good from me. Inflight entertainment excellent. Going to fly again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-11;Travelled business from Paris to Brisbane with Cathay Pacific via Hong Kong. The flight from Paris to Hong Kong was very poor. Business was full and staff didn't seem very friendly. They ran out of meal options and they couldn't find anything for me to eat for the main meal - very bad. The seat was comfortable and spacious enough but the service was like being in economy - cattle class with a bigger seat. I rang the buzzer but no ever came. The flight from Hong Kong to Brisbane was marginally better crew did seem more attentive but food was average booked these flights with FF points would have been absolutely livid if I had paid for the flights.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-11;ORD-HKG Oct 10. First Class on Cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. Consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. For example they seem to offer some F passengers an escort through security while others (like me) do not get one. They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrong… the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume? But it is a HUGE premium and from my limited experience the Business Class is a better value assuming you can get accustomed to the Cathay service. They are really very friendly but they basically ignore you.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-06;CX903 MNL-HKG and CX904 HKG-MNL. Main gripe is they don't serve proper hot meals. Not even coffee. Even Philippine Airlines serves hot meals on the way to HKG. Early morning flight outbound. Online check in meant shorter queue and a chance for breakfast in the airport (which is essential since CX starves its passengers on this leg). I think breakfast should at least have been served. Seats on the older 777-200 was wide and comfortable but IFE non existent. Flight crew attentive and friendly. Mid-afternoon return flight on 777-200 with new configuration. More IFE options but food service basically non existent. Not even ice for the water was provided! My wife's monitor conked out 30 minutes after StudioCX was turned on and couldn't be addressed by the apologetic staff. I think CX should improve its regional service. Unless your tickets are on discounted economy (as mine was) you'd feel cheated flying CX MNL-HKG-MNL.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-06;Flew EWR-HKG in October2014. The lounge was shared with BA. No proper catering instead chips and semi-lousy sandwiches as well as beer and soft drinks. The flight itself was a hurried affair as everyone wanted to sleep. The FAs seemed angry and couldn't wait to deplane. They didn't crack a smile and didn't want to be bothered with questions. The EWR catering was awful. The food service (dinner and breakfast) was for the most par inedible.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-06;Flew Business class from SYD to JFK via HKG on Qantas points - a long trip but easy HKG connection and comfortable seating on both sectors particularly with the new 1-2-1 configuration. Service was pleasant and efficient and good food quality although limited IFE options detracted from overall experience. Very pleased to avoid LAX even if a few hours longer and evening HKG departure made for a restful evening sleep. Great way to get to North America from Australia.;POSITIVE

Traveled from Auckland to London return from Milan to Auckland all flights in October - premium economy. Seating disappointing foot rest hopeless. Food strictly average as was service on all sectors. Inflight entertainment also strictly average - films not current. Cathay needs to up its act in premium economy if it is to compete.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-03;HKG-ORD on B777 in Business. Despite a 90 minute delay a wonderful flight. Peaceful cabin environment comfortable seat excellent IFE good food and crisp professional attentive service. Hard to find many faults other than a somewhat sub-standard wine list.

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-11-03;LHR-HKG-LHR. Service orientated with smiles in abundance. Food refreshments and snacks where all good quality. I felt looked after and arrived at both destinations on time. Fantastic airline others can learn a lot from Cathay Pacific.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-31;My wife and I travelled from Sydney to Hong Kong on 3 October 2014 in Premium Economy. Cathay Pacific had not cleaned its on-board toilets prior to leaving Sydney. Shortly after take off we used two separate toilets on the plane. Both toilets were filthy both had urine all over the floors and smelt. Our second leg of our trip from Hong Kong to Paris with Cathay Pacific had a delayed departure of about 1 1/4 hours. Finally we discovered why there had been a delay. Cathay Pacific announced that the entertainment system on the plane was not working or more correctly that there was no power to the entertainment system. Hence in Premium Economy we spent 12 hrs on a plane with no entertainment system no reading light and an inoperative flight attendant call button due to no power. The responsiveness of the flight attendants remained minimalist despite the inability of passengers to call attendants. Overall Cathay Pacific's service and value we received for the money we had paid was very poor. From what I observed in October 2014 the standard at Cathay Pacific airlines has dramatically fallen.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-31;Travelling from Melbourne to Beijing and transfer in HKG (CX178 and CX390). The seats are fine and studio CX is good. It has some new movies TV dramas and music. Especially it has the entire season of TV series. Other airlines only have several episodes. MEL-HKG had supper and breakfast the food was delicious. Three choices for the main course: fish fillet beef sirloin with rice and vegetarian penne. Breakfast had two options they are seafood congee and frittata with bacon. Choices ran out as I was in the rear row so I can only choose frittata. But the cabin crew keep apologised many times they were very good.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-31;"We flew from Hong Kong to London Heathrow on 23 October. The flight left 35 minutes late. The first problem was that Cathay Pacific had not registered my vegetarian meal and were in the process of allocating this to a surprised passenger nearby (who was willing to accept it). When we let them know that it was me that had ordered the vegetarian option the crew said that It ""shouldn't be a problem - there was probably a spare vegetarian meal aboard"". Not what you want to hear at the start of a 13 hour flight. For the record the other partners on the flights involved (Virgin Atlantic and Air New Zealand) had registered my request and made it clear within minutes of our arrival onboard that they knew where to deliver the vegetarian meal. We saw the cabin crew for the two meals and on three occasions after - the other aisle was serviced our aisle had little assistance. I was awake for about two thirds of the flight so I didn't miss them while I was asleep. We had to almost grab a steward to hand over our rubbish. This was not Premium Economy this was cattle class with extra legroom. Never again. Next time we fly we will avoid Cathay Pacific.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-31;I first flew Cathay in 2011 to China which was a very good experience in all areas (service catering entertainment etc) however I flew Cathay again in 2014 to USA and Canada and was very shocked at how the quality of their service catering and entertainment had declined in a matter of 3 years. The staff who were previously helpful are now unfriendly lazy and unhelpful and the catering is atrocious. The food is poor quality and has little or no taste and rightly said by another reviewer they somehow no longer provide salt and pepper! I understand times are tough with certain airlines but you wouldn't expect them to skim on basic condiments. The entertainment system has limited options and sadly I think the overall passenger experience in economy has gone downhill. Don't think Cathay will be my first choice in future.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-28;"Recently flew from Calcutta via Hong Kong to Chicago. Calcutta-Hong Kong section operated by Dragonair. Good service friendly attendants. Interestingly enough I was served a full meal while the others in the cabin received a wrapped sandwich. Eating and drinking ""sumptuously"" while surrounded by passengers sipping cola and chewing on a morsel made me self-conscious and slightly uncomfortable. A flight attendant informed me that the others had been upgraded and had not paid the fare that I had and was thus not deserving of the full meal and drinks and convenience pack normally provided in this cabin! The Hong Kong-Chicago flight was efficient as always though it seemed the standards among the flight attendants were not uniformly high. Overall Cathay Pacific delivers a high quality travel experience.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-28;YVR-HKG-MEL in Premium economy. On balance a bit of a mixed bag experience. Seats definitely an uptick from economy but the fundamental problem is cabin design which is flawed - the cabin feels like a retrofitted afterthought which it is. On the B777 YVR-HKG leg the one toilet in premium economy is in the right front of the cabin necessitating anyone on the left side of the plane to crawl across the four seats in the middle front row to access it. That isn't well thought out and isn't a nice thing to do to the people sitting there and is difficult at night with all four people stretched out sleeping so the alternative is walking back into economy down the left aisle which is a hassle. On the A330 HKG-MEL there is no premium economy toilet which requires a trip back to economy. Food seemed more 'economy' than 'business' but to be expected really. The other big negative on the YVR-HKG flight was the premium economy cabin was filled with upgraded passengers due to a massively oversold economy cabin. I would estimate 80% of the people in premium economy were upgraded and not for status reasons which makes the logic behind paying for it hard to justify. On the positive side Cathay service always shines and the crews are professional and efficient.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-28;MEL-HKG-YYZ return in economy. It was okay let's face it economy is never going to be fantastic but for economy it was just fine and I would do it again. As we were going to Canada we were allowed 23kg x 2 which is great. I considered upgrading to Premium Economy but it would have been an EXTRA $4000 for the two of us just too much. The flight to and from HKG from Mel was fine. Seat a little hard but we found sitting on their blanket in its bag helped there. The food was okay. The FA's were lovely very friendly. Entertainment very good also. Flight to Toronto was full. We paid extra for exit row seats. Was very cold against the door. I had wrapped just about everything I could around my legs it was really freezing there but still not a bad seat in that you could just walk straight out of it no climbing over anyone so if you go for that seat bring warm items for your legs. Going to YYZ was better than returning. Returning the staff seemed to disappear. They were not very organised at YYZ coming back either the line ups were all messed up and wheelchairs couldn't get through. They called the far rows first before business and it was just a big crazy mess of confused people. We were late leaving HKG for MEL due to late passengers but not surprising as there was a gate change. Mostly though the flights were on time our luggage arrived safely the entertainment was good and thank goodness there were no shell seats as what we experienced back in March. After travelling to Canada before via LA this is a far better option even if longer. Stopping over in HKG is ideal and the airport there is very efficient.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-28;DEL-HKG-SFO in Premium economy class. Few of the points to be highlighted are: Reliable co-operative ground staff and very co-operative onboard staff. Highly graded on punctuality. Easy booking even on phone. Easy online check in and pre-allotted seats. Good and tasty onboard food service. Comfortable seats even in economy class premium economy class is not as comfortable as advertised by air line but OK for the money charged.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-28;We travelled from Hong Kong to LA on the 17/10/2014 on flight CX880 we usually fly business but on this occasion we flew premium economy we have flown for many years using Cathay to Australia Europe and the Middle East so were expecting a good flight not long after dinner the staff closed all the window shades obviously wanting people to sleep so they did not have to work as was indicated by the total lack of any service they passed through the cabin about twice in 6 hours offering people warm water from a bottle where was the ice cold drink or tea or coffee? I have never ever experienced such poor service in all my years of flying the staff on this flight had no recollection of customer service or relations to earn the 2014 airline of the year baffles me. we will certainly not be using Cathay on future flights the aviation world is full of options.;NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-13;Traveling with Cathay Pacific in premium economy class from Doha to Hong Kong in 28 August 2014. Flight was on time and was operated on a A330-300. Welcome drinks and hot towel was served when I got on the plane. Touch screen entertainment system was sensitive and films were up to date. Dinner was served 1.5 hours later and it was good. However breakfast wasn't good - just a snack box served with a very cold chicken wrap - Qatar Airways serves a hot meal on the same route in economy class. Crew should smile more. Seat was uncomfortable and after a eight hours flight I was very painful. The toilet was dirty. Flight arrived Hong Kong on time. I won't pay about a double price than economy class next time when I travel in Cathay's premium economy class.;POSITIVE

HKG-EWR a disaster again after simple dinner served (tiny rice or pasta with tiny salad nothing else) no real food (except chips) could be provided until the breakfast (very funny arrangement as we landed EWR at 21.00pm New York time after almost 16hrs flight). Return flight ORD- HKG was the same for such one of the world's longest flight CX really doesn't care about passengers in the economy cabin.

What followed was the most frustrating of experiences. 10 hours in HK then we were forced to fly via Tokyo to LHR. Delay of another 7 hours in Tokyo. Arrived LHR feeling dreadful. No compensation whatsoever was offered to us until our daughter complained and we were offered a $100 voucher each which we still have not received and we are now back in Adelaide. Then came the return flight last week. Plane out of LHR delayed two hours. Turned up at airport with bags packed (as we had been told to do whilst still at home) only to be advised that they could not get us on a flight out of HK for 48 hours. Back home and unpacked bags.

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-05;Probably the best of the legacy carriers. Had a trip DCA-HKG-LHR in economy and there was little to fault from price food seats and service. I do prefer from the more generic Gulf carriers. The service is more focused and tried to deliver a Hong Kong/UK/Europe product instead of a false generic international feel.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-05;Flight 293 from Hong Kong to Rome on an A340-300 seat 16A. As it was a late night flight was told that my meal would be available when requested. When I asked they said they were unable to serve reheated food but would serve me their bowl of snack noodles which was just that. The AVOD was not functioning on arrival and continued to be out of order for the 11 hour flight. A most apologetic flight manager offered me some inflight shopping vouchers. Not very happy about the whole experience in an ageing craft despite full recline seats.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-05;Hong Kong-Tokyo Haneda-Hong Kong Outbound flight CX542 was excellent the flight attendants were very attentive even though the flight was busy. They carefully asked passengers' preference and when I was not sure which wine to order the flight attendant suggested me to try a little bit of each before making a decision. Very thoughtful indeed! I also enjoyed the conversation with them. The flight was slightly delayed but it didn't bother me too much. However the return flight CX549 was less impressive. The flight attendants were not as friendly and attentive as the outbound flight. They forgot and skipped my dessert. Anyway everything else was fine.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-05;"JFK-BKK return in F. Simply the best. Outbound via stopover in YVR on 773 seat was malfunctioning but staff were more than proactive in having engineering fix it the second we landed in Vancouver. Fantastic food drink and AVOD combined with immaculately professional service from FAs equals the absolute best way to fly commercially these days. Staff go above and beyond to ensure a 15+ hour flight feels as comfortable as possible. Lie-flat seat with comfy duvet and mattress pad mean I was able to get over 8 hours of solid sleep - a rare feat for my over 6-foot- tall frame. Flagship lounge ""The Wing"" in HKG very comfortable but could use some more food options. Otherwise impeccable. Will be flying CX on all future trips to Asia.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-01;I recently flew economy class from round-trip from the U.S. to Hong Kong on to Japan. I must report that the experience with Cathay Pacific was once again excellent. I enjoyed everything about the flight - the entertainment the flight crew the food and snacks. On this trip my bags were lost in the U.S. by American Airlines and did not make the transfer to Japan. However Cathay staff took responsibility provided me with compensation for my troubles and then delivered the bags the next day exactly when they said they would. I was extremely impressed with how they handled the situation (being very apologetic) to the professional manner in which they handled the situation. I would definitely fly with this airline again in the future!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-10-01;Great trip from Hong Kong to Heathrow but no vegetarian food although this was requested by our Tour Operator. The Steward kindly cooked a vegetarian meal for me so thank you for that. The food and drinks given were really good and entertainment was tremendous.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-28;"I took CX369 today from Pudong Shanghai airport. I was actually booked an earlier flight of KA891 which was cancelled due to typhoon ""Phoenix"" at 1830h I was being notified by CX via text message before 9am so at least I had enough time to rearrange another flight. It was all fixed before 10am - how efficient. When I arrived at the airport all flights were further delayed - ground staff gave me the option to change to another flight. Eventually the flight was 3.5 hours delayed and on landing in HGK it was only 2.5 hours delayed. Apart from that all announcements were clear as a Marco Polo member I was comfortably enjoying some private time in the CX lounge.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-28;SIN-HKG (A330-300) and HKG-SIN (B747-400). Very comfortable and reasonable services provided. Less interference by the staff and very prompt service. In-flight entertainment was adequate for the four hours flights. No qualms over the seats as there were adequate leg space for both flights except that it's not rolled back but protruding in front. Cathay Pacific certainly beat Singapore Airlines when it comes to value for money. But if you are talking about overall comfort and satisfaction I will still prefer SQ over to CX. However I will definitely fly with CX again if there is any good fares offered by them.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-28;Amsterdam to Melbourne via Hong Kong. First leg had the 1-2-1 seat configuration which is better for couples. Second leg had the 1-1-1 herringbone configuration. Really comfortable seat. Full flat and very comfortable sleep. Confident assured staff. Good quality business lounges - excellent showers in Hong Kong. Good food but not great. Good entertainment. Best carrier I've been with.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-22;Had high expectations. My main gripe is the inflight entertainment. It is controlled by them and you cannot watch anything until about 15 mins after departure and then they took our headphones and turned the screen off when there was still 15 mins to go before landing! No other airline does this that I have flown with. You can watch what you like until 20 mins after landing with British Airways for example and many others. I had 7 mins left of the movie so not impressed. Food portion was small and not particularly nice. Wine is poured by them into a cup so you don't get much. Offered only twice on long flight. Other airlines give you a small bottle each time. Seats uncomfortable No toothpaste or toothbrush offered. Coffee revolting. Won't fly again with CP if I can avoid it.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-22;Flew YVR-JFK on CX 888 in First and can't say enough about the quality of the product. I'm Qantas Platinum / One World Elite and fly CX whenever I have the opportunity. This flight was another example of what CX offers - unmatched comfort along with all necessary amenities and ultra professional service. The airline is firing on all cylinders and is the benchmark by which others should measure themselves. Cabin peaceful seats comfortable food delicious IFE superb and highly professional crew. Consistently the best product in the industry.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-19;LHR-HKG. Premium Economy cabin isolated from the mayhem of Economy and had its own toilet for PE passengers which was not crashed by Economy people. Service very good particularly the hostess who put my jacket away in a closet and remembered to return it to me as we stopped at the stand in HKG. Food a bit disappointing - the breakfast tasted poor and was sickly. Good choice of entertainment. Could not sleep in the seat though just not comfortable enough to relax sufficiently. On return journey cabin was partly empty which looked promising but the only benefit was faster service and no toilet queue. A man sat in front of me and reclined his seat fully for the whole 13 hours except meals which wrecked my journey. On a daytime East-West flight that is totally unacceptable and should not be permitted. I had to watch movies with the screen 30 cm from my face. It's the luck of the draw however and overall I would recommend the airline and cabin.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-19;HKG to LHR PEY class. Lounge busy but as good as ever. People arrive far too early for flights so it's always full. Flight boarding fast got front row seat. Food and AVOD great both ways. Impressed in general buzzed for a coffee on both flights lovely friendly attitude for coffee both times quickly designated bathroom in PEY. Highly recommended.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-18;Numerous flights with Cathay Pacific over the recent month or so almost all long-haul. Most recent was BNE-HKG- LHR-HKG-BNE. All flights packed but on-board service remained good. However even for an Emerald Frequent Flyer (and I fly Cathay so many times I've lost count) getting a window seat preference was not always possible. Also while the cabin crew always seemed to do their best the same cannot be said for their lounge counter staff especially in the Hong Kong (First Class) Lounge who only rarely seem ready or willing to assist with enquiries. On-board food good but wine portions poor these days.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-17;Flew HKG-MEL on an A330-300. Went on board with great expectations and was left wanting to be honest. First the good things dedicated check in and boarding which some of the other airlines that fly PE could learn from. The gluten free meal I was served was tasteless and the entertainment system I found was nowhere near as good as the BA one was. Service was sketchy at best couldn't recommend them.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-17;I've flown with Cathay a few times. Recently did SYD-HKG-LHR and return 9 days later (yesterday). I enjoyed my trip and was pleasantly surprised with the food this time more than any other. Seats are a bit comfier with Emirates but for the price being just slightly above the cheapest available I would choose Cathay if on a budget. If I had a bit more money I would prefer Emirates. Staff were very helpful and friendly.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-17;Hong Kong to Sydney Business Class. I haven't flown them in a few years but did last night and will certainly do so again. Seat movies touchscreen TV service meals customer attention is first class. I fly first class regularly but CP leaves even first class for dead.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-17;FRA to HKG return plus a PVG-HKG sector in between (in Ordinary Econ). All flights on 777-300ER. Each on time arrivals. Find the PE seats a definite notch up from the Econ ones as you would expect. The front row middle section is nice because of the extra legroom but I found the leg rest fiddly and not terribly comfortable. Also as others have noted the S/B side toilet means a lot of people have to clamber past you to use it which gets tiresome. Food and drink tasty and plentiful surprisingly for a HK based carrier the western option was better than the Chinese one ! There seems to be a running debate on here as to whether PE is worth the difference over Econ. I'd say it all depends on the extra fare demanded. In my case it was about 30% more which to my mind is worth paying. I've seen some instances where it's nearly double the Econ fare which I'd not feel justified in paying. Overall CX's is better vfm than the BA or Virgin product but still well behind that of Air New Zealand.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-09;Amsterdam to Bali with transit in Hong Kong. Did the same trip with SQ last year with transit in Singapore. I have to say that the SQ experience was much better. CX seats are awful for my back. SQ gave more attention and the service was not rushed. Cut backs are quite obvious with smaller food portions and only water during the night. The seafood congee breakfast had three small prawns and four slithers of mushrooms and that was it. Quite inadequate. The last few years I have flown many times to Hong Kong with Qantas BA and Qatar. CX do not stand out compared to other airlines. Will avoid CX in the future.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-06;"JFK-HKG. Was upgraded to Business Class at check-in without even asking. Almost 16hr flight seat extremely comfortable and roomy. Best airline food I've eaten and plenty of it. Entertainment system had 15"" screen and more movies and TV shows than I could have watched in 3 flights.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-06;Flight CX162 from Sydney to Hong Kong on August 31. Unfortunately the touch screen in front of me had some problems midway through the trip and turned blank. Asked a cabin attendant for help but nothing could be done except resetting the inflight entertainment system which meant everyone on board would have to stop watching their movies for 10 mins. I was left with nothing to do for the 2nd half of my journey which was a bit of a let down as others were enjoying their movies. We got served 2 meals during the flight but on both occasions I didn't get what I want because of limited supply.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-06;I paid $2500 for a return flight Toronto - Bangkok on 22nd August 2014. The flights were on time. The food was mediocre. The entertainment was good. My real beef is with my return flight. The leg from Vancouver to Toronto was carried out by Westjet. 1) They (CX) could not issue my Wesjet boarding pass. I had to go to Westjet counter in Vancouver airport to get the boarding pass. 2) Since it was a red eye flight there was no sandwich provided even though I agreed to pay. This was a 4.5 hrs flight 3) You have to purchase a headphone. Headphones were provided free of charge on all CX flights. CX dropped the ball when they switched their passengers to Westjet. I will never fly Cathay Pacific again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-09-01;CX829 and CX723 YYZ to HKG and onto KUL on 24 Aug. In contrast to the outgoing flight I must say I was more than satisfied with my return flight. Early morning departure from Toronto we were the last flight to leave. Full flight boarding was organized and efficient and the ground staff were pleasant and accommodating. I had an empty seat next to me which helped. The meals were disappointing in terms of size but were tasty. Snacks were provided on the 15 hour flight to HKG but you had to ask. Good quality shortbread cookies and hot cup noodles were provided. Staff were pleasant and the cabin manager was very sweet. As I had a cold she made me a cup of tea with honey and lemon and checked on me later to ask if I wanted another one! Seats were ok not great and in flight entertainment was adequate. No real complaints. All flights were on time toilets were clean so all in all a slick operation.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-28;I am a lifetime Gold Qantas member and just this week flew Sydney - Hong Kong Premium Economy with no issues flight food and service was great. Then boarded CX0364 to Shanghai flight was 30 minutes late boarding however then we waited in the plane for 3.5 hours before taking off (I watched 2 movies) the reason that there was 4 other flights ahead of us using the same route to Shanghai unbelievable. Then on the return flight to Hong Kong CX0369 arrived at the Pudong airport at 2.30pm for a 5.30pm flight to find all of the check in counters closed there was no real explanation for this but was told to check in at the standby counter. I did this and received a pass B16 it seems because I have gold status I was allocated to B the guy I was flying with being a silver was allocated C6 and the local guy a D as he has no status. In talking to other passengers we learnt that the 1.30 flight still had not left so it seems that the pass was a chance to get on an earlier flight. Now I could go on and on about this but the facts are that some of the Cathay staff were very rude and unprofessional in their handling of this matter we received no real info on what was going on except to ask us to come back at 4pm and then 6pm to check what was going on after returning at 5 mins to 6pm I heard my number B16 called so I was moved to the earlier flight which was supposed to depart at 7pm but finally left after 8pm then to rub salt into the wounds on arrival in HK we had to bus it to the terminal. I arrived at my hotel at 11.30pm but my boss arrived at 3.30am! I understand that flights are delayed from time to time however surely Cathay can train its staff to be polite and advise customers what is really going on.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-28;CX829 YYZ-HKG 24 Aug and connecting to CX723 to KUL. YYZ to HKG was a 15 hour flight in Premium Economy and was as perfect a flight as you could have wanted it to be! I was sick with a cold and the stewardess brought me a box of tissues and made me hot tea with lemon and honey. She enquired if I needed more and was quite attentive. When I told her I recognized her from my outbound flight on 4 Aug she was thrilled that I recognized her. Seats were spacious great leg room but I would have appreciated another 2 inches of recline to make sleeping that more comfortable. The downside was the food what was served was tasty but the portions were small and served on a tray not much larger than an A4 size piece of paper. The meal service was rushed and as it was a night flight there could have been more patrols with drinks and snacks. They need to improve on their snack quality which mainly consists of processed food. A few choices like fruit and sandwiches would have been nice. Would definitely fly with them again especially in PE.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-28;LHR-HKG. I normally fly CX whenever I go Asia. Flight to HK was delayed but was informed 10hrs before my flight and was given £15 food vouchers to spend when I checked in. Service was impeccable as always quick service when I request anything entertainment is plentiful and staff were attentive even remembering my name and seat! Return back to LHR was a fully booked flight so service was a little slower but that was fine by me. Staff always had a smile on their face even though they were very busy. Cabin and toilets very clean as per usual. Seats are comfy and extra pillows and blankets on request. Can't fault the service and it is definitely worth the money. Another happy customer of CX.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-26;LHR-HKG-SYD. First leg on a modern 777-300ER boarding slightly chaotic with most people not listening to the boarding calls. Onboard service was very good with food and drinks of good quality. AVOD was fast and responsive with a decent selections of movies etc. Second flight on a a330-300. Bulkhead seats so plenty of room to stretch legs out. Food and drinks again of decent quality. Would recommend this airline my only issue being the seats which are a bit on the hard side.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-26;Johannesburg to Ho Chi Minh City return via Hong Kong. 3/7/2014 - 19/7/2014. Flight was delayed and caused missing connecting flight. Delayed me by over 24 hours. Ground staff were rude and unhelpful. Customer service that I contacted when I eventually got home were not much better. Will never fly Cathy Pacific again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-18;LAX-HKG-BOM in Premium Economy. Seats are very comfortable. Food and drinks were good quality and sufficient. Crew were really good and responded quickly to requests. Definitely good value for money.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-18;Business Class ORD-HKG-ORD Seats 19A 19K. Could not get online boarding pass so had to go to the counter in Chicago. Unfortunately they only open a few hours before the flight leaves. So about 50 of us had to wait in line for over an hour before they open the counter. No choice can't even go to the bar to wait because you can't get into the terminal without a boarding pass. Poor selection of wine (hard to believe that the most popular wine in America - Chardonnay is not on flights to/from USA). Poorly stocked beverages every CPX flight I've been on has run out of various beers and soft drinks. Meal marginal. Overcooked beef. The service is bizarre. They are incredibly friendly and seem to be sincerely sorry as they apologize over and over throughout the flight for the various shortcomings. But having said that they are frustrating because they hide in the galley for most of the flight. Never come through the cabin. Seating on the plane is comfortable. Check-in at HKG is awful. They assume you are familiar with the process lounges etc. They offer no explanation or guidance. I fly the airline because the seats are comfortable and they have reasonable award levels for flights with Asia Miles/Marco Polo.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-18;Took CX919 and CX912 HKG-MNL-HKG on 11/15 August 2014 for business trip. Both flights were delayed and on the return leg I almost missed a ferry connection to Macau due to this. CX only offers light snack (a roll/puff/wrap) on flight with only water juice coffee or tea options. Considering it was less than two hours it is still acceptable though I have been on similar-length flights that served full meals (Air Macau MFM-TPE). Seats were unbelievably hard - I had aches upon arrival for both flights. Given the limited options between HKG and MNL guess this is already the best option.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-13;London to HKG business. Upgraded from PE class so good start. Lounge nice quiet. Boarding chaotic due to families with teenagers choosing the ' small child board early ' call. Lovely onboard crew responsive and friendly. Food great TV excellent slept a lot. Delayed after landing but captain updated us regularly and as usual good effort to transfer connecting pax efficiently. Worlds most efficient airline.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-13;"AMS to HKG Aug 3 and then HKG to SYD Aug 6. 6 ft passenger and 5 ft 6"" passenger Seats 32EG and then 31D E. On both flights the seats were superb - I can't sleep on flights but I felt very comfortable the whole time. Hindu Vegetarian food was excellent. On the 1st flight on the A340 there was only 1 toilet in Premium Economy and on the 2nd flight on the A330 there were no toilets - very annoying and not what you would expect when paying double or triple the economy price. Both flights were very late departing.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-11;Flew from Melbourne to HK then on to London. Back to HK from London. We have a 3 year old and found that only one of our flights was good for her. The staff didn't bother to give her the children's pack or smaller headphones although we were aware that they were available. When we asked for a snack for her they offered peanuts or mentoes hard sweets-both unsuitable for her. On the HK to London flight our attendant was great but all other flights we felt that we were being a nuisance if we asked for anything and even when they said they'd bring us something they didn't get around to it! This was simple requests like an orange juice or an extra bread roll. Our attendant from London to HK was very young and maybe just inexperienced. She was quite unfriendly. Personally I wish we had booked Singapore Airlines but the difference in price was significant. Two of our flights were delayed one by 90 minutes. Not ideal for connecting flights. They did allow our car seat on for free and it was bagged and handled carefully.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-11;I flew Cathay Pacific on three sectors. Auckland - Hong Kong Hong Kong - London and Paris - Hong Kong. All flights were a wonderful experience particularly the two flights to and from Europe on the 777 - 300. Even the flight from Auckland on the ageing Airbus 340 was enjoyable. Comfortable seats good food and wine and friendly and professional staff. The airline certainly deserves its high rating and I would be happy to fly with them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-11;We have recently done an Evergreen Tour which was fantastic but we had to pay for our flights in October and pay for them. Come to the actual tour we could not book seats until 48 hrs before hand. So I stayed up until 11.55pm 48hrs before we flew and there were no seats left - how can that be! On the way home I checked in 48hrs and actual was able to get seats from San Francisco to Hong Kong and Hong Kong to Perth go to get our boarding pass and find out my husband and I aren't even together and yet when looking around behind us the middle four seats people had used them to sleep on because they weren't taken same goes for the two seats The air hostess didn't seem to even care or help us. After experiencing this because of the length of the flights I doubt very much that we will fly with Cathay again. Those hostesses couldn't get us fed quick enough. They left out on a bench nuts and a drink if we needed it.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;CX 506 HKG to KIX on a 25-year-old B747-400. Everything except the landing was very smooth despite bad weather at HKG. The shell seat was a bit cramped but was acceptable for a 3.5 hour flight. Cabin crew was fine although not outstanding. Flight meal was a bit below expectation. Incredible in-flight entertainment providing a wide selection of Western movies and local movies. Flight arrived 30 minutes late. CX 569 KIX to HKG on a new 0.7 year-old B777-300ER. Again flight crew and flight meal were not as good as expected for the best airline in the world otherwise very comfortable seats great management of the flight and again very impressive in-flight entertainment. Flight departed 10 minutes early and arrived more than 30 minutes early which was impressive. Overall I had a feeling that the good standard of Cathay Pacific's catering and cabin services is a bit inconsistent although they are generally stronger than other airlines.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;I generally found there was little value for my money when I flew from HKG to YVR besides the highly capable and friendly air hostess who came rather quickly once the call button was pressed. Credit goes to Cathay for their well-trained and attentive staff. The egg omelette was bland and cold which made it made it fairly unappetizing. The dinner was edible. They had one selection of wine for the six passengers in first class and a different selection of wine available to business class. This basically begs the obvious how much wine could six people drink in 12 hours. My main complaint with the window seats of their newly reconfigured business class is that one could not even look out of the window. It is utterly self-defeating to call these window seats. Unfortunately it doesn't help that their business class seats make one feel like one is lying in a coffin when one adjusts the seat to the flatbed position. As for their dysfunctional armrests I find myself sitting in a chair with my left arm higher than my right arm for 11 plus hours. I could rest my left arm comfortably when I am properly seated but I could not find the expected corresponding position for the right armrest. The selection of movies was forgettable for a long flight like HKG to YVR. The television shows available were equally lousy. Lastly the noodle bar closes at 23.00 hours at their business class lounge called the Pier. This meant anyone who had a flight after midnight had a very limited selection of refreshments at the business lounge. Altogether Cathay needs to either improve the quality of their food and entertainment or start cutting their business class fare.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;HKG-CTS Sapporo 747-400. Check in counter is smooth and fast. AVOD is excellent. Cabin Crew friendly. The fixed shell seats are just ok for day flight or less than 3 hrs. The food taste are not good as before. On time arrival and the bags came before I arrived to the baggage lane.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;Sapporo - Hong Kong 747-400. AVOD has a lot of latest movies and TV shows. The cabin crew serve drinks after take-off. After that they serve dinner. The food is so-so. I arrived Hong Kong 10 mins ahead of schedule. I had to wait 20 mins for my baggage but HKIA is always slow to send baggage.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;CX790 KUL to HKG and CX826 to Toronto. Premium economy seats all the way. The seats are comfy and have great legroom but still feel cramped when the seat in front reclines. On the first leg KUL-HKG there was no drink service before takeoff or a hot towel in sight something Cathay hypes about in their commercials for premium economy. I was disappointed with the meal service as although we were served economy class meals the portions were tiny for a 14.5 hour flight. Staff were great pleasant and courteous and it was always service with a smile. They weren't around much after the meal service but did respond to calls. Personally I do not think these seats are great value for money due to the inadequate meal service and the general similar cramped feeling of economy. The seat mechanism was difficult to work and my seat would not go upright without the help of a steward who said that they were having problems with the premium economy seat recline mechanism.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-06;BKK-HKG on a busy Saturday afternoon in July on an ageing A330-300. The plane looked and felt old and the shell- type seats are not my favourites - but on a full flight they guaranteed a little more privacy and leg room. The flight was on time but otherwise very ordinary really and the staff had to run on this full flight to finish the meal service on time. Moreover the white wine they serve on their short flights is awful and always warm. A very hectic and chaotic experience with a very hard-working staff.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-02;SIN-HKG-SIN on CX650 and CX635 on 25/28 July 2014. Both flights had good on-time departure and arrived on time. For both flights were supposed to experience new CX Business Class seats but alas both flights had a last-minute swap of aircraft's. Not only we had to take regional business class seats twice CX also did not bother to allocate two pax in the same PNR to sit together. Food was okay - better than OZ Business but not as good as SQ Business. IFE and service was good - the earphones were more comfortable than SQ Business. Overall a good experience though I would have given 1 or 2 more stars if not for the equipment change.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-08-02;SIN-HKG-SIN on CX650 and CX635 on 25/28 July 2014. Both flights had good on-time departure and arrived on time. For both flights were supposed to experience new CX Business Class seats but alas both flights had a last-minute swap of aircraft's. Not only we had to take regional business class seats twice CX also did not bother to allocate two pax in the same PNR to sit together. Food was okay - better than OZ Business but not as good as SQ Business. IFE and service was good - the earphones were more comfortable than SQ Business. Overall a good experience though I would have given 1 or 2 more stars if not for the equipment change.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-31;22 July we flew Dragonair to connect with Cathay 0135 from Hong Kong to Melbourne. We missed our connection and began a 48 hour ordeal exacerbated by poor customer service a lost bag airline transfers that left us sandwiched between babies and high school kids on Thai Airways into Sydney with a seven hour wait before we boarded a flight into Adelaide. All together this was a horrible trip. Cathay has promised to be in touch but we're home four days and nothing. Let's face it - an airline is about what happens both in the air and on the ground. Disappointing.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-31;CX100 7th July CX233 8th July and CX292 21st July CX139 22 July. All Business Class. Have travelled with CP several times in the past and the service this time was at its usual high standard. However the food served on the two legs - SYD-HKG HKG - Milan and return was extremely poor. Most meals I chose to refuse after one taste. Extremely disappointing!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-31;Went ORD-HKG-NRT and HND-HKG-ORD. Inflight service was good with very attentive staff and they actually went out of the way to help me with my carry-on luggage. In-flight entertainment system was very good and easy to navigate.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-31;Flew Business Class Auckland-Hong Kong-London return. Very good service on all flights. Lounges good with food and service excellent. I usually fly with AirNZ which is my favourite airline. Cathay every bit as good and special fare extremely reasonable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-29;"CX841 from New York JFK to HKG. Flight used a fairly new 777-300ER. There was priority boarding for first business premium economy then the passengers at the rear rows of the economy class cabin. Because of my seat being at the very rear of the cabin seat 67A I was able to board earlier than some. Cabin Crew were very friendly and responsive. The food was pretty good I had the fish option which consisted of Baked Salmon with black pepper sauce lima beans and carrots and spinach mashed potatoes. On the side was a warm bun with butter and a chicken salad. There was also a haagen-dazz ice cream for dessert. As this was a 16 hour flight we were offered a second meal in which I got the chicken with rice option that came with a peach yoghurt cake topped with honey toasted oatmeal a fruit salad and once again a warm bun with butter. The seats were fairly comfortable and I was very thankful not to be on a flight with the old fixed shell seats. The AVOD at my seat was horrible. It would not respond to my touch at all or would take more than 5 minutes. I alerted the cabin crew they told me that I had to take it slow. After showing them that it didn't work they went back to the galley apparently ""reset"" the AVOD and told me to try again. They ignored me after that. A tip for all you others out there traveling on long distance flights on the 777-300ERs. At the rear galley there is a snack tray or bin with peanuts chips and other goodies if you feel hungry between meals.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-29;PVG-SYD. Dragonair Business to HKG Cathay Premium Economy CX101 HKG-SYD. After many years of flying the Shanghai- Sydney route decided to try Cathay PE. While it was acceptable it is certainly nothing to get excited about. As with many other comments I agree it is slightly better than standard economy and far inferior to Business. While not being so interested in the food or entertainment both of which were fine I am much more interested in the comfort factor. Cathay PE does not meet my requirements. Both meal services dinner on departure and breakfast before arrival the empty food trays sat for far too long obviously the staff serve PE first then do the economy cabin service so it can be a long time before they return to collect the food tray. Cabin lights remained fully lit well into the 23:55 flight departure. They advertised an amenity kit that provides eye shades but I was never offered one. A pillow over my face eliminated some of the light. Bathroom is shared with economy this is not good. The economy flight crew work the PE cabin while we all sat there with empty food trays in front of us Business Class crew and the purser made a number of trips through the cabin and completely ignored the fact that the cabin needed service. My result is either take a daytime economy flight or upgrade to business. PE is not value for money a separate bathroom and a couple of dedicated cabin staff would make the experience better. Cathay need to learn something from Turkish Airlines their Comfort Class works very well.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-29;CX659 20 July 2014. Flying from Taipei to Singapore transit in HK. When boarding the flight from Taipei the plane was so hot. Only box of snacks served. The flight from HKG to SIN the seat was uncomfortable as it can't be reclined back only the inner part is reclineable which is uncomfortable. Box of snacks is served around 1 hour later around 2.30am when people are starting to sleep instead of before arriving as a breakfast. The plane was cold to start with but then was very hot and with no air circulation.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-29;MEL-HKG-HND-HKG-BKK-HKG-NRT-HKG-MEL. Flown CX all around Asia in the past 3.5 weeks and experienced all their fleet from the shell seat to the new seats found the new seats to be nice and wide but also hard under the legs. Shell seat well what were they thinking? All flights were delayed upwards of 30+ minutes that's right all! Crew well they make the airline and most of them couldn't be found after service was complete. The 747 I flew on needed some seat repairs as there were parts missing or taped over and the cleanliness was not exactly great. I didn't appreciate the fact that my table on a few flights was filthy. I do however like the fact that they fly to HND and that makes them a much better option than QF. Meal portions very small but overall ok. I'll give them a second go.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-27;"Melbourne - Hong Kong - Frankfurt and return. Melbourne lounge dreadful - cramped viewless and poor food. Boarding chaotic especially in Hong Kong. Inflight service inconsistent - it seems business passengers are serviced last? The entire right hand side of the business class cabin was not offered bread during the meal service yet we all watched the basket being carried up and down the other aisle. Food not that good either - although of higher quality out of Melbourne and Frankfurt than Hong Kong. Requests for items (pillows drinks) required 2-3 times. They ran out of my preferred meal choice on both legs ""we did not expect Caucasians to order it"" said my flight attendant. Seat impossible to get comfortable on. I am only 172cm tall and 70kg but could not get a comfortable position. Odd padding sections on the seats and the very narrow foot well when sleeping filled me with regret that I had allowed myself to be talked into flying Cathay by my partner and not chosen to fly Singapore Airlines where you can stretch out and get proper service (in my view Singapore Airlines economy service is better than the Cathay business service).";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-22;Cebu to HK to London. I had to wait for 20 minutes before I could check in even though I was travelling business class Marco Polo always get priority and there was no dedicated Marco Polo check in as it is shared. Lounge at Cebu is OK but very limited in choice of food and drinks. Left on time and arrived on time crew was the best I have ever experienced on Cebu to HK and vice versa. Arrived on time and boarded my flight to London the crew was very good as usual however again no vegetarian choice luckily I was not hungry. Film selection is a little poor this time hopefully next time it will be better.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-22;CGK-HKG-CGK. CGK-HKG on regional A330-300. Up-to-date touch screen IFE. New and fresh regional cabin. Smooth take- off and landing. Food is a bit disappointing in volume and taste. Choice of drinks is also limited but acceptable. HKG-CGK on older regional B777-300. IFE is up-to-date with touch-screen function but fixed-shell economy seat a bit uncomfortable. Cabin crew should reduce their volume if they want to have some chit chat around the galley or at the very back of the plane so they do not disturb resting passengers.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-22;"CX 521 from Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong and CX 659 from Hong Kong to Singapore. Both trips were on the B777-300ER. Seats on these planes were so much better than the shell seats. They were the new ones used on the long haul routes. The touch screen PTVs were really sensitive which was good as compared to those on the old systems of the 777-300 and A330-300 as they hanged a couple of times when I used them. However not all was good. CX 521 was delayed for 2 hours because of bad weather at Hong Kong. We were only given a 500yen food voucher which was equivalent to 6 Singapore dollars. Anyway we were served coffee and tea from Tokyo to Hong Kong which really surprised me since they didn't do that for the Singapore to Hong Kong leg as well as the Hong Kong to Tokyo one. Service was a hit-and-miss affair but the staff were generally very polite with a few exceptions. The overnight ""meals"" offered on all Cathay Pacific regional red-eye flights: CX 659 was a red-eye flight and we were not offered any hot meals. We were only given a paper box which contained a muffin fruits a biscuit and an egg bun accompanied by a pack of lemon tea. I get that some passengers want to get some rest but they should have at least served hot meals to those who were awake. Nevertheless the flights were good because of the comfortable seats.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-22;Maybe I was expecting too much from a regional flight. I was on CX 716 from Singapore to Hong Kong on 14th July. The economy class seats were the notorious shell seats and it was extremely uncomfortable. There was no lumbar support and the seat back was really hard. There was also no foot rest. In addition amenity kits and menus were not given out to us. What's worse was that when we boarded the flight not every seat had blankets and pillows on them and they were only available upon request and the entire process of passengers settling down into their seats was extremely chaotic as several passengers started requesting blankets and pillows from the cabin crew during pushback and the cabin crew were hurrying back and forth just to hand them the blankets and pillows. The food portions were also pretty small and I was still famished even after the meal service. The cutlery provided was also made of cheap plastic and not metal unlike on some other airlines. We were also not served tea or coffee throughout the flight. The cabin crew were in a rush to collect the meal trays from the passengers and when the pilot came on the speaker and requested for the cabin crew to take their seats for landing they did not even conduct a safety check for us such as making sure our seat belts were fastened window shades were lifted and hand carry items were placed under the seat in front of us. The only positive on my outbound journey from Singapore to Tokyo was that the cabin crew were really friendly and were always smiling. My inbound journey on CX was much better. I'll post a review on it after this.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-22;AKL-HKG codeshared as an NZ booking. The A340 has the slide down seats that many hate but I love. Great lumbar support and it doesn't matter if the persons in front/behind want to eat sleep or whatever. Lunch was very good. arrival snack was good. All services were nice and efficient. Between NZ and CX I'd pick CX operated flights every time!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-20;Hong Kong to Manila flight CX903 operated by a Boeing 777-300ER (77A) First Class Configuration. Premium Economy Class had large PTV screens but meal service was the same as Economy although it was priority boarding and check- in. We were actually upgraded round-trip because of Marco Polo Club. The IFE did not have movies but it had TV shows. I asked the cabin crew for some playing cards and they gave me 2 packs.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-17;HKG-DPS-HKG in June 2014. Flight was excellent. The food and services were great. Check-in and boarding was fast and easy. Entertainment is on-demand with lots of choices from Hollywood to Bollywood that makes the 4.5 hr journey much more tolerable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-17;HKG-BKK. Short flight on the 777-300. Adequate legroom inflight entertainment is outdated but was ok for a short trip. Food was fine. Service was excellent.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-17;Recently flew return HKG-YVR on CX888/889 combo. Missed the cheaper fares on Chinese carriers so elected to fly Cathay instead of Air Canada. Early morning departures from both ends but earlier flights were more expensive. Flights were very good but more comfortable on the return as we managed to get the back row of the 777 (row 72 a and c no middle seat). That row had more legroom too and being near the toilet/galley wasn't an issue. Food seemed above average for economy class fare but I do wish CX would offer drinks before serving the meal. I wanted a G+T but not with my meal! Entertainment system whilst not up to Emirates standard was more than adequate even for a flight of over 12 hours. Snacks available in the galley between meals if peckish. Was surprised that economy class had so few toilets one of which was very narrow indeed. Flights arrived on time. Cabin crew professional as one would expect from CX. Baggage very slow on arrival at HKG but not the airline's fault.;POSITIVE

The seat is good but everything else was mediocre at best. Lounge at Changi airport dreadful no proper business class queue at gate. No priority passport lines either at Changi or Hong-Kong airports. Walking distance from Lounge to departure gate at HKG is insane. In-flight service on both flights was all done in a hurry by noticeably overworked crew. Food was very mediocre. have had much better meals on many coach flights. Seat folds out to flat bed but on the A330 service HKG-CNS the small cubby hole where Your feet go the feet feel claustrophobic and it was boiling hot in there. The only Kudos for Cathay is the WING 1st Class lounge at HKG Airport with its great Cabanas and menu-restaurant dinner.;NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-17;16/7/14 CX505 NRT-HKG. B777-300 aircraft registration B-HNN. Got these 4 flights at S$660 so it was the best value for money. Checked in online. There was a separate line for online check in at NRT so we breezed through check-in in a jiffy especially since there was almost no queue due to our early arrival. The plane was old and dated but with a refurbished interior with AVOD entertainment a huge difference from their ancient A330s and a few un-refurbished B777-300s and B777-200s. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was efficient and friendly. A full bar service with peanuts distributed followed by dinner meal service and trays of drinks after that with bar service on request. Food was decent and edible but nothing to write home about.;POSITIVE

There was a separate line for online check in at SIN so we breezed through check-in in a jiffy. SIN is always efficient anyway. Boarding was on time and by seat numbers. The plane was old and dated but with a refurbished interior with AVOD entertainment a huge difference from their ancient A330s and a few un- refurbished B777-300s and B777-200s. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was efficient and friendly. A quick service of water juices and beer on a tray with peanuts distributed followed by meal service and nothing after that service by request only. We had a choice of chicken penne with tomato sauce or sweet and sour fish with rice and Haagen Daz ice cream. Food was decent and edible but nothing to write home about. My companion asked for an additional main course since he found the portions small. His request was granted after the meal service ended. Great service.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-17;11/7/14 CX500 HKG-NRT. B777-300 aircraft registration B-HNI. Got these 4 flights at S$660 so its the best value for money. Transited through HKG from CX736. Boarding was on time and by seat numbers. The plane was old and dated but with a refurbished interior with AVOD entertainment a huge difference from their ancient A330s and a few un- refurbished B777-300s and B777-200s. The AVOD was easy to use and had up to date movies. Music selection was really good for Asian music with new mandopop albums available. Inflight service was efficient and friendly. A full bar service with peanuts distributed followed by dinner meal service and drinks on a tray brought about twice. We had a choice of vegetarian mushroom fusilli with tomato sauce or pork with Chinese sauce with rice and Haagen Daz ice cream. Food was better on this leg. On this flight I had this fantastic female cabin crew member serving our side. During the bar service I asked for a gin and tonic and while making it she asked for my nationality then began chatting with me. I requested a set of playing cards as a souvenir and was given a writing kit in addition to the cards. I have flown 10 flights with CX and this was by far the best flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-10;Overall a good airline but seats could be more comfortable. My biggest complaint is that after meal service the crew disappear and it is almost impossible to drag them out of the galley for service. This is not the first time I have experienced this on Cathay Pacific. Food is good but portions are very small.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-10;We have just flown CX 111 Premium Economy to Rotterdam. Unfortunately the airline code shared from Hong Kong to Heathrow and then Rotterdam with British Airways. Cathay Pacific was light years better than BA. The plane was quieter the food and drinks much better the staff more attentive and friendly and the seats much much more comfortable compared to BA. The seat cushion was softer and the recline better the pillow almost full size and the blanket softer and larger. The entertainment system on BA kept cutting out. I would give Cathay 8 out of 10 and BA 6 out of 10.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-10;Bangalore to Los Angeles leaving Bangalore by KA 153 to travel on 4 Jul. (Seat No 29 A and C). The flight got delayed and left Bangalore at 05.55 hrs. We were accommodated on a connecting flight No CX 882 (Seat No 40 A and B) leaving Hong Kong in the afternoon. We had requested for Asian Vegetarian food which we got on the flight from Bangalore to Hong Kong on Dragonair. To our surprise in the menu card on CX 882 the first meal was vegetarian pasta. On requesting this the hostess said they had no vegetarian food and offered us cup noodles. Vegetarian food needs to be provided on all the flights.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-10;LHR-HKG-LHR. Seasoned traveller. Very disappointing service and food availability. Take-off delayed by over 2hrs due to 'troubleshooting' and only offered cups of lukewarm water after 1.5hrs of sitting on an uncomfortably warm full plane parked at the gate. First drinks service was very slow and ran out of a number of soft drinks (surprising as this was the first drinks service and we were in 5th row they served). Highly disappointed to be told during lunch service that had ran out of chicken (I reiterate we were in the 5th row they served) and only beef or vegetable pasta were available. More foresight needed when planning food demand or perhaps need better menu options if the majority of passengers were rejecting the beef? Food portions were also smaller than on other airlines and a mini KitKat does not constitute a 'dessert' when most other airlines would offer the KitKat as an addition to the 3 courses. No tea/coffee offered proactively after the lunch service needed to ask the FA for this. Only one meat option available again at dinner service (other meat option had again 'run out') or vegetable option. To their credit cabin crew were very apologetic and seemed almost embarrassed to tell us that it had happened again. Snacks counter was set up in the galley with a small assortment of sweet and savoury snacks that were regularly replenished. Cabin crew were very obliging when asked for non-alcoholic drinks. Seat seemed narrower than other airline economy seats and age-old problem once seat in front is fully-reclined does apply here. near impossible to reach my bag on the floor. Toilets were very clean and I did witness cabin crew doing regular checks of the facilities armed with air freshener. Inflight entertainment system was very good with many new movies available for viewing - adverts before every film/TV episode is annoying but you can fast forward through these. Overall poor flight experience but credit to good cabin crew. Only chose Cathay Pacific this time as flight time was more suited to my schedule but will definitely not choose Cathay over Emirates ever again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-08;BKK-HKG-LAX on CX-708 and CX-882. BKK-HKG flight was ok for both the seat and meal. For HKG-LAX section flight was on time even though we left Hong Kong almost 30 minutes late due to security checking. Two meals and snack during the flight were adequate. Entertainment system was good.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-08;Flew from CGK-HKG. Very disappointed with the service and the product CX actually offers as a 5 star airline flew with CX798 on the way to HKG. Upon boarding I had very high hopes for CX. Very surprised with the FA's on this flight - they rarely interacted with passengers and some were chatting with colleagues in the cabin upon boarding. The food was not reasonable for a 4.5 hour flight received a cold and not very nice sandwich in a box. My back ached due to the poor quality seats in economy. We hardly saw the crew in the cabin. The entertainment service was the only decent part of my journey movies were very up to date and kept us occupied for 4.5 hour flight. Overall will never fly with CX again.;NEGATIVE

Terribly uncomfortable seats foot rest awful design would not work properly staff had to help each flight. Recliner button did not work both flights. Toilet access very bad. Inflight entertainment excellent food pleasant. Cabin crew extremely nice helpful. Prem Y? It's how normal Econ should be. Back to QF whatever the price their comfort in seating excels. One good thing at least was that the bags were interlined correctly and arrived safely in Copenhagen. No access to lounges as QF Club silver - disappointing.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-06;SIN-HKG-JFK. Both sectors departed and arrived on time. Was glad to have been on the 777-300ER from SIN instead of the A330 with the dated uncomfortable seats. Service on both sectors consistently good friendly and efficient. Meals sadly seemed to let the whole CX experience down. Portions are small and very uninspired. The meals on the long haul to NY were identical in size but were preceded with a menu. No hot towels or cold towellettes distributed. Crew were however very pleasant throughout the long nonstop and very obliging with drinks snacks. A snack counter was set up with a limited selection of drinks and eats. Cabin and toilets clean and seat comfort held for the 15 hours just. IFE selection was pretty good too. While everything works and is adequate it's not quite a 5 star airline experience in CX economy.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-06;KIX-HKG. Boeing 747-400. In Premium Economy class. This aircraft has own Premium Economy washroom. KIX onboard meal is much better than ex HKG. KIX boarding gate is a bit far as usual. Inflight Entertainment has new movies. Cabin Crews are friendly. Washroom is clean. Arrival HKG on-time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-06;HKG-KIX in Premium Economy. Airbus 330-300. The seat is great. Whole cabin is full. The food a bit worse than before. Inflight Entertainment is excellent. Cabin Crew friendly and helpful. Early 10 mins arrival KIX. Baggage had been delivered when I arrived to the baggage hall.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-06;HKG - Bangkok economy. Flight out a bit late but made up time on way. Newish plane good AVOD and food. Usual efficient and friendly service from CX. Return also good. Good meal choices service with a smile large wines given quickly and all in all very impressive. Only down was landing at gate 65 which is possibly the furthest gate ever!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-07-06;CX714 15th June from Singapore to Hong Kong and it was an excellent journey. Surprisingly the flight took off a few minutes early and we arrived to our final destination 15 minutes earlier than scheduled. It was a 3.5 hours flight and no complaints at all the entire journey with Cathay Pacific was a pleasure.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-30;PE is not Business Class (J) so if you are looking for J PE is not for you. Having said that PE on Cathay Pacific (CX) is OK. Seats are comfortable food is good there is room to move. The only downside is that the toilets are shared with Economy on the A330 and some B777. Would I fly with CX again and in PE Yes and No.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-30;Melbourne to Hong Kong economy class. Excellent service great food menu provided was I nice touch good wine entertainment was good but there were limited movies. It was inconvenient using the lavatory as 2 of the 5 economy toilets were out of service. We had to queue up for almost 10 minutes in the aisle to use it. I was very happy with the flight and it was definitely worth flying Cathay Pacific.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-25;London to Hong Kong then onto Cebu. I was boarded first due to my hearing loss the flight left 20 minutes late but arrived in HK on time. The staff are still very good and friendly however they didn't have any fish cakes for my main course left and I was not able to eat meat - quite disappointed however they were very apologetic. They should have anticipated the demand. HKG to Cebu: Flight was 45 minutes late taking off and landed 30 minutes late a little surprised to be boarded on a new A330 airbus however the business class seats which is the same for long distance seems a little smaller compare to the Boeing 777. A major cock up with the stewardess only giving us two forms one for health and the other for passport and forgotten to give us another form for custom chaos at customs as none of the passengers had forms to give them. A real hassle also there was no meet and greet for me either. Fingers crossed my return trip next month will be much better.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-23;Flew from Hong Kong to Brisbane via Cairns in May. We were offloaded from Virgin Atlantic to Cathay and paid to travel Premium Economy. We did get a wider seat but the cold hard muffin yoghurt and orange juice breakfast had to be a basic as they could get. I don't know what they got in economy but it couldn't have been any less. Hardly saw the staff they just weren't there or interested. We had to walk a long way through the economy class to get to the toilets so didn't gain anything for having paid extra. Unless you need the slightly larger seat don't waste your money paying extra fro premium economy as you don't gain anything.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-23;"Flew Premium Economy LAX-HKG-LAX on 777-ER. I have read many prior reviews about CP PE and the main point is that this product should only be compared to Economy not Business Class. I have also flown CP BC and it is a great experience all around. I am 6'2"" and the days of flying Economy across the Pacific are over! Understanding that the price can be about double after 15 hours I believe well worth the price. Was able to board early on both legs. Had a dedicated overhead bin. The private cabin in a plus. The seat was fantastic 34C which was back seat aisle. A bonus was the extra storage behind the seat. Even when the seat in front was fully reclined I never felt uncomfortable. The width of the seat the arm rest and comfort of the seat were all good! The entertainment system was fantastic! The noise cancelling headphones were excellent. I found the service to be adequate the food options were the same as BC including the wine options. Real silverware and linen. Had no problems getting drink refills or snacks. Had no problems sleeping had superb legroom. The adjustable headrest is a great plus! Able to de-plane ahead of EC which is nice. The extra price was definitely worth it to me as I felt completely rested after both legs which is invaluable. Also you if you have the opportunity to use SkyPier at HKG do it! Less than five minutes to get through immigration customs and security! Amazing experience! The check-in desks at SkyPier are efficient and fast! You take a short shuttle train to connect to the main terminal.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-23;Hong Kong to London Heathrow. The flight left a little late but the new business class on this 777 was truly exceptional and I enjoyed every moment of the 12 hour flight. I even managed to get 6 hours sleep on what I think is a very comfortable bed. The food was very good with a nice selection the lamb shoulder confit was superb as was the pork which was served as dinner before landing. The wines were good again a good choice. The cabin staff were very professional and helpful always there. Overall a great journey and my new favourite airline for business class.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-23;I am a 69 y/o seasoned traveller. I am mobility impaired following a series of joint replacements. I recently flew with Cathay Pacific return from South Africa to China via Hong Kong as a single traveller. I want to thank them for their fantastic service! From the moment that I arrived at the airport in Johannesburg - I was well supported and I received assistance with my mobility issues in a professional and caring manner.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-20;Hong Kong. Beijing June 19 Business Class. Extremely comfortable short flight. Private lie flat seats on the A330 with great entertainment options. Decent breakfast served appropriate for the regional service by an efficient but not at all warm cabin crew. All in all US and European airlines could learn a lot about how to do regional first/business right. I would never hesitate to fly or recommend this carrier in the future.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-20;Economy class SYD-HKG-EWR. Professional and respectful service on both legs and it was particularly good on the HKG-EWR leg. The HKG-EWR flight is one of the longest flights in the world but I found it very comfortable. After a 15 hr 20 min flight I emerged feeling pretty good. Seats are good good choice of food and sufficient variety in the IFE choices to keep passengers entertained. Cabin crew took care to ensure cabin and toilets remained clean throughout. They also came around regularly offering drinks an essential but often overlooked need on ultra-long flights.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-13;"Sydney - HKG - Milan and return Premium Economy. Sadly disappointed. Having flown premium economy or business on a number of airlines in recent years this definitely felt ""economy"". Service food and beverages were very average. Seat and entertainment acceptable. I note that the cost was equivalent to Singapore Airlines economy class via Singapore. Next time we'll opt for SA. Neither the food or the beverages offered were business class equivalent. Did I misunderstand what we were paying for? The crew were rarely seen but happy to step across passengers in the front row. No ""excuse me's"" were offered. The only flight where service was up to standard was HK-Sydney when the aircraft was not full. If this was ""premium"" we'll opt for economy on another airline!";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-12;"My family and I have recently traveled on the first class seats of the 777-300er. It was a ""rather"" comfortable seat. It is a lovely experience because with just one click of a button you can transform the seat into a bed. The cost of the seat was a bit expensive but it was worth it. The staff service is excellent because of how fast they help you and how they remember your names. The food was okay but not the best. The inflight entertainment was okay very high quality but lack of movies. Overall I think that the first class experience is very good.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-12;My wife and I travelled 4 sectors in Cathay Business Class recently (CX110/CX261?CX260/CX139). We have a benchmark from travelling frequently with Qantas in Business. Several major aspects warrant comment. My wife is diabetic which was nominated at the time of booking. On one long overnight sector she asked for a light snack as she had to take medication. The staff member disregarded the request and offered no snack. However on the return long overnight sector a staff member when asked offered that a special snack had been loaded and was most obliging. What an inconsistency in the attitude of cabin staff. There appears to be no small snacks available at any time as is the case with competitors. Seat allocation. Was arranged at the time of booking which was some six months prior to departure. Boarding passes were issued at Sydney for the two sectors. Upon presentation at Hong Kong we were informed of a problem i.e the seat was broken and would not recline thus was unusable. We were asked to go to one side whereon we asked for a supervisor. Apparently our adjoining seats were not possible as one seat was broken (by coincidence the frequent flyer award seat). As the flight was almost fully booked we were allocated seats apart five and six rows behind. As it was nearly midnight we had little alternative. Upon boarding we overheard a passenger seating next to my wife who wished to be repositioned nearer his friend. We were able to sort this out and then inform cabin staff. Sometime later (there was an hour and a half delay before takeoff due to weather conditions) we noticed the original seat was occupied and was fully reclined. This seat was the frequent flyer seat.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-10;My wife and I recently flew MEL-HKG-KIX and return and found the airline's standards have fallen since we last flew with them several years ago. The 777 seating between Hong Kong and Japan was particularly uncomfortable food on all legs was some of the worst we'd had eg. braised beef between MEL and HKG was almost all fat while 3 of the 5 Western meals on the HKG-MEL leg had onion sauce &/or onion ingredients. We were laughed at by the cabin staff member when in response to her question we asked for diet coke with our main meal between HKG and MEL. The entertainment system is good but there was little difference between the May programs and those on offer in June. Also the same advertisements before each program are very annoying after a while but at least you can fast forward through them. I doubt we would choose Cathay Pacific ahead of Singapore Airlines in future.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-09;Flight from HKG-DPS return business class both ways. HKG-DPS older 777 seats went out with the arc. hardly any choice on the IFE. Trip only saved by the friendly and efficient staff. Return leg changed aircraft to 747. Uncomfortable seating. headphones did not work. Staff offered me a change of seat but was a baby right in front of new seat so politely declined.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-08;Hong Kong-Bangkok-Hong Kong outbound flight CX705 was half empty. Services were standard. However there was no inflight entertainment system. The inbound flight CX616 was cancelled without prior notice even though I already provided the airline with my full contact details including email when I bought the ticket online. Check-in staff said the flight was cancelled because the airplane didn't arrive from Hong Kong last night due to operational issues. If so the airline should have had sufficient time to notice passengers. I was transferred to another flight 3hrs later. The flight was packed. The services were standard as per usual. Again there was no inflight entertainment system.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-01;Wonderful experience aboard Cathay Pacific. Had to fly to London and back in 72 hours so needed to be comfortable. Long haul business class beds on Cathay Pacific are the most comfortable I've flown and I managed to comfortably sleep 7.5 hours on the long haul flights. The staff are amazing. They all remember passengers by name throughout the flight. Studio CX IFE was great. The food delicious and plentiful. A perfect experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-01;We flew BNE-LHR via HKG on 29th May. Really excellent product seats are much more comfortable than Economy and it is much easier to sleep. First meal is business class quality and second is economy - all round the food and cabin service was excellent. Priority boarding also in Brisbane and Hong Kong was appreciated. The small cabin made for 2 very quiet flights. Thank you Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-06-01;JFK-HKG-SYD. No mention at the boarding gate for Premium Economy guests to board before Economy. Had a champagne prior to take off which was an improvement over our previous flight on Virgin Atlantic. The cabin service was friendly and attentive. The food was very poor the worst I have had to be honest not even Economy standard. The seats were wide but the old bugbear when the seat in front reclines fully is still a problem in Premium Economy it is very intrusive and you need the passenger next to you to climb out if you want to get past them. We got more sleep than previous flights in Economy but it is still a fairly uncomfortable experience. The noise-cancelling headphones were a great feature and you could actually hear and enjoy the comprehensive entertainment selection. The cabin noise was quiet having only 38 passengers and a dedicated toilet was a good feature on the JFK-HGK leg but we had to use the Economy toilets for the second leg (different aircraft). This was our first experience in Premium Economy and while it was a slight step up from Economy I do not think it is worth the extra money. Apart from the entertainment selection and wider seats it felt more like an Economy experience than Premium Economy to be honest. We would fly Economy next time have stopovers and avoid flying a 14 hour leg if we could as you do not arrive at your destination feeling particularly refreshed.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-29;My wife and I (both seniors) were in Premium Economy Class (Seats 31H and 31K) on flight CX879 from SFO to HKG (with connection to BLR) on 12th September 2013. During our onward flight from HKG to SFO in March 2013 we had felt very cramped in Economy Class and so we got our tickets upgraded for our return journey in September. Little did we know at that time what a wise decision that was. After the flight CX879 took off on 12th September 2013 the elderly passenger in front of us took ill. The flight was diverted to Anchorage in order to offload the passenger and then we landed at Taipei for crew change. Finally after being in the aircraft for 20 hours we landed at HKG on 14th morning very tired. We had of course missed the connecting flight. We were afraid that there would be a crowd and big confusion at the transfer counter. We thought we might have to spend long hours at the airport. We were in for a delightful surprise. We found a long table arranged with all the new boarding passes envelopes with hotel coupons and cash for meals also instructions for transport to hotel. We could not believe our eyes. We were accommodated at J W Marriott where we could take good rest and take the BLR flight on 14th night. We should also add that the 20-hour flight was made bearable because we were in Premium Economy. One complaint: On that long flight no clear announcements were made about our landing time arrangements made for connecting flights etc. Because of my good experience with CP last year I am again travelling BLR-HKG-SFO on July 22 2014 by Premium Economy. Even though the price was high for me I still decided to pay extra for the comfort.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-27;Cairns - Hong Kong return. My seat tray table and screen had dirt on it and a repulsive odour. Flight attendant didn't care but did give me a towelette. Food was poor. Return night flight had dreadful service no hot beverages at all. Limited choices of others. The FA walked through a couple of times only with a couple of drinks on a tray and did his best to ignore everyone. The in-flight announcements in English were incomprehensible. These planes did not have any personal airjets and were uncomfortably warm.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-25;On flight CX 749 from Hong Kong to Johannesburg Wednesday 23 April 2014 my friend became ill and went into a semi coma. The staff were brilliant and two staff were excellent for the efficient way in which they dealt with the person. Thank you for all the support! to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-25;I am a fan of Cathay Pacific. They seem to me to be the most consistent in cabin service wherever you embark. Mostly I have travelled Business Class but have also travelled Economy on one occasion. I like a clean cabin and clean wash room facilities. Cathay Pacific seem to ensure that this is the case. The crew provide efficient helpful and pleasant service. Our last flight was LHR-HKG then HKG-MEL in May 2014. I like the flat beds on the Cathay Pacific 777. To me they seem longer than other airlines flat beds. LHR-HKG we were given Billecart Salmon champagne and very nice it was too. On the HKG to MEL leg it was Deutz. Not quite as nice as the Billecart. Food varied from good to excellent. The array of entertainment options was comprehensive.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-23;ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-21;Melbourne-Rome return. First leg of flight fantastic service great stop in Hong Kong of 6 hrs a bit of a drag second half much better due to larger seats but service great all the way. My travel friend had difficulties walking and was offered wheelchair assistance for all the flights - they were wonderful and friendly putting her and myself at ease. Flights home even better. Thank you to all the staff who helped us have a great holiday.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-21;"Heathrow to Denpasar (Bali) transiting in Hong Kong. Overall a very positive experience especially for the money (585 pounds return which is exceptional value). The choice of entertainment isn't as extensive as on Emirates or SIA but was adequate with several of the latest movies offered. Service was friendly and prompt. Food and beverages were hit and miss but having apples nuts and noodles available between meals was a nice touch. I'm 6""3 but found the seat comfortable enough for a long flight.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-20;Vancouver to Hong Kong. Flight was pretty uneventful other than three infants on board which didn't stop crying but that's not the airline's fault. FAs were very attentive and went through the cabin with a tray full of cooked cup noodles and offered them to anyone that wants one midflight. Very good IFE with some of the most recent movies available.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-16;Perth to Hong Kong in business class the first time that I have used Cathay Pacific. The seats are very comfortable with power recline and are able to lay flat if you need to sleep. These pod seats are fairly private and the food and cabin crew are outstanding. The food included fresh fruit croissants salmon Kung po chicken and various other delights. A choice of beverages was extensive.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-13;I was very disappointed with our flight from Rome to Hong Kong (flight CX292) on 7 May 2014. My son was travel sick and the flight crew were very unhelpful. Also service of water and snacks during the night was very poor. I had to ask for water and when I asked for assistance with my son none was given.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-11;I flew on CX 889 from Vancouver to Hong Kong and found that the seats are too cramped and very uncomfortable. It was a Boeing 777-300ER plane and the seats were badly modified to make them closer to each other probably to accommodate more passengers. After the flight I couldn't walk as my legs became swollen due the cramped seating positions. My previous flights with Cathay Pacific weren't like this at all the seats were less congested and there were more leg room. On other recent flights like CX 2710 from Colombo to Singapore it was the same plane model Boeing 777-300ER yet the seats and leg rooms are adequate. (5hrs flight journey). Hope that Cathay can make amends on the seats for the flights to and from Vancouver.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-11;Dubai to Tokyo Haneda via Hong Kong. Price wise from Dubai Cathay is the best value for money to fly anywhere in Asia and given the fact that the first experiment went well I didn't hesitate to go for the next one. I was right again. Cathay is outstanding value for money to travel in Asia from Dubai. The first leg from Dubai to Hong Kong was flown on a 330-300 fairly new with the newest business class which is equivalent to first class in terms of comfort. Fully flat lie beds with a huge monitor plentiful of entertainment and nice environment. Service on- board is excellent. Service is prompt and flight assistants were excellent. The second leg was flown by an older 747 with an old seat configuration it can still convert into an 180 degrees bed but in my opinion it's not as comfortable for a 6 foot tall passenger even worse if the person is robust. In my case it was more than comfortable and the trip lasts between 3.5 and 4 hours. With a vast variety of lounges the waiting time at HK airport is no issue. Overall a wonderful experience and with these fares I'd only opt for Cathay for my Asian trips.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-08;I flew to and from KL-HK-KL. Flight was delayed 2 hours ex-KLIA. Cabin was very hot both ways. Food is below average. Inflight entertainment is below par. At both airports check in took a while even though it was only to drop off the bag. All in the experience was average. I have had better experiences in other airlines.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-06;DOH-HKG Airbus 330-300. Business Class. It is many years since I was a Diamond member of Cathay this is my first flight with them for nearly 15 years. Although the service was good they have gone downhill since my last journey. The seats are a strange design almost coffin like the food is pretty average as is the wine choice. No sleepwear like Qatar. The juice is carton not fresh. Overall although a safe trip not worth the money they charge.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-06;Last year I flew from Sydney to Hong Kong the flight was delayed 2 hours which wasn't too bad. Onboard the flight the food was good for an economy class ticket the seats where comfortable and the entertainment was excellent. The flight attendants were very nice pleasant and helpful. Overall the flight was good and pleasant and I would recommend that anyone who's deciding on an airline to fly on should consider flying Cathay Pacific Airways.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-05;My flight from SIN-HKG was terrible. There was no food and no in-flight entertainment system. Flight was delayed by 24 hours.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-05;My family and I just flew from YYZ-HKG-KUL in February 2014. I must say it was a very long flight from YYZ-HKG. The check-in was very smooth and we got the boarding passes for both our sectors right at YYZ. The flight was wonderful. The IFE the meals the flight crew were all top notch. The cabin crew were very friendly and caring. Their service was exceptional. There were enough snacks made available to the passengers throughout the flight. The seating was okay. The kids really enjoyed the IFE contents. The transit at HKG was pretty quick and our next flight from HKG-KUL was excellent as well. Overall were had a wonderful flight on both sectors. Thanks to the wonderful crew of Cathay Pacific for making our flight an enjoyable one and I would definitely be flying with them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-05-04;Flew from CDG to HKG and HKG to AKL return. The service was excellent. I had swollen legs from the first flight and a customer service rep helped me get a visa in to Hong Kong so I could see a doctor and then got me extra legroom on the next flight. Flight attendants checked on me every 20 minutes or so and got me extra blankets and water as needed. I was very taken care of and they went the extra mile. Overall all 4 flights were great: on time with good food and excellent entertainment. Seats weren't great- the life vest thing is in the seatbelt - but it's economy class. The bathrooms were cleaned often so were sparkling. Overall 4 excellent flights and I would happily take them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-30;BAH-MNL delivered a superb service. Cabin crew always friendly and approachable. Inflight entertainment excellent only downside of this particular trip for me was the food as I am not a fan of duck and salmon. This was my 7th time flying with them 8th next month and I cant think of any reason why I wont fly with them for the 9th 10th and so on.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-28;HKG-LHR 25th April 2014 CX253. The first time I have flown with Cathay Pacific and it won't be the last. Excellent service throughout. Flew outward premium economy and flew back with business class. Aircraft was clean and tidy but the cabin crew were the stars of the show very attentive and pleasant without being too enthusiastic if you know what I mean. The food was excellent in both in premium economy and business class but business class certainly has the edge with the comfort and privacy. My wife doesn't normally sleep well when travelling in aircraft however the fully reclining seat was a great bonus which allowed her to get a few hours of good sleep. In comparison with other airlines I have travelled with the service that Cathay Pacific provides gives it that little bit extra. We can all say the seats are hard or the food needs a little bit extra but at the end of the day it is the staff who can make or break a journey and for me the staff certainly made it for me.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-27;Flew SIN-HKG-KIX return on A340 B747 and B777 all in Y. Seats on the 340 and 747 were comfortable enough but seat pitch on 777 (regional version) was very tight especially after the person in front of me fully-reclined his seat. Crew on all flights friendly and many smiles. But HKG-SIN 777 flight was a red-eye and they served only a snack box with sandwich and juice box leaving me famished for the 3.5 hours.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-23;EWR-HKG in Premium Economy and HKG-EWR in business (thanks to an unexpected upgrade). Had a great experience in both classes attentive but not too present service new airplanes clean friendly on time good connections in HKG (although I found their inter-connection with their subsidiary Dragonair not optimal) classy. Would definitely fly them again. Premium Economy product was good and definitely worth it on a 16hrs flight. While meals are close to those of economy if not the same the cabin quietness and space are enough to make this worth it. Business class was one of the best I've been in with attentive and not over-present service classy and providing you with the options you need when you want them for a pleasant and relaxing flight. Cathay definitely carried the magic of Hong Kong on their flights. Business class seating and bed is very good roomy and comfortable. A very good experience.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-22;Flew Business/Premium from Perth Australia to LHR and return. Cannot fault the crew on all 4 flights - they were very pleasant and efficient. Food and service in Business was very good and above average in Premium Economy. Ground/check-in staff at LHR very helpful with flight changes. The seats in Premium weren't the most comfortable but there was plenty of legroom which is always a problem for me being quite tall. I'll certainly fly Cathay again especially whilst their fares remain so competitive.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-22;SYD-HKG-CDG return left April 12 return April 19. I flew this same route last June/July and chose to fly CX again. The flight to HK on 330 was very comfortable with excellent food and service. The inflight entertainment was good with a wide variety. I slept a little enjoying the flat bed. The flight to CDG later in the evening was in the small front business cabin. I wanted to try this because everyone raves about the cosier and more private space. I was in 11K. Small cupboards are located right here as well and these were accessed a lot by FA which was distracting and did wake me up several times. Also after dinner was served it is a long wait to breakfast. My only complaint is that the flat bed is much firmer than the 330 and in fact uncomfortable and difficult to sleep on at times. On the return flight from CDG-LHR I was in the main business cabin this time which was in fact quieter. The FAs did disappear for sometime and often were engaging in conversations in the galley and less interested in checking on PAX during the flight. When I requested a snack because it was way past dinner time in terms of Paris time the FA was at first a little put out by my request (a first in my experience flying CX). I also found the inflight entertainment almost identical on all flights and hence found it difficult to find anything to watch. Admittedly it was return flight in one week. The flight from HKG-SYD was very good with probably better service than the Paris legs. The food was good although the dinner was served only half way through the flight and then nothing for the last four-five hours. All flights were punctual and even early at times. It is a good value for money business class ticket especially as their business class is one of the best overall. I would fly CX business again even though not as good as last year.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-22;I've flown for 10 years from Paris to HKG every month at least twice a month. I've seen the service quality whether in economy or business class drastically going down from 2009. The food has become much poorer quantity and quality-wise. The temperature in cabin was very cold and most of the time no more blankets left even for my 9 year old daughter. The online booking does not show you complete routes when booking a ticket. Example: HK to Singapore they don't mention there is a stop in Bangkok. So you just get the surprise at check-in. If you want to upgrade from your miles you need to buy a more expansive ticket and even then you are not sure you can be upgraded. Even as a frequent flyer of this company it became almost impossible to book a front row seat over the years. Before as a Marco Polo gold member I could easily get any seat I required. Will never will fly with them again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-21;We flew BKK-HKG-NRT. The BKK-HKG route was on a A330-300 with the new seating product. We were on CX524 flight departed on-time. About an hour after take-off crew started serving meals. There were 2 meal choices and there were plenty of meals for all passengers. Flight landed before schedule which was excellent. Had a 5 hr layover at HKG. Flight to NRT left approximately 30 minutes late but landed 2 minutes before schedule. Meal service on board was a snack meal. Drinks offered upon request. Crew were friendly and always smiling.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-21;Our group flew CX650 on 9 Apr 2014 and returned CX715 on 15 Apr 2014. Both sectors the in-flight service was good and cabin crew served with smile. The economy class seat is comfortable. The breakfast meal of scrambled egg was flat while the dinner meal of chicken curry was delicious. Overall enjoyed my CX flight and will recommend this airline.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-17;Ruined the end of our holiday. We returned Premium Economy from New Zealand - shared flight with ANZ (incidentally ANZ were superb) - what a waste of money - service worse than in ordinary economy. Ran out of meal choice then offered from the (cheaper) economy menu entertainment console / light and call system all broken! On way out offered medical assistance when call went out - given bottle of water as thanks!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-15;HKG to Taipei economy. Flight was on time smooth good boarding and service efficient cabin staff and the service director came down to cattle class which was a nice touch. Very old seats but comfortable. AVOD screens small and dark hard to see the picture. The 'catering' was an all time low for CX. Dry rice box with mushroom? No taste whatsoever and a cold oolong tea carton. Wine and water on request though. I know it's a 1 hr 20 flight was the offering from their 'Mouth-watering' menu was very poor. Eat before you board!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-13;Sydney - Hong Kong vv with airbus 330 economy. Inflight service alright. Food very small the main portion was less than 300 ml in capacity. A bit meagre when compared with Qantas meals. Flight attendants very courteous. Seat in front of toilet so didn't disturb anyone when seat reclined. On the return flight congee served which suited the cultural background of most passengers. A choice of 3 meals didn't run out of choice. Sat next to toilet again toilet door didn't shut properly so ended up closing door for passengers most of the time. No 2nd offer of drinks unless on request. This is below par compared with SQ in which each drink is offered twice. Overall a satisfactory product.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-13;SGN-NRT and OSA-SN. Economy class. Having previously flew CX I was quite confident in the quality of the carrier. Nevertheless these last experiences came as a disappointment. For short/medium haul flights it seems that CX has definitely opted for the low cost low quality approach of the business. Between SGN to HKG the service was indifferent at best. Pax did not even receive a tray with the so called meal but simply a sort of hard paper food box. Drinks choice on offer were limited but large choice on request. I was not proposed any coffee or tea. To sum-up disappointing experience despite the fact that we always flew on time on this trip.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-13;I was very impressed with their new business class flying to Chicago. The crew were nice and the airport was excellent. The only thing that I didn't like is the time it leaves. The flight there takes off at elevenish and flies through the Hong Kong day and when you're about to fall asleep you land. I then had a connection to Boston on American and it was very hard to continue on as you're so tired.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-08;Flew on the new route from Doha to Hong Kong (CX640). A very smooth and comfortable night flight of only just over 7 hours. The flat bed on this newly refurbished A330 was reasonably wide and there was plenty of space for hand luggage. Food was good and service was excellent. Only complaint was not with CX but with the Qatar Airport - on both my inbound and outbound flights the aircraft was requested to park miles and miles away from the terminal and the airport bus took well over 20 minutes to transport passengers to and from the aircraft.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-07;Flew from Shanghai to Auckland in February. 777 to HK then A34O to Akl. The A34O used to Auckland has the new seat layout which is the same seat configuration as the 777-300 and is quite comfortable. Bigger screens and better overall than the older 340 used on the route before. Took off on time and arrived a little early. Food and service always very good. The planes are clean and the crew outstanding. Return flights both on time with the same great service.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-06;I flew from LHR-CDG and CDG-HKG with BA and CX respectively it was excellent as CX managed to upgrade me from a normal Y to Y+ on the Paris-Hong Kong. It was my first time in PE and it made quite a difference since it was a 11 hour flight. There was a significant amount of legroom and the amenity kits and enhanced levels of service made the great difference in price between Y and Y+ that I should now consider in the future when it's a long haul flight. The movies were decent and varied and the cabin crew were flawless one thing that is particularly commendable as they really collaborated together and you felt that they were helping each other out as a team.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-06;I have flown with Cathay many times before but always in Economy or Premium Economy. This was the first time that I have travelled Business Class with them. The flight was Hong Kong to Melbourne return and was on a newly fitted out A330 with the new style Business Class configuration (not the old style herring bone). Overall I was extremely impressed. The service food drink selection and entertainment were all excellent. However the best part of the flight was the seat which was probably the most comfortable business class seat that I have experienced plus there was ample storage space and compartments. The only thing to be aware of is that some seats are not exactly aligned with the window and so you have to crane your neck around the cubicle wall to see out of the window.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-06;"LHR-HKG-NRT and HND-HKG-LHR in Economy. I discovered that by travelling CX I could have a stopover at HKG on my trip to Tokyo at no extra cost to flying direct. 3 of the 4 flights were slightly delayed by no shows but we arrived on time or only a few minutes late in all cases. Overall the flights were very good with above average catering and comfortable seats. Cabin crew were excellent and were available throughout the flight. I would make a couple of comments. It would be nice if Cathay could fit ""ears"" to their economy class seats - it helps avoid getting a pain in the neck. Also it would be good to fit adjustable air vents above each seat. I found the first flight too hot when I got on the cold during the flight (although that was fixed by a trip to the loo to put my vest back on) - adjustable vents would help alleviate this. Notwithstanding these comments I'm happy to award Cathay top marks.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-06;Very nice and good service with many channels available but I don't like the old aircraft's such as the A330-300 and the Boeing 772 because of the old seats and old TV sets. Everything else is ok meals are good bathrooms are clean and staff are friendly.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-02;CDG-HKG-SYD. My wife and I chose PE Economy because of the seat and we were not disappointed. A few extra inches in width and quite a few extra for legs with extra recline and a wide armrest with food tray inside. This all made a dramatic difference for our comfort on a 22 hour flight. It was possible to find a sleeping position. Also at meal times the seat in front did not interfere with the food table. Cabin staff were very friendly and professional a very solid product I would choose again. Try and get the front row seats they have extra leg support.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-02;CX918 B77W MNL-HKG. I am not a regular user of CX but past recent experiences in their new Business Class have been good. The seat is excellent and the catering satisfactory. On this flight I was told that I was being upgraded to First Class but was then advised that there would be no First Class service just the seat and that the catering would be Business Class standard. Having selected a Business Class window seat as always in the CX type of lay-out I was allocated seat 1D in First Class. This is a single centre seat in CX’s apparently new First Class lay-out and can only be described as a cell. Its certainly spacious as you would expect in First Class nowadays but there is a feeling of being locked in to a high sided enclosure. The seat itself is like a bench its width would adequately seat two people and has no shape to it. Also there are no overhead bins only a small cupboard that forms part of the cell which is only large enough to take a small bag and a jacket. Roller bags have to be placed on the floor protruding out from underneath the foot-stool that forms part of the flat bed. It was sufficiently depressing that I asked for my Business Class seat back but the flight was full hence the “upgrade” and my seat had been allocated to someone else. The Business Class catering dinner on this flight – comprised an adequate fruit salad a main course where a choice of two meat in a sauce and rice and fish in a sauce and rice were offered up on a tray by the cabin attendant. They looked so unappetizing that I passed on the main course. Dessert was a dry looking piece of cake which I passed on as well. This was low standard Business Class catering at its worst there was no menu given so the actual content of the meal was down to guess-work. Finally we were told whilst in the Lounge that there were problems with the IFE on board. We then departed almost 2 hours late. Overall very disappointing and in comparable with other carriers in the Region.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-04-01;HKG-LAX. Upgraded on miles to b-class. Great product all round - service plenty of privacy seat comfort and lie flat bed very comfortable making for a decent amount of sleep. Only complaint on this 12hr flight was the meal service timing and slight delay in drinks after take-off. Around 3hrs in dinner was served (which was excellent with a great selection of wines) and then followed around 5hrs later with brunch - some 4hrs out from the destination. It was explained this was in response to some customers providing feedback they got hungry. Odd as CX offer decent inflight snacks and also at odds with other 12hr flights. The service interrupted my sleep and whilst I asked for my brunch to be served 2 hours later and this was done some parts of the brunch offering were missed.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-31;Had a very safe flight from LHR to Hong Kong to Cebu and back. The overall flight made it quite worthwhile at the same time entertaining. Will book my next flight here and highly recommended to all first time travellers.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-28;SFO-HKG-MAA BLR-HKG-SFO (BLR-HKG on Dragonair) in early March. Enough has been said about the horrible shell seats on the 747-400s. One can only hope they replace these aircraft soon. Once again the special Indian vegetarian meal out of SFO was terrible. I have traveled this route 4 times over the past four years and the same entree has been served. I wrote to the airline about this but obviously to no avail. Food-wise things do generally improve on the other legs but in general the quality is going down. AVOD was superb with great sound and picture quality. The selection was vast with all the 2013 best picture Oscar nominated films already available. Overall good value for money with decent on board service and on time flights.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-26;CX have not disappointed me in 3 years of flying. Perhaps as a recognized traveler I get special treatment but never witnessed such with any other airlines. Point in case on recent JFK-HKG flight. I arrived on a late AA connection and had not checked my baggage through to HKG (only checked to JFK). Fearing I would miss my CX connection I did not bother to pick up my luggage at AA baggage claim and went straight to CX barely making the flight. Arriving in HKG I contacted CX baggage services. Even though my bag was not under their control not tagged for them they sent their JFK staff to AA baggage retrieved my bag put it on the next CX JFK-HKG flight and delivered it to my home. All in;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-26;CX881 LAX-HKG in Premium Economy. After a number of recent flights on US airlines it was a real pleasure to step on board a Cathay Pacific plane. The PE product is great for the long haul and worth the extra investment. Far superior to BA's equivalent. Only downside is getting out of your seat if you are at the window (or center) when the seats in front are reclined - makes for a difficult clamber over the person in the next seat. Great service - friendly sincere and efficient. The separate compartment on the 777 is a plus especially when sat on the right side making for easy access to the dedicated washroom.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-24;CX828 HKG-YYZ business class seat 16K. Bravo CX. Puts the US carriers to shame. Got onboard and realized I was seated adjacent to a mother and her 3 young daughters in the second small cabin of business class and imagined there was going to be a lot of family chit-chatting so asked the purser if there was a window seat in the first larger business cabin available. She found a family member of a CX staff travelling on a pass and asked her to switch seats with me. I then used the lavatory and returned to my seat with a wad of tissue. This was noted by a flight attendant who arrived at my seat with an entire box of tissue for my use throughout the flight. That was thoughtful. Food was excellent particularly the hamburger from the mid-flight snack menu. I asked to have the first meal served 'express' with everything (appetizer entree dessert etc) on the tray delivered asap after take-off as I was really tired and wanted to just eat fast and sleep. This was no problem and done as requested. Seat comfort good - lots of storage space. Selection of movies and very good. Flight on time. Flight attendants couldn't have been nicer - polite obliging. No snarling and snappy quips like on United. Overall excellent business class product.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-17;"TPE-NRT. I was looking forward to flying with a much-recommended airline for the first time. Kind of a ho-hum experience. Nothing special really. Limited entertainment. Food middling. Beverage selection awful. I finally asked the attendant if they had anything other than oolong tea or sugary drinks. She looked at me and said ""That is a very good question."" It took her several minutes to track down a single can of Perrier. Overall okay since it was just a short flight but certainly not living up to the hype that surrounds this airline and not an airline I would seek out again.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-13;Traveled from LAX-HKG-KUL and return. I have done this trip twice in the last 4 years with my wife and 3 kids all under 5 years of age. This is the best airlines I have ever been on. I would never travel anywhere long distance to East Asia any other way.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-13;LAX-HKG. I've flown this route many times and they've spoiled me. It took a recent business class trip (LAX-PVG) on their One World sister AA to remind me just how top notch CX is. The product and service are the best. Excellent entertainment food seat is beyond 1st class for many other airlines. Polite attentive professional service. Rare. Service like this is becoming a lost art in many places.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-11;Hong Kong - Manila. Bumped the 4 of us from economy to Premium Economy since economy was overbooked. Seat was spacious and very comfortable (comparable to the business class seat of PR A320 business class seat). Food was okay (sandwich only since it's a 2 hour flight). Plane was a B777-300er. Transfer is a breeze. Inflight entertainment is very good (ranges from classical music to newest movies and concerts are also present including TV shows). CX is a benchmark of great airline service. Will definitely fly them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-10;Melbourne to HK then HK to Rome and return. The MEL-HKG leg was okay again minimal services. The entertainment choices however were excellent. I have learnt from many other long haul flights and now take a soft full size pillow rolled up it makes the world of difference. They are pretty lenient with carry ons I feel the luggage limit of 20kg was a little lousy compared to other carriers. The meal was pretty normal airline food. The flight however was on time and our luggage got there safely. However the HKG - Rome leg was the horrible shell seats. Almost no padding. FA's were really very nice. I spoke to one about the seats and she said they use the old planes to Rome as there are facilities for the staff to sleep and that they use the newer planes for the Melbourne leg. On the return leg we were given a few little packs of cookies. On our trip from Rome to HK we found for some unknown reason our pre-selected seats were changed and my husband and I were apart. We asked about this and they fixed at the check in desk. However onboard someone else had a boarding pass for one of our seats so staff had to quickly find her a seat somewhere. All in all it was a negative experience.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-06;Food was very good but left for hours without being offered any drinks or snacks. Usually fly with Singapore Airlines who are far superior. Expected a similar service. No hot towels provided no toothbrush and paste or flight socks. One meal and drink soon after take off then nothing for 10 hours.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-05;Hong Kong to London Heathrow 27th Feb CX257. A 12 hr fight two rows apart because single people are allowed to take the window and aisle seats leaving only single centre seats. Not everyone can book online - we can't. Young children screaming and crying - can't all young children be sat in one area? The TV didn't work for the whole journey - I told the hostess but she never came back about it. Worst flight and it had to be the long one.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-04;"We flew on CX250 on 28/2. Check in at LHR was bad as the business class desk was not obvious and we were ordered to use the kiosk. This spat out our lounge pass which confused the lady who realised that we were novices and was trying to be helpful. Eventually all the paperwork was sorted and the cases sent on their way. The lounge was comfortable boarding straightforward and we found our seats. Initially it looked good but no one ""showed"" us round so we did not discover a locker in which the headset was stowed and within which was hidden the socket to plug them in. The IFE was better than the listings for classical the music indicated but the audio books appeared to be very limited. dinner drink was offered to one of us but not the other. Dinner was a disappointment - smallish portions minimal garnishing and the advertised pork was substituted by chicken. The bed was clever but this meant that in the day position there was no support for the lower legs. No pillow or mattress the lack of the former forced my wife to use her blanket as a pillow so she was cold. Breakfast was dire although the cups of tea were better than average. The crepe was a soggy scrambled egg. The flight attendants were not alert and failed to realise visual handicap something that needs to be added to their training. Disembarkation was smooth and our bags arrived on the carousel very quickly.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-04;"ICN-HKG-SYD BNE-HKG-ICN in Y class. Departed Feb returned early March. All flights on time with excellent service. All flights on A330-300 aircraft. The first ICN-HKG flight was on an A330 yet to receive the updated economy cabin no different from my inter-Asia flights back in 2012. Loop channel entertainment however still good movies and these are being phased out. All my other flights (2 long haul and the HKG-ICN sector) were with updated cabins. I'm 6'1"" so of course it was a bit tight but comfy compared to most economy products and I managed a good sleep on the BNE-HKG sector. Entertainment was amazing! Large touchscreen TVs that were a joy to use. Food was also good on all sectors and the gin and tonics I had were very tasty with just the right strength. All in all highly recommended!";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-03;HKG-TPE-HKG my first time on CX but if these 2 flights are the norm then it won't be my last CX406 and CX405 on a 773 and returning on an A330. Check in both at HK Central and TPE quick and polite the lounges both in HK and TPE very good too. The flights for a flight of 1hr 30min where fantastic they really put the US and European airlines regional business class to shame the seats were great the new type out and the old type back. The crew again very friendly and really on top of their game then the food I don't bother that much with airline food but this again was pretty good. Great trip and I will be looking to use CX again soon on there long haul product.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-03-03;CX170 and CX888 PER-HKG-YVR on A330 and 777ER. Firstly Qantas lounge at Perth is ordinary but did the job for an hour. Trip from PER to HKG was quite good with food okay service friendly & seat being comfortable. HKG to YVR was excellent all round again and slept 7 of the 11 hours. Overall very good but find that the 777ER is significantly more spacious and comfortable seat then the A330 (due to cabin width). I would also recommend getting an extra duvet or 2 (you get 1 initially) as these are quite thick and can be used as a type of mattress when sleeping it really made the world of difference on the 2nd leg for me.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-18;Flight CX256 (LHR to HKG) on 14th. There was a delay in takeoff from Heathrow due to strong winds causing us to wait onboard the plane for 30 minutes but the pilot kept us well informed of the situation. Although this flight wasn't as perfect as my last flight (CX233) possibly because it was a full flight the crew were attentive and helpful. The meals weren't as good as last time (no chocolates or Haagen Dazs) but it was still edible (with Chinese spicy chicken and congee) and above what you would typically expect in economy. The thing I most like about the seat was the compartment in which you were able to put your phone in.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-18;Flew SYD-HKG-PEK in December on time no delay and back to SYD on February which was delayed by 30 minutes. Food was good. Seat comfortable and inflight entertainment was ok.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-18;HKG-MXP (CX233). The plane was only 70% full nevertheless the crew did an excellent job for the 12.30 flight. The level of attention and service for economy is astounding considering that they offered Godiva chocolates and Haggen Dazs ice cream. The IFE was superb with touch screen being very responsive.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-17;"CX880 HKG-LAX 15 Feb 2014 First Class Seat 1A 777. Fantastic service started with FA's personally greeting me and introducing themselves indicative of the personal level of service that prevailed. Only 3 of 6 seats occupied in first and the other 2 pax slept most of the time. Excellent food caviar a very large steak (I ate less than 1/2) Haagen Das ice cream. Spacious seat comfy for sleeping even without the mattress. Didn't even watch the IFE just caught up on reading. 1A/2A more private than the ""K"" side.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-17;Flew in Business from Brisbane to Hong Kong and return. Check-in both ways was efficient and friendly. Qantas business lounge in Brisbane was not very good with limited selection of food and unfortunately did not have a chance to sample CX's many lounges in HK. On board the flight staff were friendly and efficient - especially the customer service managers on both flights. Service from other staff varied and whilst efficient some were not very proactive (though this is a very minor complaint). Food was of excellent quality and portions plentiful. I particularly liked the Cathay signature drinks offered on the menu. The business seat is fantastic and well appointed. IFE was good however the movie selections were a little limited for my preferences.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-10;CX708 and CX709 17-19 Jan 2014. My friend and I booked our flight specifically with confirmation that we would have flown with the new business class seat on Boeing 747. Upon check in we were told that we were to fly on an Airbus 330. We boarded the plane and I was in shock. The seats were exactly the same as 10 years ago but older due to aging. The seats were old and ugly with a width of other '5-star' airlines premium economy class and recline of their economy! Lights were flickering during take off. My seat was broken and could not upright to 90 degrees for take off and landing. I was told at least 3 times by a steward to adjust my seat upright before he accepted the fact that my seat was broken. I was not offered another seat as the flight was fully booked. Personal TV screen was even smaller than my Samsung Galaxy phone with broken green and flickering display. When I tried to ask if there was power socket to charge my phone I was told that there wasn't one available! I tried to sleep but I could not because the seat was so uncomfortable with almost economy class recline. Instead of flying a bigger newer plane to replace reduced flight they decided to fly the oldest of the oldest. We were greeted with at least 5 idle Boeing 747 upon our arrival in Hong Kong. My flight back was the same plane type with the same discomfort but with a worse selection of food. The flight was not the cheapest but the most uncomfortable of all the choices I have.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-10;HKG-KUL - one way. My wife and I are touring the Far East and this one way trip of 4 hours with CP was very good indeed. The plane was newish and the seats as good as International BA Club World. Its sort of odd in the recline as the whole thing seems to go up - vertically. But very comfortable when you get the hang of it. Food very tasty - had smoked salmon and Asian Chicken followed by fruit. All good. Drinks all chilled. FAs on the mark - friendly and efficient. Was it worth the £1000 each - actually I thought it was. The lounge was a odd experience - good food and booze etc - but weird plastic seats and tables that looked like a local HK bog standard eating house. All in all though a good flight and I would recommend the airline.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-07;Recently flew from Okinawa Japan to Sydney Australia round-trip (used Dragon Air to go from Hong Kong and Okinawa). One recommendation is try to avoid flying during the Chinese New Year which is very busy we flew January 19th and return flight was Feb. 4th and both flights were full. Our return flight was on a Tuesday (from Sydney to Hong Kong) and was absolutely chaotic and full. I found the Flight Attendants to be very helpful and extremely nice (compared to US Carriers). Our 2 yo daughter was screaming/crying and they were very attentive. Tried to upgrade to Economy Plus but not available. Economy is not going to be comfortable on any airline you choose (9 hr flight from Hong Kong to Sydney). Plan on little to no sleep on if in Economy with the seating. Most flights are red eyes to and from Hong Kong and Sydney. Food was ok and they do feed you no matter the time. We were annoyed as we flew back from Sydney as they fed us at 11pm we were hoping they would darken the cabin to help our daughter sleep no such luck. Inflight entertainment system was great. I would recommend Cathay Pacific but try to upgrade to Premium Economy if you can and again avoid flying 2 weeks before and after Chinese New Year if going through Hong Kong because it will be busy!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-07;Myself and my wife visit Melbourne Australia to see our children almost every 2 years. We by choice travel Singapore Airlines. This time for a change we travelled Cathay Pacifc from Kolkata India via Hong Kong. We boarded flight CX 105 scheduled on 19th Dec 2013 which actually took off from Hong Kong in the early hours of 20th Dec 2013. When dinner was served my wife asked for an extra bun. She was told that there was no extra bun available. I asked for red wine when I was waiting for a second serving by the time the hostess came to me after serving others seated ahead of me she poured into my glass whatever little left in bottle and said sorry!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-05;CX549 HND-HKG booked in Premium Economy class upgrade to Business Class. Very nice long-haul Business Class seat. I have a single seat window and aisle. Welcome drink nice greeting with meal menu. The food need to improve in Business Class. Taste is worst than before. Cabin Crew are friendly. Once again the flight arrived 20mins early into HKG.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-05;KUL-HKG. Found things pleasant. New plane with responsive staff. Used FF so paid a small fee to cover taxes.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-05;JFK-HKG. Took the same flight last year. Newer plane with acceptable seat. Flight 99% full. Biggest issue is timing of meals. Flight left at 2pm first meal started before 4pm and second/last meal at 10pm. No further meals for next 8 hours. some snack available but not enough to keep the belly occupied. Will not fly this flight again. Return flight was more standard with both meals spaced properly.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-05;Business Class LHR to AKL. LHR to Hong Kong leg was with Cathay and the HK to AKL leg provided by Air NZ as code share. On the whole Cathay was superior with the exception of the food which was excellent on Air NZ. Cathay business class seating provided excellent space and storage and the configuration 1x2x1 with each seat angled away from the aisle ensured privacy. This contrasted with Air NZ which had less storage and not as much privacy as seats have lower screens and are angled towards each other. The Air NZ lie flat bed with mattress was comfortable but requiring the crew to make up the bed was an irritation. The inflight entertainment was far superior on Cathay Pacific. The Air NZ controls were very dated and the screen was small compared to other airlines. Overall service from flight crew was very good with both airlines. Disappointing that a lounge pass was not provided at check-in because of the codeshare status and I was instructed to use the Air NZ lounge at Hong Kong but on arrival discovered Air NZ shares the Thai lounge which was disappointing to say the least. Codeshare also meant that I couldn't check in on line for the non Cathay legs. I chose the code share flight combination as it offered the opportunity to experience two different business class services. Next time I would select flights only from Cathay pacific as Air NZ was disappointing. I understand that the Hong Kong to AKL route is provided by older fleet and it felt like it.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-03;We travelled on Business Class from Singapore to Colombo. Tickets were booked on expedia. There were some confusion over the name on the boarding pass and passport. Staff at check-in assured us that it had been changed after an argument but found out that it had not. Departure from Singapore was delayed an hour. Now departure from Colombo has also been delayed for an hour. Staff at check-in should be less surly. The airline should maintain a level of punctuality.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-02-03;"Cathay's cabins on regional flights were in need of a re-do and a clean up. Cathay has rolled out a new ""regional business class"" seat that has partially addressed the upgrade but has totally ignored passenger comfort in the seat. First the seat is hard. On a short sector Manila/Hong Kong I found the seat uncomfortably hard and actually found my back aching. How can they have padded the seat so sparsely? Secondly the seat does offer some recline and an opportunity to snooze although not quite enough especially if one is tall. I'm short 5'8"" and my feet were bumping the apparatus in front of me that housed the next seats. Truly 2"" more of leg room would have been very good and one wonders why Cathay made the pitch so tight. Thirdly the seat has no foot rest - a true failing. How did this happen? In all Cathay's service is good and attentive but the seat in the new regional business class needs a respectable amount of padding 2"" more pitch and a place to rest one's feet when reclined!";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-30;Flew SYD-HKG on a codeshare so didn't pay CX prices but this was by far the best carrier of the trip. Staff are attentive and pleasant nothing is too much trouble for them and seat (A330) was very comfortable. If I could afford it I'd definitely fly the whole trip to NZ and back with Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-29;CX548 HKG-HND Premium Economy. This is a 777-300ER. I like this aircraft because it has a separate washroom in the Premium Economy Cabin. This is the second time that I have taken Premium Economy from HKG to HND. On ground welcome drink is nice. Food is ok but it can improve a bit. Cabin crews are nice and friendly. As usually Cathay Pacific flights on-time. If they add a mid-night flight from HKG to HND will be better just like CX524 HKG-NRT.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-28;YVR-JFK round trip. This flight is a bit weird because it carries passengers from HKG to JFK via YVR. It collects some passengers from YVR to JFK. Captain greeted passengers with weather and flight information. Flight to JFK was full but flight crew served drinks and food together then with another round of drinks before shutting off the lights to let people sleep. An hour before landing flight crew walked the aisles with water jugs to serve water. On the way back from JFK to YVR the flight was only a third full. Check-in staff gave me a full row to myself. My phone charger broke so I asked for one and the FA gave me her personal charger. The 777 has touch screen entertainment with USB access massive collection of movies and TV shows. Good airline overall the HKG-YVR-JFK route however is mostly going to be a red eye flight the return flight was less stressful.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-28;HKG-TPE. I have travelled several times with Cathay Pacific and I am always very impressed with their service. On my return flight I arrived early at the airport. At the check-in they told me that my flight was slightly delayed. Because they feared that I might miss my connection to Europe in Hong Kong they automatically rebooked me on the flight one hour earlier very professional! The flight experience itself was as always impeccable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-28;I have travelled Cathay Pacific in the past and enjoyed the experience but have to say my last two flights from Perth to Hong Kong then Hong Kong to Tokyo Haneda were very average. The plane was looking old (in economy noted that first class and business looked like they had been renovated). My entertainment system did not work on the first flight. Rarely have I found an airline meal so bad I would not eat it but the Hake was disgusting and the scrambled eggs the next morning also awful. On the first flight the cabin crew were abrupt I realise it was a full flight but I still expect pleasantness. The service was minimal and seemed rushed and a bit sloppy. I thought it might have been just me but when I caught up with my husband and son who had flown the same route two days earlier we laughed because they too had exactly the same experience. I'm hoping to enjoy my return trip in a weeks time more.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-25;CX270 AMS-HKG and CX767 HKG-SGN. Flight from Amsterdam in an A340 had the old herringbone Business Class seats - I actually really liked having my own private 'pod'. The cabin crew were some of the friendliest courteous and most genuine I have ever been served by in the sky - nothing was a problem to them. The inflight food was beautifully presented and cooked. I admit being 6ft 5ins tall the flat bed is too short to lie flat but even though I wish they designed seats for taller people it is still possible to get some sleep. Their lounges at Hong Kong Airport are outstanding - there are 6 of them! The flight to Ho Chi Minh City was on an A330 with the old regional seating not the new 777 with new business class seating (aircraft change) but still the serene comfortable professional service and great food. I'm not surprised that Cathay Pacific is a 5-Star airline - other airlines like BA could learn so much from them. An absolutely brilliant experience!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-23;CX807 March 24 2013 and CX 709 March 25 2013. I have never experienced a more enjoyable travel experience. Cathay is truly on their game and puts other top airlines to shame. I felt at home and cared for which made for a great trip.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-22;HKG-KUL. The plane is embarrassingly old. My seat was broken as was the entertainment system. The flight attendants do their best but the airline really leaves them high and dry with the product they are putting up. It happened that my schedule was such that I returned to HK on Malaysian Airlines (a code share with Cathay) and that was much better. The Malaysian Airlines staff were excellent the plane was new and it all worked very nicely. Cathay's best days appear to be well behind them.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-20;"HKG-LAX B77W First Class. Transferred from a regional CX flight and was met at the arrival gate and escorted to a special transfer line for expedited security checking. The Wing First Class Lounge is excellent with attentive staff service good food/beverages and outstanding Cabanas. A second security check of hand luggage prior to boarding but the boarding lines could be better organized. On time departure. Four passengers in a cabin for six. The ""pre-refreshed"" interior (which I prefer to the latest colors) was well-preserved and clean. Staff friendly but lacked the standard of finesse expected on CX First Class especially when there were only four passengers. The hand-written welcome note on my tray was for another passenger until I pointed out their error. One flight attendant was very young and inexperienced and was unfamiliar with the wine choices available on the flight. The food served is of good quality and tasty but the menu is rather limited with main entrees that are not as good as served a couple of years ago. The AVOD system is outstanding and the seat very specious and private but not very comfortable for sitting in for 14+ hours though excellent for sleeping in the lie-flat position. On-time arrival at LAX but baggage took longer than expected for delivery. Overall I like the CX First Class product very much though I am concerned that standards are slipping slightly especially when some Asian and Middle East competitors are improving their product.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-20;CX161 HKG-SYD Business Class. Excellent seat. Flight 20 mins early arrived. Check-in was smooth. On ground welcome drink and hot towel. Food was great. During 2 meals services CX provide snack and noodle as well. AVOD with touch screen. Headsets was comfortable. Each seat is single seat and flat bed. Cabin crew did a very nice work. I strongly recommend to take Cathay Pacific Airways even you are book economy class.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-20;SYD-HKG-NRT. Boarding was very efficient on both flights. The service was attentive efficient and pleasant on both flights. The SYD-HKG flight was serviced by an A330 with the new economy class seats. The new seats were very comfortable with good legroom and plenty of storage space. Two full sized meals were served on this flight - the first was quite average but the second was delicious. The HKG-NRT flight was serviced by a B773 with the old economy class seats. These seats were not the most comfortable but thankfully I had three to stretch out over. I found the IFE system Studio CX a little harder than average to use at first but the range of entertainment options was outstanding. Overall good value for money a high quality new economy class and outstanding service will see me coming back to CX.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-20;London Heathrow to Hong Kong and back economy both ways. Flew on the last 747 service from London to Hong Kong on 31st December 2013. We were all given a lovely commemorative postcard set at the gate. As we taxied a firetruck water canon salute was in operation although the fact that it was pouring with rain rather spoiled the effect! Seats were reasonably comfortable and although I know others find these older style 'sliding' recline Cathay Pacific seats not so comfortable at least you don't get problems with the person in front if you reclining their seat all the way back. Food was nothing special neither was the movie selection and crew not the most attentive I was expecting Cathay Pacific in-flight service to be up there with the other major Asian airlines and so was a little disappointed. Return flight Hong Kong to Heathrow was on a 777. It may be my 'shape' but I just could not get comfortable in these seats (economy class) and unlike the old style 747 seats the new 777 seats recline by tilting and so inevitably the person in front of me decided to recline fully for the entire flight. This combined with the uncomfortable seat (no lumbar support and either very low armrests or high seat cushion - I couldn't work out which) made it one of the most unpleasant long haul flights I have taken in recent years. Cabin crew not friendly (aside from one female cabin attendant who seemed to be doing more work than all her colleagues and who was genuinely personable and friendly) and as on the outward leg cabin crew not especially attentive. Very relieved to land at LHR and get off this flight. Disappointed with Cathay Pacific given their generally very positive reputation.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-20;CX100 SYD-HKG in Premium Economy class. On ground welcome drink and hot towel. I took the first row window seat and it was nice that next to my seat was empty. The meal was great not worse than Business Class. Inflight snack you can choose noodles chips biscuit or apple. One thing is not good enough in PEY cabin is that they do not have a restroom on Airbus A330-300. The 773-300ER has one restroom. I am glad that they still provide Business class headsets in PEY cabin. It helps reduce engine sound. The seat was just like regional Business seats. Flight arrived 35 mins early.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-17;HKG-SIN-HKG. The outbound flight (CX739) was a 77W which is equipped with the latest long-haul seats. Seat was comfortable and the AVOD was working properly. However I was disappointed with the meal portion and the service. Requested a cup of hot tea for 3 times to 3 different crew members but still also unattended. Finally I went to the gallery to ask for a cup of tea. The return flight (CX714) was a retrofitted regional A330 (B-HLT). The service was much better. The crew was friendly and was very willing to assist me with the luggage. Water service was offered throughout the whole red-eye flight. A thumb up to the team. Overall the service standard was dropped and Cathay please listen up and improve!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-17;Flew from Perth to HK and return in November 2013. The 9hr flight was very smooth and quiet the service on board faultless food was first rate and the seat in Business Class was very comfortable to sleep in. One can only imagine what it would be like to fly in First Class! Granted Cathay Pacific are not cheap to fly with but if you can afford to spoil yourself and upgrade to Business Class on Cathay you will not be dissapointed. Hopefully I get to fly with them again some time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-15;CX888 HKG-YVR-JFK. Great service with good taste meal. Also inflight entertainment was great. Lots of movies and music.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-14;CX170 9 Dec 2013. CX826 12 Dec 2013. CX829 6 Jan 2014. CX171 7 Jan 2014. Very disappointed with meal service and menu choices. From the 4 flights we took and only 32 seats in Premium Economy we could not get our choice of main meal 3 times out of the 4. Breakfast also had very limited choices. Some of the main meals seem to be served at strange times. Not enough toilets no separate toilets for Premium Economy on the aircraft we traveled on. Seats are comfortable and staff polite.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-14;HKG-SIN. To be honest I expected more from this airline. Aircraft was a very old and tired A330. IFE with small screens and very limited selection. Food and beverage average but not more. Cabin crew indifferent.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-13;Flew from London to Hong Kong then onto Cebu flying with B777 and A340. Arrived at Heathrow a tad early and was checking in first class as there was nobody at business check in. The man behind the check-in was a delight. I proceed to the lounge and staff made a fuss of me. The check in staff member came over and said he would escort me to the plane and allow me to board my seat first. Flight delayed 40 minutes but the cabin crew had served champagne and after take off dinner was served. I only watched one film as I was managed to sleep for 7 hours. Breakfast was great. Connecting flight to Cebu on an A340 and it was interesting to be seated in the old style funeral type business seat I can see why most hated it but I am not bothered as it was only a 2.5 hour flight. On arrival a Cathay Pacific staff member was waiting for me and quickly escorted me to immigration - from the moment I got off the plane through to immigration luggage and customs it took 6 minutes. My return trip this year after spending Christmas and New Year was on a much newer business class seats and such an improvement. Tried out the new Bridge lounge the staff are a delight again. Boarded first to my seats and the staff recognised me and made sure I was comfortable.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-10;HKG-CMB-HKG (via BKK). B777-300. Business Class Regional Product. Boarding at HKG could be improved and the flight departed 45 minutes late and also landed late in CMB. Service food and beverages very good and the new regional business class seat is a huge improvement in comfort practicality features and style. However it lacks a privacy screen between seats and jumping over the sleeping aisle seat passenger's feet is more difficult due to more legroom under the seat in front. A one hour stop each way in BKK where passengers to CMB or HKG must remain on board per Thai government regulations. Baggage delivered promptly in CMB. Business Class check-in staff member in CMB was outstanding. The Araliya Lounge that is used by all airlines except Emirates and SriLankan Airlines continues to be a disappointment. Return flight departed CMB on time but was delayed at BKK. Overall CX is a great option in this region though the new seats are not as good as SIA's regional product. CX also has a HKG-CMB-HKG flight via SIN and that's a better route as passengers are allowed to wait in the lounge during the one hour stop.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-09;DME-HKG-DME. Fully satisfied with the flight. Check-in was very efficient staff very professional and polite. No delays both flights arrived actually 15 minutes earlier. Well-balance food on board. Excellent entertainment system with vast selection of movies & music. Great in-flight magazine with lots of useful tips on Hong Kong and interesting articles about other countries. The seats are a little bit funny but when you get used to them they are pretty comfortable indeed. Great value for money and comfort.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-08;NRT-HKG. Departed on time quick boarding arrival on time good service. seat was comfortable and I felt rested by landing.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-08;CX711 HKG-SIN. B777. Unimpressed with boarding procedures. Cathay staff all over the place and did not direct passengers to correct queues especially after call to gate was issued late. Design of Hong Kong Airport doesn't help as queue snaked all the way to the next gate (and thankfully that gate was not open otherwise it would have been a complete mess). Flight departed 20 minutes late. I think Cathay's on ground service at their hub can be so much better if there's better co-ordination between Cathay and HKIA. Anyway once on board the service was much better. Attentive cabin crew served drinks promptly after takeoff and decent early dinner was served one hour into the flight. Seat was good with decent legroom and once again the IFE was also good. Would fly Cathay Pacific in future and hope their service at HKIA can be improved.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-08;CX714 SIN-HKG. Arrived at Changi and found myself pleasantly upgraded to Business Class as Economy Class was full. Service was excellent all round - champagne and juices before take off and supper service was prompt. Aircraft was an A330 with new regional product I believe. The seats were lovely just what you need when your flight departs at 1am but alas could only take forty winks and not a proper night's rest especially during such a short flight. IFV was good and easy to use. Once off the plane bags were swiftly delivered. Good service overall would definitely use Cathay Pacific in future.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-07;KUL to Nagoya via HKG in early Dec on new regional business class. It was an excellent flight on both outbound and return legs. The new regional business class on the A330 is outstanding and almost like a mini-suite. The seats were comfortable IFE excellent and food also very good. This is probably the best business class product around for the Asia region.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-03;I went from Hong Kong to Jakarta. They used an A330 plane with a seat config of 2-4-2. The flight was full. The food served was not good especially for a five-star airline. The plane was supposed to leave the airport at 19.10 but was in the air at 19.45. As we boarded there was an overhead cabin which opened up. 3/4 way to Jakarta one of the toilets went out of service. This was not the service I expected from Cathay Pacific and travelling from Hong Kong! The IFE was not good and the safety tutorial was not clear.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-03;NRT-HKG-SYD very pleased with the service. Food and beverages always come at the best of times. Requested a drink a few times without any trouble. HKG to SYD new A330 with good cabin overall and great leg room although NRT-HKG old 777 with very old in-flight system and minimal leg room. Overall very happy as usual when flying with Cathay. Certainly one of my favourite airlines to fly with.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-02;JFK-HKG-CMB 12/18. We purposely like to fly out of JFK to catch Cathay's afternoon non-stop to HKG vs. flying out of LAX (plus get a couple of nights in NYC). Check-in at JFK is with BA. They don't offer any of the special services you find at JAL FC check-in or AA Flagship (an airline employee walks you counter check-in through Security to the Lounge). Priority TSA is not available at the early afternoon hour. Luckily regular security did not have long lines. Cathay uses the BA FC Lounge which is not special and needs a major refurb. The 777-300 had Cathay's new refreshed FC cabin. The flight is so special it makes up for the mediocre airport experience. The FAs are simply the best. Lunch and dinner meal services on this 16+ hour flight can't be beat. The menu has a wide variety of choices. I had the lamb which was perfectly cooked to my requested preference medium rare. Turn down service PJs (an upgraded PJ very comfortable) and inflight entertainment are the best of the Asian carriers. Simply the best choice to Asia.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-02;"CGK-HKG CX 776 HKG-SFO CX 872. Requests were treated as a big nuisance for the flight attendants. When water was politely requested the FA said ""later I'll come back to you"" but never did. Overall CX failed to represent its status as a five-star airline.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2014-01-02;HKG-NRT very good service plane is quite new good entertainment system and excellent service. Staff are very friendly and the seats have the new shell design so you won't disturb the person behind you.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-30;LAX-HKG / SIN-HKG-LAX - Great flights all around. Wonderful inflight service and all departures were on time. Traveled in Business Class on the B777. The transpacific has lie-flat seats and is the first time in YEARS that I have been able to sleep 6-8 hours. Very comfortable seats with lots of storage space and great selection on the entertainment system.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-29;CX 684 BOM-HKG and CX 685 HKG-BOM. Both flights departed late and landed an hour late. Cabin crew were polite and attentive. Airplane was an old 747 and looked gloomy. They did serve the pre-ordered VLML meal on both legs which is way better than airlines like Thai that take VLML orders on their BOM leg and do not serve them.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-29;CX 418 HKG-Seoul and CX 411 Seoul-HKG. Airplanes looked old with dated video systems. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Pre-ordered VLML meals arrived. Flights were pretty much on time.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-29;"BLR-HKG-PVG Business. Although Cathay is normally a quite good airline the aircraft used for this crowded flight is ridiculous. The business class seat is not the old fashioned big chair nor the nearly horizontal flat bed slide it can only be defined as ""the back cracker"". Honestly a coach seat does the job better on this semi-long haul flight. Service and food is no problem but leaving from BLR at almost 3am (scheduled time) leaves no room for enjoying dining but a sleeping urgency after an overcrowded lousy stay in the BLR poor lounge. Do not take this flight if possible it is one of the worst overall.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-23;LHR-HKG Business Class 12th Nov 2013 - Excellent flight on 777. Food and service perfect. Business lounge at HKG great. HKG-SYD Business Class 13th Nov 2013 - Terrible flight on old A330. Seats stained and cramped compared to 777. Service and food good. SYD-HKG Bus Class 2nd Dec 2013. Same tired old A330 terrible. HKG-LHR Bus Class 3rd Dec 2013. Very old 747 with terrible cramped seats worse than A330. This is the worst Business Class flight I have ever been on - a disgrace. I will not fly Cathay Pacific again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-21;SFO-MAA-SFO. Overall the service seems to be slipping though compared to the competition on this route it still is the best value for money. My wife ordered an Indian veg meal for all legs of the journey. Once again the meal from SFO to HKG was inedible. The same thing happened on an identical itinerary in Feb 2012. Looks like they don't change the special meal menus. The quality improved on the other legs though overall the meal quality (special and regular) has come down. AVOD was fine. The shell seat on the old 747-400 is most uncomfortable though the leg room is fine.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-20;LAX-HKG. B77W. First Class. The aircraft had the newest special dark green paint scheme celebrating Hong Kong. Check-in was good but boarding delayed and not well organized due to late arrival of the aircraft. The much-advertised refurbished First Class cabin is a huge disappointment. The reflection of Chinese heritage through dark stained wood veneer finishes and rich silk-like fabrics have been replaced with very cheap and common-looking grey plastic and light stained wood veneer finishes and ordinary grey fabrics. Perhaps this was a hastily assembled early product for this signature paint scheme aircraft as the fit and finish of most components were very poor and the new seat padding a disappointment on a 15 -hour journey. Cabin service was top-notch from sincerely caring staff. However they could improve in the area of anticipating customers' needs. The meals were well-prepared but the menu offered very few choices and didn't offer more upscale entrees. The beverage selection was excellent with some very good wines on offer. While CX continues to offer an excellent First Class product it needs to up its game in light of recent upscale competitors in Asia and the Middle East. The Wing First Class Lounge at HKG is excellent with attentive staff lovely Cabanas and good food.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-19;CX255 18th Sep 2013 HKG-LHR. The seat was quite comfortable but the personal display looked a little bit cheap. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The meals were very good for in-flight meals. As in all 747s the seat was a bit narrower than the 777 seats. Ground crew was also very helpful offering to print my boarding pass (I had the e-pass on my phone).;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-16;JFK-HKG-SYD in Premium Economy a very long flight with every seat filled JFK-HKG. The aircraft cabin was in excellent condition. The cabin crew were smiling and immaculately groomed which is more than I can say for Qantas with whom I usually travel. I pre-ordered a Lacto Veg meal. I was offered a glass of champagne prior to take-off but when I requested one with the meal service I was told there was none and I could have red or white wine no mention of what it was and it was served in a disposable plastic tumbler. The veg main course was good. The dessert on the tray was fresh pineapple which I cannot eat because of medication I take. When the standard meal ice creams were offered I requested one but was told I couldn't have one as it may not be vegetarian. A second meal was served a few hours later but to my surprise the main course on my tray was exactly the same as the previous one. Cups of noodles were offered once during the long night flight other snacks listed on the menu were not offered but had to be obtained from trays in the galley. If you are seated on the left side of the 777 to get to the lavatory which is on the right side at the front of the Premium Economy Cabin you need to go back through the E/C cabin cross over through the centre galley and then back up to the front and vice versa to get back to your seat. On the HKG-SYD sector I moved seats to enable the person next to me more room as he had to go straight to work on arrival. When breakfast was offered I told the cabin attendant I had moved and that I had ordered a veg meal. I did not want to leave them short a breakfast tray. I was told they that would get my meal. When it arrived what I think was an economy tray was put in front of me on which was a bowl with 5 cubes of melon half a plastic tumbler of apple juice a dry bread roll and a main course which did not appeal. There was no butter no jam no croissant no yoghourt all listed on the Premium Economy menu. In my opinion Cathay Pacific has a long way to catch up with their Premium Economy service.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-12;CX-617 from HKG to BKK. The flight was on time. Seat and Entertainment service were fine. The meal served rather disappointing I had a chicken curry on rice which only filled half the container.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-10;"HKG-ICN - my wife and myself had some difficulty in getting our seats assigned. Initially I thought this is due to our ""ultra competitive fare"" not allowing advance seat reservation but the real reason seemed to be that Cathay made an equipment change from A333 to B773 at very short notice only hours before departure. Thus we did not get the desired twin-seat in the Airbus but a neighbour in the 3-3-3 configuration of the 777. All the rest was ""standard procedure"" in Cathay's five star level. On time departure arrival ahead of schedule well managed inflight service despite a full cabin. Friendly and polite cabin crew but clearly focussed due to the number of pax to be served. AVOD ok but this is not ranking high in my priority list. I prefer a good choice of reading options which I got plus a decent meal and a good beverage selection. This being a morning flight the emphasis was more on tea and coffee - and only later on wine. I got all I needed and am once again really content with Cathay.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-09;"SFO-DXB/SIN-SFO Our first time on CX Premium Economy. Seats are fairly comfortable with decent legroom and an excellent VOD system. Food not much different from that served in Economy and they acted surprised when we requested a cocktail before dinner. The much advertised ""separate check-in and separate boarding lines"" were available in SFO but nowhere else. All in all not a bad experience but they have a long way to go to match the Premium Economy of Air New Zealand and Qantas.";POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-07;Flew CX in Nov 2013 from BKK-SIN and then SIN-HKG a few days later in economy. Both flights were mediocre. Legroom is very lacking. Food very average. FA's however were very good and attentive. I booked these tickets 6 months earlier yet CX arbitrarily changed our seat assignments on the SIN-HKG leg and my wife and I were seated 10 rows apart. No apology no effort to correct their error. Also I had booked and paid for Premium Economy and was told no PE on these legs. Yet the SIN-HKG flight clearly had a PE cabin which was half empty. Not very fair. Both flights did leave and arrive on time. Baggage delivery by CX quite slow in BKK and SIN and HKG.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-07;Flew LAX-HKG return in Nov 2013 in Premium Economy. Good value for money. Seats were reasonably comfortable with adequate leg room. An inflatable seat cushion made my bottom more comfortable. FA's were friendly and attentive. Food was decent for airplane food. A/V was excellent with high quality screens and a huge program menu. Would certainly recommend CX for transpacific trips. Only complaint would be that there are not enough toilets on this 777 aircraft.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-06;HKG-JFK 25 Nov 2013. Business 777-300ER. Very comfortable pods with lie-flat seats that promote comfortable sleeping conditions. Extremely attentive staff anxious to serve. Decent food very good wine and I believe 4 hot towels during the roughly 15 hour flight. Compared to Korean Air's business class on A380 where the entire upper deck is for business the cabin seemed a bit more confined (and frankly comparable to Korean's 777 business class) but a very good experience. Plenty of storage very clean restrooms (frequently serviced during the flight) good video system and excellent headphones. Certainly an expensive alternative to Premium Economy but clearly a step above.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-06;JFK-HKG 17 Nov 2013. Premium Economy on 777-300ER featured not only more legroom and more deeply reclining seats but a wider arm rest between seats resulting in a sense of not crowding the passenger next to me (or vice versa!). Odd that dinner would be served at approximately 2.00 am when all I wanted to do was sleep. All-in-all a pleasant if lengthy trip and because of a small subsection of the cabin reserved for this class it provided a feeling of relative seclusion. Very attentive staff. Avoid bulkhead seats as people walking down the left aisle using restroom on right side of aircraft must walk across the outstretched legs of passenger reclining there.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-05;Flew from Singapore to Taipei via Hong Kong recently. The departing flight was as usual the new 777-300 regional economy class seats are good with touchscreen VOD but not much selection. Not many complains for this leg except for the fact that there is an irritating pack of stuff on the left hand side of the seat belt. For the return flight from Taipei to Singapore I was surprised that they upgraded the plane from an A340 to a 777-300ER. I loved the seats. I was also surprised that they serve a box of food followed by a packet of oolong tea. The VOD selections for this flight is not much only a selection of music and television programs. Flight from Hong Kong to Singapore was a horrible flight. The boarding procedures for economy class were unbearable I was forced to put my carry on luggage 4 rows behind my seat as the flight was fully loaded and people brought lots and lots of shopping bags onboard the flight. Flight CX735 was delayed 50 mins. The flight attendants were very kind and always offered to help passengers.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-04;In recent years I have noticed massive improvements in the service of CX flight ground staff and reservations etc. I now attempt to use HK as my transit point to anywhere Asia. My most frequent route being LHR-HKG-PEN return so that allows me to test both long haul and regional the same time. Long haul depending on which flight the old configuration on the 747-400 is still very comfortable especially when travelling solo but not great when travelling in pairs or if you like looking out the windows. I always like sitting on the upper deck. The new configuration on the 777-300ER are by far the best business class seats I have ever experience. You can have great view outside or in pairs the middle seats allow both privacy or dining together depending what you enjoy. Extremely comfortable travel all round with great food and service. They clearly take service very seriously as majority of flights I have been on with CX I was asked if I would like to do a detailed written survey. It's extensive but something I am always happy to do. It's clear that consistently over the years the scores are moving more and more positive from my point of view. I used to dread the long journeys but now I look forward to them when I know I am travelling Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-04;Flying for the second time this year with Cathay Pacific (Economy) and it's not as good as it used to be before. I was not able to reserve a seat online for my flight from MNL to AMS. I called the HQ in Manila and they advised me to come to the airport on time so I could reserve my seat (I wanted to upgrade to premium or business). Arriving at Manila International I found out that I was not able to upgrade in any way. From Manila to Hong Kong the flight was ok we had a new airplane and the seats were comfortable. Though we only got a cheap snack even though our flight was at 8pm and people were hungry. From Hong Kong to Amsterdam the flight was delayed and we had to move from Gate 69 to Gate 31. Finally we got to board our flight to Amsterdam only to find out that we were using an old airplane again. For some reason they use old airplanes to Amsterdam all the time lately. Same with routes from Hong Kong to Rome I was told by a stewardess. But flights from Hong Kong to Milan do have new airplanes. All in all super uncomfortable chairs and again I got back pain during the flight. Really the worst I have experienced with intercontinental flights. On another note: big difference in treatment between business and economy. I mean yes business class and first class do have the right to be treated a bit different since they paid for it. But I haven't experienced a nice service from the crew unlike I am used to when flying other airlines. It would be nice if Cathay can have a look at this. For now I will choose another airline next time going to my home country.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-03;Flew HKG-DPS-HKG. First time in Cathay economy (usually a Star Alliance customer). Shocked at the lack of cleanliness on the plane. My seat was stained and had crumbs there was gum stuck to the seat frame in front of me as well as had jagged metal sticking out which kept grazing my skin and the blanket distributed had long hairs (not mine) all over it. Crumbs were all over the floor. Was disappointed with the poor food served the lack of water and the atrocious IFE. Had to repeatedly ask for the right headphones (not standard old fashioned) as I was given the wrong ones for the outlet.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-03;JFK to SIN. Cathay is nothing but consistent the cabin crew remain above average as long as you express your needs all the time. They will not come to your seat to ask what you need even turning down the bed. The ground crew are just awful to pay a premium fare to get abused like this almost leaves you in tears. The icing on the cake are the personnel at Asia miles I must have come within a whisker of having a heart attack. They are brutally bad. I think that Cathay ground crew must be looking up to BA and Qantas for inspiration. From now on I am going to try Qatar the extra couple of extra hours have to be worth it!;NEGATIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2013-12-02;Cathay is gradually deteriorating in standards. After many flights and years of experience I find that flights out of Hong Kong and Bangkok are always delayed awaiting Finnair or other partners by periods of over an hour. This adds 2 to 3 extra hours to a flight a panic transfer at Hong Kong to Australia. The apologies are insincere and automated. The crew are always too busy accommodating infants and business class to respond to requests. Seats have become less comfortable head sets are cheap and ill fitting flights full and cramped drink selection more restricted. This might make the airline meet its budget but the overall experience for travellers is very taxing. I will search for alternatives.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-28;Flew KUL to HKG A330 in Nov 2013 in business class. This aircraft fitted with the regional interior. Despite this being the old seat design it was reasonably comfortable for a flight of;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-27;BNE-HKG-LHR-HKG-BNE (with side travel to China on Dragonair on the way). Good usual Cathay service in Premium Economy I have found to be remarkably consistent over recent years (I tend to travel on Cathay to somewhere of other about once a month). Premium Economy is excellent if the smallish PE cabin is not full otherwise it can become rather claustrophobic. Cathay Pacific lounges are always first rate in my opinion - great for working or eating. Inflight food also seems to be improving. Only hassles I have is on very long sectors where I seem to have become the target of inconsiderate fellow passengers - getting kicked in the back every 20 minutes all the way from London to Hong Kong overnight is not much fun maybe a function of the seat pitch in PE. One can always pray for an upgrade!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-25;NKG-HKG-SFO-HKG-NKG round trip very cheap price compared to Singapore Airlines China Eastern and Air China (obviously much better service compared to those two Chinese airlines). One A321 and A330 between NKG and HKG and one B747 and B777 between HKG and SFO nice food and friendly staff though I was told there was no blanket for me for the last trip from HKG to NKG - luckily it was only a two hour flight. Leg space provided is excellent for B747 flight but less satisfactory for the B777 (especially for a 12 hour flight).;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-25;LHR-HKG-LHR Both flights on time. The business class seat is very comfortable and the features particularly storage are well thought out. Service on both sectors took a while to get going and the pork main course on the first sector was tough and chewy. No problem with the rest of the menu though. Entertainment options are fine but nowhere near as good as the likes of Emirates.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-20;Flew Heathrow-Hong Kong-Perth economy class. Had brilliant fights all round will be flying with them again next year.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-20;We travelled recently to Sydney Australia and also did internal flights with their sister company although long haul is never easy we cannot fault Cathay Pacific for there care and help as my husband cannot walk great distances and on all flights they had arranged wheelchair assistance and helped us as much as they could which made our journey much more pleasurable. Drinks were offered on a regular basis food was quite good for plane food and the staff were courteous and efficient. The only thing I would say if they could have a larger plane for the flights between Hong Kong and Sydney this would improve the long haul experience but I would still recommend this airline.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-18;Hong Kong to Narita B777-300ER. The seat is comfortable and one of the best in the world. Boarding was quick and economy seats were plush and comfy. Cabin crew were excellent as always. People who aren't happy with Economy Class service must have been spoilt by First Class too much.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-18;I have been on 6 flights in the past two years: two on the YYZ-HKG flight one on the JFK-HKG flight one on the HKG-KIX flight one on the NRT-HKG flight and finally on the HKG-ORD flight. All flights were consistently top- notch and very accommodating. Whenever I called for a steward/stewardess they were speedy and efficient. Food is good although there was less hot foods. Overall I would highly suggest Cathay Pacific to anyone especially for long-haul transpacific flights.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-18;I flew from Narita Airport with CX 501 and the staff service was fabulous. The beef was very tender and juicy. So overall it was the best flight and best service of all the other airlines! I strongly recommend this airline.;POSITIVE

cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-14;NRT-HKG. A330-300. Check-in and boarding very fast and efficient. Full load but crew proactively help pax to sit. Seat a bit narrow but still quite comfortable for a 5 hour flight. Food not good at all. No choice of hot meal just a chicken with rice and a strange gravy I hardly touched. Crew very friendly and IFE didn't use. Flight back HKG-NRT a few days later a a pretty new 777-300 with the shell seats I found quite spacious and comfortable there was no one sitting next to me so that helped. The male cabin crew attending my zone was friendly and engaging. This time you could opt for pork or pasta. I chose pasta and must say delicious together with a turkey salad which was very tasty. This time I used the IFE and music selection was good but movies had a too small selection in any other language than English. Overall a very good experience and wouldn't hesitate to use them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-05;My husband and I recently flew from Melbourne to Rome and returned London to Melbourne arriving yesterday. We were in Economy and the experience was the worst I have had on an International Flight. Two flights were delayed by 3 hours the first resulted in landing in Milan instead of Rome and then on Alitalia to Rome arriving several hours late. The seats were horribly uncomfortable my bottom was numb after a few hours - supposedly their fantastic new shell seats! The fourth flight was on a very old plane no new seats however the backs did not recline at all. Service was appalling cold unfriendly and unhelpful flight attendants. The toilet floors were sticky and wet after a short time and not cleaned All flights had 5-7 hours between meals with no offer of drinks at all. Our one request for a drink of wine outside of meal times was met with a grudging response and a 15 minute wait. The food was average the inflight entertainment basic. The only positive was that the check in staff in Melbourne Milan London and Hong Kong were friendly and welcoming. Never again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-04;"Have flown 6 USA to Hong Kong round trips over the past 18 months. First time on Cathay Pacific. The economy premium is a great product. I was lured to it by the seat and by the reputation for great service. They only deliver on the seat. The seat is much nicer than the premium economy seat in any USA-based carrier. By a lot. More legroom more recline slightly bigger screen. But the service is marginal. The attendants are SUPER friendly. But they are never around. They huddle in the far back galley and you need to dodge your way to the back of the plane if you want anything. They make 3 runs through the cabin on a 15 hour flight. I have since read that this is by design. That CP believes that they are offering ""privacy"" by not coming through the cabin. They seem to want you to ring the call button and that they will handle your requests with friendly urgency. This approach might be appropriate for domestic Chinese flights. But it just doesn't work with flights to/from America where we have been conditioned by surly flight attendants to keep our hands off the button except in cases of extreme emergency. I found myself wondering if I preferred the grouchy but available service of USA- based carriers or instead preferred the friendly but absent service of Cathay Pacific attendants. In the end the seat wins. My observation is that CP really wants to be a great airline and I think they are sincere in trying. They just need to better understand the markets they serve. Food was ok not great. Entertainment options were ok not great. Beverage selection was very poor. Limited choices. Inadequate supply.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-04;Flew economy Melbourne to Hong Kong trip to HK was ok but the return was not. Delayed for a couple of hours needed another plane. Service on board was good staff seem remote no smiles. I was surprised to see they seem to be using the older A330 's fleet - might need an upgrade. In all I was disappointed.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-04;Recent trip from LHR to HK in PE. Footrest jammed in the up position all the way. Unable to get out of seat without a lot of difficulty. Couldn't even put it down for landing so no chance of brace position if necessary. An all round awful experience. Never again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-11-01;Have flown 4 round trips all between LAX-HKG-BKK BKK-HKG-LAX. Both old and new business class seats are great but regarding to long haul flights between LAX-HKG the newer one is far better than the old one but not being as spoiled person the old one is still excellent. Even on 15hr 30 min flights it never bored due to excellent food sleeping on flat bed and entertainment. These are in 773ER. The regional flights between HKG-BKK all 773 772 and AB333 seats are not as big as 773ER but still really comfortable for short haul flights. All service are excellent!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-29;I am usually a fan of Cathay but they dropped the ball this time. MEL-HKG Scheduled 00.40 am take off came and passed before they let us known there was a problem. Kept telling us they would update us in 15 mins this went on for 2 hours before we received an SMS saying the plane was delayed to 3pm. This saw passengers approach staff at the desk who had no idea what was going on or about the new take off time. Finally they told us the plane needed a part which would be flown in from Brisbane so we would have to go home as there only a few hotel rooms available. After several hours we were given a cab voucher and finally had to leave through immigration and customs all off whom looked really peeved. Left the airport at about 4am to find no taxi's. Melbourne Airport staff made frantic calls to taxi companies. 45 mins later we were on the way home. Up at 11 am to get ready to head back to airport to find an SMS saying the flight was delayed to 10.30 pm that night. Finally boarded to find another problem with plane which thankfully they fixed and off we went. Service on board was fine PE seats ok with added leg room. Far to tired to care and tried to sleep most of the way. Cathay staff at Melbourne lost the plot when confronted with a problem. Get your act together.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-29;CX565 from Osaka to Hong Kong 20th Sep 13. This flight stop over is in Taipei. Staff on this flight not very courteous and not very helpful. When we reached Taipei the crew just hid they acted as if they had nothing to do with the passenger cleaners hopped on anto d clean up. A female crew came over to ask whether my child wanted a children's meal. I said there was no need to prepare a children's meal. I also have a baby I asked if my baby could have the children's meal. After a while a staff member came over to tell me that because the baby travels for free they are not supposed to have a meal. I just didn't realise the service from Business to Economy could can be so different.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-28;LAX to MNL with my handicapped sister May 2013 took business class to make sure that my sister was comfortable since she could not move the left side of her body and was in a wheelchair. Although I was told before I booked my flight that I will have to be responsible for transferring my sister to and from the wheelchair to her seat I was hoping that there would be kind people willing to help me out in case I needed it. Anyway I was pleasantly surprised that the airplane we took had some apparatus that would aid the handicapped to transfer to their seats (one was a long board that she could sit on and would slide her to the seat while the other was a lift sling that needed 3 people to carry her to her seat). The flight attendants were trained to do the manoeuvres although it did seem that not all of them were so familiar with how to use it but they were very eager to help us out. Although a mechanical error occurred during our flight from HKG to MNL and caused us to go back to MNL 20 mins into the flight to change airplanes (meaning repeating the whole process of transferring her from her seat to an inflight wheelchair to a regular wheelchair and then back to an inflight wheelchair and onto her airplane seat again). I was just very thankful that the staff of Cathay Pacific were very accommodating to us and would recommend this to those who have to travel with someone who is handicapped.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-28;HKG-YYZ a few months ago. First of all got thoroughly duped on their website with their infamously tricky pricing process. When they say 'total price' they still have not added their 15-20% additional carrier fees which they disguise as taxes. After arriving at the airport I am informed the flight is delayed 30 minutes. Once arriving at the gate I am then informed they have changed the gate and that the flight is now 45 minutes delayed. When I arrive at the new gate they have extended the delay by 15 minutes and then a few minutes later they covertly increase it by 15 minutes. So we're an hour and 15 minutes late out of the gate and the captain comes on and blames the typhoon (which was only a T1 and no other flights were delayed that I could see). The aircraft is tired and the cabin crew look about the same. After 15 hours of a very uncharming and shameless money grabbing experience (advertisements everywhere - before every video you watch about 3 of them and about 5 reminders of the duty free items being offered) we arrive at YYZ with the pilots not having made up any time at all likely to save fuel. The airline is obviously in financial distress (see the latest report) and it's been consistently poorly managed for the last few years. Another legacy carrier to add to the 3-4 star category methinks.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-25;MEL-HKG-AMS on 340-300. Truly terrible. Long Haul from HKG-AMS was 13 hours and was given 1 meal then 10 hours later we got breakfast which consisted of a sloppy omelette. Sure everyone complains about economy class food but 10 hours without even a cracker and cheese? I counted 7 hours without even being offered even a glass of water. If I needed a drink I had to take my water bottle to the rear and ask for it to be filled. The seats - they don't recline at the back but the bottom of the seat the part you sit on slides forward so your knees are pushed into the seat pocket in front offering no support whatsoever for your lower back. The seat pocket the elastic edge had lost it spring so did not hold magazines etc but just flopped onto your knees. And what is with the pouch that is on the strap of the seat beat so uncomfortable and bulky. Seat is very hard too and for a 13 hour flight very bad for circulation. The service was the worst of it I just don't understand where the staff were during all that time they were absent in the cabin. I'll never fly them again except I the return ticket for this trip I've already purchased.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-23;My wife and I flew PVG-HKG-KUL and back between the 28/9 and 6/10 on a variety of aeroplanes B744 A773 2 x A333 respectively. We found the website excellent to use (although had problems with payment) and it was great to be able to reserve seats at the time of booking. Check-in was perfectly adequate too. Sadly Cathay's planes are looking a bit ropey: the ones we had must have had an average age of about 17 years so the in-flight entertainment was poor (about six looping channels) and the whole cabin seemed tired. The cabin crew were very professional but some of the food was iffy. We found it poor that Cathay did not use a jetway to board passengers on the HKG - PVG flight. 300 people on shuttle buses is ridiculous. Overall they were alright better than the other Chinese airlines but nowhere near Malaysian Singapore or Korean airlines.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-23;LHR-HKG-LHR in Premium Economy class. No pre boarding for PE class passengers once onboard offered pre take-off drinks which included champagne on both flights. Excellent meals both flights offered Dinner and Breakfast and snacks were available during the flights. The seat is fairly comfortable and I'm 6ft 1in and found the legroom more than ample in fact on both flights I managed over 8 hours sleep. Lots of choices with entertainment movies TV during the flight. I would recommend Cathay Premium Economy Good value excellent Service I think people who write negative reviews about this class are expecting business class but need to remember this is not!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-23;HKG-Bali-HKG in Economy class on 777 (old shell seats). Flight time from HK to Bali changed twice prior to departure from 10.30am to 22.40hrs the evening before. Flight out only about 100 people on board so had plenty of room to spread out return flight full. Crew very attentive on both legs meal good and entertainment excellent Only complaint is the 'Shell Seats' I know Cathay are phasing these out and I can understand why these are not comfortable in the slightest and this flight was only 4.5hrs so I would dread to think what it would be like on a Long haul flight. Legroom for Economy was actually quite good at 6ft 1in I had no problems evening when I reclined the seat (which slides forward to the seat in front).;NEGATIVE

The recent experience confirmed the complaints that I have heard from my peers. CX has definitely moved to cost cutting affecting their most profitability section - the business class customers. During the inflight drink service the flight crews normally present the drink and a small plate of warm almonds On both trips they only offered the drinks and I would have to request for those warm almonds. Selection of food has reduced from 3 to 2. Amenities like salt and pepper that came in the beautiful shakers are removed completely. Upon asking you are presented with salt and pepper in small plastic container.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-20;"Dismal service on almost all 4 flights during a 2 week period. Singapore - Hong Kong business class with a 16 month old infant - the baby food meal was served after the adults were served so despite my requests my child got his food after 30min of smelling and observing everyone else eating - the meal was suitable for 3 month olds so of course he was tired and no longer interested. Hong Kong - Johannesburg: Cathay lounge personnel were very unhelpful I requested assistance from the lounge to boarding gate and was told I could get assistance an hour before boarding but not after that as they would be ""too busy"" so what do I pay a business class ticket for? The inflight meal for my son was served cold! By the time it was warmed up my son was asleep! Johannesburg - Hong Kong despite my carrying a child no one was there or offered to put my hand luggage away for me the meal for my child was once again cold I asked for an extra pillow it never came and staff just seemed to be 'short staffed' or too busy to care. Flight was delayed an hour resulting in my missing my connecting flight to Singapore. Hong Kong - Singapore: 3 hours and a very unhappy toddler later we boarded for Singapore. I had to put my bags away myself and had baby food not fit for my child. The inflight manager did try and offered a kids meal pasta dish and made regular attempts to make sure we were all right. I have flown many times before with all 3 of my children with Singapore Airlines and received far better service in business class. I pay a business class fare expecting a business class service. This was nowhere near the case with Cathay. Extremely disappointing - I cannot in good conscience recommend this airline on these legs to anyone and am very disappointed as I had previously held Cathay Pacific is such high esteem.";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-16;Me my wife and our 8 month old baby girl recently flew from Jakarta to Hong Kong. It was an Airbus 330 from Jakarta and Boeing 777 coming back from HK both flights were an excellent experience for all of us. From the starting point at Jakarta airport we found the level of service of Cathay staff are very helpful Cleanliness of the plane and toilet and positive attitude of the staff are the reasons I believe I will travel with this airline again in future and will definitely recommend it.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-13;I flew SYD - Hong Kong - Paris return and each time found the flight to be excellent. Airbus A330-777 - clean modern planes friendly efficient service flights on time nice food. Let's remember this is a plane not a 5 star restaurant. Given that there are 300 people in a fairly restricted space what else can you expect. Yes we did have the old 'shell' style seats for one of the legs which weren't that comfy but overall I would highly recommend Cathay to anyone. Friends flew Air China and met us at our destination now there's an airline you need to avoid like the plague we arrived fresh and happy they were 6 hours delayed awful food and no entertainment.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-13;My first time flying from Melbourne-Hong Kong on 22 Sep 13 / Hong Kong - Melbourne 4 Oct 13: Paid for the flight 7 months ahead of travel and was told I cannot select my seat until 48 Hrs before flight because it was a special fare. 48 Hrs prior to flying I checked in online hoping to select my seat. Turns out there was no option in seat selection because majority was already allocated and no one can change it - including Cathay Pacific staff. Purchasing special fares from all other airlines 7 months ahead would have given me the option to select my seat ahead of time and not leave me fretting about seats on my return flight. I can understand if this special fare was a last minute sale for seats that did not sell and very close to expiry - but 7 months ahead? My family ended up not being seated together for the return trip back to Melbourne because I was unable to check-in online. My travel agent did not know this rule existed with Cathay Pacific's special fares and was unable to help at all regardless of all the additional requests in our booking to seat us together and the choice of aisle or window seats. If I was told about this before payment I would have chosen another airline to fly.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-10;AKL-HKG and return. A340 both ways. Have not flown this route or airline for many years but had very good memories of past flights sadly this appeared to be a different airline altogether. Boarding was rather disorganised seemed to be totally at random. Crew seemed very eager to serve lunch after 1.30pm takeoff rapidly cleared trays ordered window shutters closed then disappeared for rest of flight. Only way to get a drink was to go to end of the aircraft and ask for one. No mid flight water or service was offered. Inflight movie selection was very dated and certainly not current. Old style corded remote. Could put up with all of the above but could not tolerate the seats the worst seat I have ever used in my entire life tolerable for 1-2 hours then agony fortunately seat back did not recline into your face but strange cushion arrangement which allows the seat cushion to move forward leaving no lower back support and a terrible slouching position. Totally useless had to ram pillows and blankets behind my back for some meagre support. If I had known how bad this would be I would certainly not have flown this airline. Fortunately I had an aisle seat and could easily get up and walk a little. Meals were usual economy fare just barely edible but nothing to rave about. Return flight from HKG started with a circus HK locals with seats all over the economy section boarded early and just grabbed seats in pairs regardless of seat numbers on their tickets. I had booked an aisle seat in row 32 6 months ago and boarded almost last on the plane my seat was long taken by someone whose seat was way back this rippled all the way through the front of economy and ended with 6 pax stranded at the front of economy with their seats taken cabin crew refused to move anyone and told us to just get seats that were left. Ended up in a window seat which I had tried so hard to avoid. Cabin crew couldn't seem to care less. Not a great experience all round and then 11 hours with that seat again never again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-07;20 Sep 13 ORD-HKG 777-300 ER. This is usually my route of choice to Hong Kong. CX uses the SAS lounge at O'Hare. Can get a bit cramped but the offerings are fine. Premium Economy was fine as always. Cheerful FA food ample and tasty. Good selection of AVOD. On time departure with an early arrival in Hong Kong.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-06;DXB-MNL via Hong Kong and back in Business Class. At Dubai airport the business class in T1 is the one of British Airways which I repute average. All four routes were served by an A330. I have flown business class with the new herringbone seating configuration. Excellent comfort and good privacy maybe not as good for keeping an eye on the window for those seating next to it but those saying you can't I must disagree I was still able to get a nice view. During the night flights I skipped the meals but must say even on a day flight as short as two hours the meal was good standard. Inflight system is very good and the screen is really wide with a nice selection of movies. The cabin crew was simply magnificent. Another very positive remark is the cabin temperature. Most airlines keep the inflight climate freezing cold while in all flights with CX the cabin temperature was simply perfect. In conclusion I booked this flight attracted by a low fare but the value for money is outstanding to say the least. Look forward to travel again hopefully soon with Cathay.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-02;I flew business from LHR to HKG and HKG to Melbourne. Boeing 747-400 on LHR to HKG leg was a little long in the tooth but service and food were excellent on both flights. Given the price would definitely recommend and fly with CX again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-10-01;Flew Heathrow to Melbourne. It was a pretty terrible experience all round. First flight to HKG was a 747-400. The seats were bizarre they did not recline but the seat slid forward a little bit and the support for the bottom of your back is rock hard. Terrible pockets on the seat in front mean if you put anything more than a newspaper in there the seat pocket is touching your knees. Also as with all Cathay flights I've been on there was no personal air conditioning control. Food as always was terrible - 2 meals on a 12 hour flight both of which were not nice at all. Breakfast choice always seems to be an egg based dish or seafood congee. I'd rather just have cereal next time. The dinner is always a choice of an oversalted Asian dish a vegetarian pasta dish or something else unappetising. Having already flown the opposite route we luckily knew to take snacks on board so we didn't starve. With Qantas / Emirates I usually end up feeling almost overfed not with Cathay though where you feel like you're in prison. With 2 or 3 hours before landing when breakfast was about to be served my girlfriend noticed that a child on the seat in front had been sick which had trickled between the seats and gone all over her tracksuit pants which were on the floor in front. We tried to get the cabin crews assistance but they continually ignored us. We ended up just putting them in a bag and then throwing them away. Never again! I'd rather pay an extra $300 to fly Qantas / Emirates than fly with Cathay again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-30;I travelled from Mumbai to Hong Kong then Hong Kong to Sydney. The ticketing/seating on the leg from Hong Kong to Sydney was horrendous! So many people were affected by the poor organisation of the airline. There was a huge bank of people at the desk trying to get seats changed because they could not sit with people they had booked with. Then on the plane itself people were swapping all over the place. I'm only complaining about seating which when you are unable to sit with your friend or relative on a long trip who cares about the rest?;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-29;Flew Premium Economy from HK to London in my opinion it is not worth the extra and does not live up to the promise of better food choices and wines etc. One choice of wine not a choice of several meals but just two. For toilets you have to go back to economy and wait in a queue. Seats were good but not several hundred dollars worth of good. Staff on this flight were good. We got caught up in the Tropical Cyclone Usagi debacle little information and a useless website. For an airline that says that customer service is a priority it has let itself down badly.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-29;Flew from Sydney to Hong Kong - very disappointed. The seat is comfortable but the service was quite poor. Some cabin crews were rude with no smile. The catering was disappointing and the portion was quite small. Won't fly this airline again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-24;Flew AKL to Heathrow via Hong Kong and return. Flew in 3 different aircraft types. Really excellent staff and food. Very nice seat comfort especially 777ER with a space for everything. Had read negative comments about the coffin class on A340-300 but actually found them quite good. A little disappointed in film selection but most of the flights were at night so didn't matter too much. Very happy to recommend business class with Cathay Pacific and would fly with them again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-22;The Business class alas is not for families and those who want to sit next to each other and talk. It is designed almost exclusively for people traveling by themselves. I have a 3 year old (and he was 2 years old and I had still purchased a separate seat for him) but a child this young needs someone next to him for all the obvious reasons. Unfortunately the designers did not make any allowance for people like myself. What a pity. The staff were nice and helpful but I will not want to travel in Business class in Cathay again unless I am by myself which is hardly ever the case.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-19;HKG-TSA-KIX and return. Very nice staff but its the only good thing that I can say about this flight. In both flights I flew 777 but different cabin types. First time it was old type Economy seats was ok very poor entertainment on flight but in return it was New Economy Class and its terrible even in 5 hours flights. I don't know what they were thinking when they made seats that do not actually recline!;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-15;Dubai - Hong Kong - Sydney. I have flown this route with Cathay now 3 times in the last 5 months in the new business class. It takes me an extra six odd hours on this route with the stop over rather than with Qantas direct however that's where the negatives stop. Considering the price which is consistently 2000 dollars less expensive return and what I regard as a better product than QF (seats all have aisle access much more privacy etc) it's a no brainer. Cathay every time as the saving/product far out weighs the extra travel time. The inflight service food and all round package has for me Has been consistently excellent as well. Will continue with them for all my travel!;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-12;I had not flown CX for some time but was massively disappointed. 3 of the 4 business class flights (UK - Hong Kong - Singapore) were in seats that should have been scrapped years ago (747 especially). It was like travelling in an old coffin. The equipment was ancient I have not seen such poor seats and screens in other airlines for at least ten years. The screen at one time gave a message that Heathrow terminal 5 would be opening in March 2008 and that care should be taken when using Heathrow. This is amazingly poor. The food was more like economy standard than business. The choice of films and other entertainment was limited with very few recent films. The whole experience was not what I expect from a 'quality' airline. The only redeeming factor was that most of the staff were very helpful.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-11;MNL-HKG-LHR. While the new reclining economy seats on its 777s are certainly appreciated service levels continue to be eroded. Online check-in did not open until 12 hours before the flight - I suspect because I was departing from MNL - which meant that there were hardly any seats available to select on the HKG-LHR flight. Food was generally bad and of course they ran out of options. Cathay now serves tap water which would be fine were it not that there was a very bleachy aftertaste in the water served on the flight to London. Cathay seems unable to serve cold drinks. Having recently flown long haul with Singapore Airlines I would say that there is a vast difference between these two airlines' economy offerings with Cathay much the worse.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-11;Business class Sydney-Hong Kong-Milan (points reward ticket). Excellent flights . Seats very comfortable service superb in all aspects. Would definitely recommend.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-11;Id originally booked my SYD-LHR flight with Virgin Atlantic. The day before my flight I was informed that the incoming flight to HKG from LHR had been sent back to LHR due to engine problems. I was then rebooked on Qantas SYD to HKG then Cathay Pacific HKG to LHR. I was upgraded to Business on the SYD-HKG leg then had a 6 hour lay over in HKG. All attempts to get the window seat I had requested met with apologies as the flight was full. I am used to a little more room given the fact that I am spending the extra dollars on the Premium Economy cabin. The configuration was 2-4-2. I was stuck in the middle and as soon as the meal service had ended and the trays collected the whole row in front of my row reclined their seats making it impossible to get out of the seat without disturbing my neighbour. Which meant that for the entire 12 hour flight from HKG to LHR I was only able to get up once during the flight to go to the toilet. It would make more sense to remove an entire row and space the cabin accordingly. I can't imagine how bad the Economy section was. I will never travel Cathay Pacific again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-10;NRT-HKG SIN-HKG and HKG-SFO September 1st 3rd and 5th respectively. First two flights were in Business Class on an A330 - lots of room great service and food. Studio C entertainment worked well and flights were on time. HKG-SFO flight was in First Class and on a 747-400. There were 4 passengers in the cabin and the service was excellent. 3 Flight Attendants and I felt like I was in a 5-Star hotel and restaurant. Having flown them before on the 777-300ER in First I was aware of their service/food etc. but this flight surpassed previous experiences. It is one of those times when you wished it did not have to end. The bed on the 747 and 777-300ER is the best I have experienced. The seat alone at 36 inches wide is enough space for two people. I hope to fly Cathay Pacific again.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-10;I booked a flight from Moscow to Hong Kong - it was horrible. The plane was malfunctioning and instead of getting us off the plane they left us sitting there for 7 hours. They finally let us off the plane and sent us to the transit area - without information or water for 3 hours. Then they let us wait another 12 hours at least in the Business Lounge. After the 12 hours they announced that we would have to wait for another 18 hours to get our flight - that's when we snapped and they re-booked us with Emirates via Dubai. Cathay lost our luggage that arrived three days later.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-09;Hong Kong - Sydney Premium Economy. After a pretty poor experience Sydney - Hong Kong earlier in the year I was quite pleased with this flight. Received a champagne after boarding the business class main course was very nice. Korean member of crew on my aisle was very customer focused. Seats are decent sized and allowed about 5 hours sleep before a nice hot breakfast. Only downsides were limited choice and refilling of drinks and long way and wait for the bathroom.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-09;I flew CX 827 from Toronto-Hong Kong originally I was supposed to be on CX 826 but was cancelled due to engine failure. I was rescheduled on the next flight and was given $100 to spend on food at the airport. I have been flying with the airline since 2000 and I enjoy the service friendly flight attendants and the flight although the food could use some improvement. I recommend the airline.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-08;Just flew HKG-SFO in Premium Economy. It's ok nothing special. I am a vegetarian and ordered a special meal. They serve your special meal at least 30 minutes prior to serving the other passengers so it seems quite strange (you're there eating and nobody else is) then you don't get a drink until they serve the other passengers so I was done with my meal and my tray sat there for about 1.5 hours. Did not get any other amenities they are supposed to give you a small amenity kit but nobody got one on this flight. Not really sure it's worth the extra cost of the ticket. If you're used to business class premium economy will be a big disappointment in my opinion.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-02;Checked in for my flight at Rome International Airport to Auckland New Zealand via Hong Kong. Queued to board when a Cathay Pacific hostess said there was a delay to go have lunch then return at 1pm. I returned at 1pm. My flight was still not boarding and no staff present. Waited a further 2 hours before any staff were present to answer questions. Told the flight had been delayed until 9am the next morning to go to the Hilton hotel and those with connecting flights will receive information once there. No explanation for the delay. In the morning we were told that connecting flights would be arranged once we landed at Hong Kong. No boarding gate was given security would not let us through as our boarding passes were for the day before Cathay Pacific staff failed to inform them we were coming. Once at the gate we were told of a further delay until 4pm. Told there were no seats on that days flight to Hong Kong. I was informed my connecting flight from Hong Kong to Auckland would be rescheduled and would be available when I landed. This did not happen. Staff at Hong Kong put me on a later flight. I am extremely annoyed at how the situation was handled. I will never fly Cathay Pacific again.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-09-01;Just returned from Germany on PE Cathay Pacific. Flew SYD to HKG seated in 30 D and E. Priority Check In and Boarding in Sydney plenty of Legroom (Bulkhead Seat). Champagne as promised good Meal good Seat Comfort except short Seat Base for good under thigh support. Footrest useless only suitable for very short people used Pillow on lower part of Legrest instead. HKG to FRA seated in 31 D and E. No Priority Boarding found out on return leg that we could have boarded with Business and First (no Announcements). Less Legroom because Bulkhead was closer but still plenty of room. PE Cabin had their own toilet unlike previous Flight where we had to share Economy Toilet. Same Seats Champagne and good Food. On Return Priority Check in and Boarding in Frankfurt same Seats as previously. Food was worse and Service less friendly. On the last leg from HKG to SYD not as attentive as on the way over. All up good Product but could be improved in some Areas.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-27;"I just flew for the first time with Cathay Pacific Premium Economy and was very disappointed. Plastic glasses slanted TV screens in first row thin blankets extremely mediocre food even for the ""Hong Kong chef special"" only one wine choice for either white or red and red wine was freezing cold. The service was very inattentive - no refills on wine for example. Poor wine quality. Uncomfortable seats and very weak selection of movies. Also lots of confusion at boarding whether premium economy can board with business or just economy. Compare this to Qantas premium economy: nice food on a white tablecloth with real plates and real glasses. good selection of wines. thick blanket. attentive service-you feel almost like business class. comfortable and attractive seats. How does Cathay get a good reputation?";NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-26;Was a trip of 2 halves. Flew out on July 18 and the service from AKL-HKG-LHR was amazing great food attentive staff comfortable seats and excellent inflight entertainment. Flew home on 18 August and what a difference. Food was average and the crew disappeared for most of the flight. In addition the reclining seats were frustrating and annoying.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-22;CX872 Aug 18. I just got back from a trip from Hong Kong to San Francisco in economy Plus. There is no priority boarding like they advertise. You will board with the regular economy class. My TV monitor did not work.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-21;Flown 7 Cathay flights in 2 weeks. Can't say I love them. The new shell seats are the most uncomfortable seats ever! Food very average especially as I ordered vegetarian meals. Bland and carb filled. Terrible service at the airport in HK. Flew Colombo-Singapore-HKG with a 7 hour stopover before MEL. On their website it says those with a transit time of over 4 hours can access their lounges. Upon arriving at one of them we were abruptly told no this is for business class and first class or members only. Won't fly them again. They were on time though.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-14;Sydney to HKG premium economy. Flight cancelled by SMS due to typhoon. Struggled to contact Sydney office ended up buying new ticket myself. PE class very empty and business class very empty too  even though I asked for upgrades due to extra cost and inconvenience. Seats etc good not much cabin presence as lights turned off. Food ok but really just a slight step up from economy. Think pricing wrong for this class as cabin always empty or filled on upgrades. Contacting CX while in Australia hard as phone line just went dead.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-14;Hong Kong to Singapore on CX711 on 8 August 2013. The seats were narrow with no room space to straighten legs. Worse when the passenger in front row reclines their seat. Food is terrible tasteless and meatless. Service is slow. Requested warm water and they took ages to serve it. Inflight entertainment is also a disappointment and during my return flight my inflight entertainment is faulty and there was no entertainment for me throughout my entire journey. I am sorry to say that in general budget flights have better service quality and seats.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-12;Just returned to HK from JFK on CX 831. As usual CX service food condition of the cabin etc. were all top notch and we had a great flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-12;Shanghai to Taipei via HK. The boarding process was normal the service is given on family name terms. The food is nice looking but the quantity is not enough. FAs walk around the cabin every 3 minutes asking whether you need anything. They are nice and talkative. Felt at home on board.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-08;HKG to Sydney. Flight was on Airmiles. Lounge lovely as boarding boarding fine and economy cabin was clean and fresh. Great crew throughout really helpful. Food nice all thought and the AVOD is excellent. PE class almost empty asked if I could pay for upgrade told no. Excellent Cathay service.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-06;I flew CP from Seoul to Narita Japan last year in 1st class. Staff were exceptionally solicitous and almost desperate to help in any way they could. Everyone was very polite. Cabin was spotlessly clean and very well- appointed. Food was delicious. Service was superb. Cannot fault it.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-06;I have just got back to Melbourne from Rome via Hong Kong flying and I was very disappointed. The food was terrible myself my husband and our son could hardly eat any of the meals and when asked if they had any crackers they said the only snack they can offer is peanuts or noodles. Flight CX929 from Rome to Hong Kong after pressing my button for assistance and waiting over 45 mins I noticed people walking to the back of the plane and coming back with drinks? A fellow passenger informed me there was only one stewardess on duty and we had to get the drinks ourselves. As to the snacks offered you can imagine my surprise when my husband came to me and offered chocolate bars. He said the stewardess offered them to him. I must however say that our flight from HK to Melbourne was nothing like this there were lots of staff on duty except food was just as terrible and snacks offered were peanuts and noodles.;NEGATIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-06;CX 506 from HKG to KIX on 31/7 and CX 567 return on 7/8. Flew a 22-year old B747-400 on the first flight. Shell seat was not a problem for me. Food (pasta) was good and a wide-selection of inflight entertainment. Staff were really mediocre not outstanding. Flew on a 10-year old A330-300 on the return flight. Seat was fine although quite narrow. Old inflight entertainment system and only a few channels to choose from. Food was edible. Staff were not impressive and I should say definitely below Cathay Pacific standard for both flights. Ground staff at Hong Kong International Airport were fair but the check-in staff at Kansai International Airport was excellent and helpful.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-04;BKK-HKG. Took the 1.20am Thursday July 26 CX706 red-eye from BKK-HKG. Plane took off about 2am. I took a chance and didn't bother to book the emergency exit seat and it paid off as there was plenty of room for me to lay out across the 3 seats in the centre section. Plane had the new economy seating and much more comfortable than the old shell seats. Leg room much better than the hopeless alternative on Thai Air. Staff as usual helpful and attentive. Silly little snack packs provided but at that time of the morning not too bothered. Overall pleasant flight.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-04;AKL to Hong Kong [partial return of my July journey]. Airbus 340/300 with the coffin like seats I have commented on before. I struggle to see why Cathay are a 5* airline. Again I find the service to be OK but just OK. I missed out on a pre take off drink because no one noticed I had arrived and sat down. After that the service is functional but not pro active. You needed to get up and ask for anything and again I saw no cabin walk through. This was a 12 hour mid day flight so they served lunch and then after 6 hours [with 6 to go] they served dinner which very few wanted [most were asleep] and then after the main course that was it - nothing more. Strange. The next part of the journey home is later today this will be the new business class on the Boeing 777. Overall if the price was very good then I would use them again but other far east and middle east airlines are ahead of the game. Not overly impressed mainly because of the lack of service.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-04;The last leg of my 4 flights (LHR-AKL via Hong Kong return) for those of you that have been following me. Really just the same comments. The new business class seat on the 777 is brilliant and very much ahead of other airlines especially with the 1x2x1 seating. Great comfort storage and privacy also great to have two biz cabins one with only 2 rows in (always get that one if you can). However the service on the ground and in the air still seems just 'OK' and leaves me pondering on how they maintain their 5* rating. Food was very good but lack of service in the cabin makes me think that I will always only fly them again for a very good price and the seat so long as I can get the window one. Other Middle East and Far East airlines offer a better overall product for a premium passenger.;POSITIVE
cathay-pacific-airways;2013-08-04;Recently completed a round trip on SFO-HKG-MAA sector in Premium Economy. Outbound was on 777 and return on 747. Outbound we managed to get front row seats which were extremely comfortable roomy. Return we had two seats in the front and two in back but we swapped with fellow passengers so all four of us sat in the last row. The front row seats had much less room than 777. If you want front row seats make sure you get the side rows and not the center. In 777 it makes no difference as there is a ton of room in both center and side row seats. Food is not bad for Indian vegetarian. Toiletry bag is of inferior quality compared to Emirates Economy and SQ economy. CX offers the shortest connection to MAA from west coast. Flying time of roughly 13 hours to HKG and 12 hours return to SFO. HKG to MAA and return is roughly 5 hours. Service is pretty decent although SQ rates higher IMHO. Premium Economy is worth if you get front row seats otherwise not sure unless you are unable to fit comfortably in Economy seats.;POSITIVE
